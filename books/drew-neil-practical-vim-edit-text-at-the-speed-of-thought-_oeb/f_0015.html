<h2 id="N106A4" class="calibre19">On the Role of Vim Script</h2>
<p id="N106A8" class="calibre4">
      Vim script enables us to add new functionality to Vim or to change existing functionality. It’s a complete scripting language in itself and a subject worthy of a book of its own. <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> is not that book.
    </p>
<p id="N106B1" class="calibre4">
      But we won’t steer clear of the subject entirely. Vim script is always just below the surface, ready to do our bidding. We’ll see a few examples of how it can be used for everyday tasks in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0036.html#sec.insert.expression">Tip 16</a>; <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0101.html#sec.macro.increment">Tip 70</a>; <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0129.html#sec.substitute.arithmetic">Tip 94</a>; and <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0130.html#sec.substitute.swap">Tip 95</a>.
    </p>
<p id="N106C4" class="calibre4">
<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> shows you how to get by with Vim’s core functionality. In other words, no third-party plugins assumed. I’ve made an exception for <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0120.html#sec.visual.star">Tip 86</a>, and <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0131.html#sec.substitute.in.project">Tip 96</a>. In each case, the plugin I’ve recommended adds a feature that I find indispensable. And in each case, the plugin requires very little code—less than ten lines of Vim script. Both examples demonstrate how easily Vim’s functionality can be extended. The implementation of <code class="cf">visual-star.vim</code> and <code class="cf">Qargs.vim</code> is presented inline without explanation. This should give you an idea of what Vim script looks like and what you can accomplish with it. If it piques your interest, then so much the better.

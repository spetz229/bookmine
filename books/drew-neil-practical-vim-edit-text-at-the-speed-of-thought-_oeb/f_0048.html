    Vim traces its ancestry back to vi, which is where the modal editing paradigm was conceived. In turn, vi traces its ancestry back to a line editor called ex, which is why we have Ex commands. The DNA of these early Unix text editors is preserved in modern Vim. For some line-oriented tasks, Ex commands are still the best tool for the job. In this chapter, weâ€™ll learn how to use Command-Line mode, which exposes us to the vestiges of ex.

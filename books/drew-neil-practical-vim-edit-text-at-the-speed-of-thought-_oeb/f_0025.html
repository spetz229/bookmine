    Normal mode is Vim’s natural resting state. If this chapter seems surprisingly short, then that’s because most of this book is about how to use Normal mode! Here, however, is where we cover some core concepts and general tips.
  </p>
<p id="N11137" class="calibre4">
    Other text editors spend most of their time in something that resembles Insert mode. So to the Vim newcomer, it can seem strange that Normal mode is the default. In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0026.html#sec.brushstrokes">Tip 7</a>, we’ll begin explaining why this is by drawing an analogy with the workspace of a painter.
  </p>
<p id="N11143" class="calibre4">
    Many Normal mode commands can be executed with a count, which causes them to be run multiple times. In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0029.html#sec.count.arithmetic">Tip 10</a>, we’ll meet a pair of commands that increment and decrement numerical values and see how these commands can be combined with a count to do simple arithmetic.
  </p>
<p id="N1114A" class="calibre4">
    Just because you can save keystrokes by using a count doesn’t mean that you should. We’ll look at some examples where it’s better simply to repeat a command than take the time to count how many times you want to execute it.
  </p>
<p id="N1114D" class="calibre4">
    Much of the power of Normal mode stems from the way that operator commands can be combined with motions. We’ll finish by looking at the consequences of this.

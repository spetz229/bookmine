<h2 id="N1019C" class="calibre19">Get to Know Vim’s Built-in Documentation</h2>
<p id="N101A0" class="calibre4">
      The best way to get to know Vim’s documentation is by spending time in it. To help out, I’ve included “hyperlinks” for entries in Vim’s documentation. For example, here’s the “hyperlink” for the Vim tutor: <strong xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" class="calibre10">vimtutor</strong>
<a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_01.html#vimtutor">
<img alt="info" src="images/information.png" class="calibre21"/>​</a>.
    </p>
<p id="N101AA" class="calibre4">
      The icon has a dual function. First, it serves as a signpost, drawing the eye to these helpful references. Second, if you’re reading this on an electronic device that’s connected to the Internet, you can click the icon and it will take you to the relevant entry in Vim’s online documentation. In this sense, it truly is a hyperlink.
    </p>
<p id="N101B0" class="calibre4">
    But what if you’re reading the paper edition of the book? Not to worry. If you have an installation of Vim within reach, simply enter the command as it appears in front of the icon.</p>
<p id="N101B8" class="calibre4">For example, type <code class="cf">:h vimtutor</code> (<code class="cf">:h</code> is an abbreviation for the <code class="cf">:help</code> command). Consider this a unique address for the documentation on vimtutor: a URL of sorts. In this sense, the help reference is a kind of hyperlink to Vim’s built-in documentation.

          In this part of the book, we’ll learn how to work with files and buffers. Vim lets us work on multiple files in a single editing session. We can view them one at a time or divide our workspace into split windows or tabs, each containing a separate buffer. We’ll look at several different ways of opening files from inside Vim. We’ll also learn a couple of workarounds for common gotchas that may prevent us from saving our buffers to a file.

        We’ve considered three simple editing tasks so far. Even though each problem was different, we found a solution using the dot command for each one. In this tip, we’ll compare each solution and identify a common pattern—an optimal editing strategy that I call the </span>Dot Formula. 
    </p>
<h3 class="calibre22">Reviewing Three Dot-Command Editing Tasks</h3>
<p id="N110D6" class="calibre4">
        In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0019.html#sec.line.append">Tip 2</a>, we wanted to append a semicolon at the end of a sequence of lines. We changed the first line by invoking <span class="calibre17">A</span>
<code class="cf">;&lt;Esc&gt;</code>, which set us up so that we could use the dot command to repeat the change on each subsequent line. We could move between lines using the <span class="calibre17">j</span> command, and the remaining changes could be completed simply by pressing <span class="calibre17">j.</span> as many times as necessary.
      </p>
<p id="N110E8" class="calibre4">
        In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0020.html#sec.pad.with.spaces">Tip 3</a>, we wanted to pad each occurrence of the <code class="cf">+</code> symbol with a space both in front and behind. We used the <span class="calibre17">f+</span> command to jump to our target and then the <span class="calibre17">s</span> command to substitute one character with three. That set us up so that we could complete the task by pressing <span class="calibre17">;.</span> a few times.
      </p>
<p id="N110FB" class="calibre4">
        In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0022.html#sec.cw.ndot">Tip 5</a>, we wanted to substitute every occurrence of the word “content” with the word “copy.” We used the <span class="calibre17">*</span> command to initiate a search for the target word and then ran the <span class="calibre17">cw</span> command to change the first occurrence. This set us up so that the <span class="calibre17">n</span> key would take us to the next match and the <span class="calibre17">.</span> key would apply the same change. We could complete the task simply by pressing <span class="calibre17">n.</span> as many times as it took.
      </p>
<h3 class="calibre22">The Ideal: One Keystroke to Move, One Keystroke to Execute</h3>
<p id="N11115" class="calibre4">
        In all of these examples, using the dot command repeats the last change. But that’s not the only thing they share. A single keystroke is all that’s required to move the cursor to its next target.
      </p>
<p id="N11118" class="calibre4">
        We’re using one keystroke to move and one keystroke to execute. It can’t really get any better than that, can it? It’s an ideal solution.
We’ll see this editing strategy coming up again and again, so for the sake of convenience, we’ll refer to this pattern as the Dot Formula.

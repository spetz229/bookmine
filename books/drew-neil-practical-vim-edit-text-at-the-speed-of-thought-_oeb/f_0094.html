    Vim offers more than one way to repeat changes. We’ve already learned about the dot command, which is useful for repeating small changes. But when we want to repeat anything more substantial, we should reach for Vim’s macros. Using these, we can record any number of keystrokes into a register and then play them back.
  </p>
<p id="N16FDC" class="calibre4">
    Macros are ideal for repeating changes over a set of similar lines, paragraphs, or even files. We’ll discover that there are two ways of executing a macro across a set of targets—playing it back in series or running it multiple times in parallel—and we’ll learn when to use each one. 
  </p>

    When recording a sequence of commands, there’s always the chance that we’ll make a mistake. But we needn’t discard a bad take. We can easily append commands to the end of an existing macro. For more extensive amendments, we can even paste the macro into a document, edit the sequence of commands in place, and then yank it back into a register.

    Sometimes we need to insert consecutive numbers into our text. In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0097.html#sec.macro.count">Tip 66</a>, we’ll learn how to do that with a method that uses rudimentary Vim script in combination with the expression register.
  </p>
<p id="N16FE9" class="calibre4">Like the game of Othello, Vim’s macros take a minute to learn and a lifetime to master. But everyone—from beginners to experts—can get a lot of value from this feature that makes it easy to automate tasks. Let’s see how.</p>

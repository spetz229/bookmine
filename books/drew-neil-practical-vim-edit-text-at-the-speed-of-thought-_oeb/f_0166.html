<h2 id="N1C2D5" class="calibre19">21.2 Make Vim Your Own</h2>
<p id="N1C2DA" class="calibre4">
      We’ve been working with stock Vim pretty much as it runs out of the box. The factory settings have served as a useful baseline, giving us a common feature set to work with, but I don’t mean to suggest that you stick with them. Vim has some unfortunate default settings. If you want to know why something behaves a certain way, the answer often seems to be, “Because that’s how <code class="cf">vi</code> did it!”
    </p>
<p id="N1C2EB" class="calibre4">
      But you don’t need to put up with those defaults. You can customize Vim to make it behave the way you want. If you save your preferences in a <code class="cf">vimrc</code> file, you can make it so that Vim is always configured in a way that suits your workflow. <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0168.html#appendix.vimrc">Appendix 1, ​<em class="calibre5">Customize Vim to Suit Your Preferences</em>​</a>, provides a basic primer to get you started.

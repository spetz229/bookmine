    Having studied Vim’s regular expression engines in the previous chapter, let’s see how we can put them to use with the search command. We’ll start with the basics: how to execute a search, highlight matches, and jump between them. Then we’ll learn a couple of tricks that exploit Vim’s incremental search feature, which not only gives us instant feedback but can also save us typing by autocompleting our match. We’ll also learn how to count the number of matches that occur in a document.
  </p>
<p id="N18ACF" class="calibre4">
    The search offsets feature allows us to position our cursor relative to a match. We’ll look at one scenario where search offsets can streamline our workflow. Then we’ll see how search offsets can be exploited to operate on a complete search match.
  </p>
<p id="N18AD2" class="calibre4">
    Composing a regular expression—and getting it right—often takes a few attempts, so developing a workflow that allows us to iterate on a pattern is important. We’ll learn about two methods for doing this: calling up our search history and working in the command-line window.
  </p>
<p id="N18ADF" class="calibre4">
    Have you ever wished for a simple way of searching for text that’s already present in your document? We’ll finish by devising a simple customization that overrides the <span class="calibre17">*</span> command to search for the current visual selection.

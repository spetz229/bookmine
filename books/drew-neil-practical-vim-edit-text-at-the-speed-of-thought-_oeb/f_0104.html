    In this part of the book, we’ll talk about search, substitute, and global commands. But first, we’ll focus on the core that drives each of them: Vim’s search engine. Have you ever wondered how Vim’s regular expressions work or how to turn them off? 
  </p>
<p id="N18098" class="calibre4">
    Vim’s regular expression engine may be somewhat different from the one you’re accustomed to using. We’ll see that the most confusing discrepancies can be smoothed out with the <code class="cf">very magic</code> pattern switch. Certain characters have a special meaning <span class="calibre5">by default</span> in Vim’s search field, which can complicate matters when we just want to match something verbatim. We’ll learn how to disable all of these special meanings at a stroke, with the <code class="cf">very nomagic</code> literal switch.
  </p>
<p id="N180A4" class="calibre4">
    We’ll focus on a couple of special items that can be used in Vim’s patterns: zero-width delimiters that can mark the boundaries of a word or a search match. We’ll finish with an in-depth discussion of how to deal with the handful of characters that retain special meaning, even when we use the  <code class="cf">\V</code> literal switch.

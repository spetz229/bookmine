        While Vim allows us to insert any character by its numeric code, these can be hard to remember and awkward to type. We can also insert unusual characters as <span class="calibre5">digraphs</span>: pairs of characters that are easy to remember.
    </span>
</p>
<p id="N11C28" class="calibre4">
      Digraphs are easy to use. From Insert mode, we just type <span class="calibre17">&lt;C-k&gt;{char1}{char2}</span>. So if we wanted to insert the “¿” character, which is represented by the digraph <code class="cf">?I</code>, we would simply type <span class="calibre17">&lt;C-k&gt;?I</span>.
    </p>
<p id="N11C34" class="calibre4">
      The character pairs that make up a digraph are chosen to be descriptive, making them easier to remember or even guess. For example, the double-angle quotation marks « and » are represented by the digraphs <code class="cf">&lt;&lt;</code> and <code class="cf">&gt;&gt;</code>; the vulgar (or common) fractions ½, ¼, and ¾ are represented by the digraphs <code class="cf">12</code>, <code class="cf">14</code>, and <code class="cf">34</code>, respectively. The default set of digraphs that ship with Vim follows certain conventions, which are summarized under <strong xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" class="calibre10">digraphs-default</strong>

    </p>
<p id="N11C4A" class="calibre4">
      We can view a list of the available digraphs by running <code class="cf">:digraphs</code>, but the output of this command is difficult to digest. A more usable list can be found by looking up <strong xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" class="calibre10">digraph-table</strong>

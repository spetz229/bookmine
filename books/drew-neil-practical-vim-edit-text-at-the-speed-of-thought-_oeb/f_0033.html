        If we make a mistake while composing text in Insert mode, we can fix it immediately. There’s no need to change modes. Besides the backspace key, we can use a couple of other Insert mode commands to make quick corrections.
    </span>

<p id="N11855" class="calibre4">
      Touch typing is more than just not looking at the keyboard; it means doing it by feel. When touch typists make an error, they know it even before their eyes process the information on the screen in front of them. They feel it in their fingers, like a misplaced step.
    </p>
<p id="N1185B" class="calibre4">
      When we make a typing error, we can use the backspace key to erase the mistake and then make a correction. As long as the error appears near the end of the word, this may be the quickest strategy for making amends. But what if the mistake was at the start of the word?
    </p>
<p id="N11861" class="calibre4">
      Expert typists recommend drastic measures: delete the entire word; then type it out again. If you can type at a rate above sixty words per minute, retyping a word from scratch will only take a second. If you can’t type that fast, consider this to be good practice! There are particular words that I consistently mistype. Since I started following this advice, I’ve become more aware of which words trip me up. As a result, I now make fewer mistakes.
    </p>
<p id="N11864" class="calibre4">
      Alternatively, you could switch to Normal mode, navigate to the start of the word, fix the error, then hit <span class="calibre17">A</span> to return to where you left off in Insert mode. That little dance could take longer than a second, and it would do nothing to improve your touch-typing skills. Just because we can switch modes doesn’t mean that we should.

      In Insert mode, the backspace key works just as you would expect: it deletes the character in front of the cursor. The following chords are also available to us:

      These commands are not unique to Insert mode or even to Vim. We can also use them in Vim’s command line as well as in the bash shell.

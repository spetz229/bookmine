    Autocompletion saves us from typing out entire words. Given the first letters of a word, Vim builds a list of suggested endings and lets us choose our favorite. Whether or not this is of any use to us depends on how adept we are at interacting with that list of suggestions. We’ll learn a few tricks for working with the autocomplete menu in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0153.html#sec.auto.popup">Tip 112</a>.

<a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0152.html#sec.meet.auto.comp">Tip 111</a>, introduces the basics of keyword autocompletion. The list of suggested completions is created by scanning all files that have been opened in the current editing session, as well as any included files and tag files. We’ll find out what this means in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0154.html#sec.keyword.origins">Tip 113</a>, and see how we can narrow down the list of suggestions.
  </p>
<p id="N1B952" class="calibre4">
    Besides keywords, Vim has other ways of building a list of suggestions. <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0152.html#table.autocomplete.types">Table 29, ​<em class="calibre5">A Summary of Vim’s Autocomplete Methods</em>​</a>, lists some of the highlights, each of which is covered by a tip in this chapter.

    To make the most of Vim’s autocomplete functionality, we need to understand two things: how to dial up the most relevant suggestions and how to choose the right word from the list. We’ll address each of these topics in the following tips.
  </p>
<div class="sidebar" id="sidebar.ignorecase.autocomplete">
<div class="sidebar-title">Autocompletion and Case Sensitivity</div>
<div class="calibre1">
<p id="N1B964" class="calibre4">
      Vim’s search command treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent when the <code class="cf1">‘ignorecase’</code> option is enabled (as discussed in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0105.html#sec.case.sensitivity">Tip 72</a>), but there’s a side effect: autocompletion also becomes case insensitive.
    </p>
<p id="N1B988" class="calibre4">
      In the “She sells sea shells” example above, the word “She” is not included in the word list because it starts with an uppercase “S.” However, if the <code class="cf1">‘ignorecase’</code> option were enabled, then “She” would appear in the word list with an uppercase “S.” Seeing as we’ve already typed a lowercase “s,” this might be considered unhelpful.
    </p>
<p id="N1B98E" class="calibre4">
      We can fix this behavior by enabling the <code class="cf1">‘infercase’</code> option (see <strong xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" class="calibre10">'infercase'</strong>
<a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'infercase'">
<img alt="info" src="images/information.png" class="calibre21"/>​</a>). This would add “she” to the word list but with a lowercase “s.”

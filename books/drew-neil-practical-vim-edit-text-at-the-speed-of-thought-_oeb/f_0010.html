    In <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span>, I demonstrate by showing examples rather than by describing them. That’s not easy to do with the written word. To show the steps taken during an interactive editing session, I’ve adopted a simple notation that illustrates the keystrokes and the contents of a Vim buffer side by side.

    If you’re keen to jump to the action, you can safely skip this chapter for now. It describes each of the conventions used throughout <span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span>, many of which you’ll find to be self-explanatory. At some point, you’ll probably come across a symbol and wonder what it stands for. When that happens, turn back and consult this chapter for the answer.

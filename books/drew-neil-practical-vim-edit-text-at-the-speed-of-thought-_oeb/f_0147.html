    Vim’s search command is great for finding all occurrences of a pattern within a file. But what if we want to find matches across an entire project? Then we have to scan many files. Traditionally, this has been the domain of <code class="cf">grep</code>, a dedicated Unix tool.

<p id="N1B51D" class="calibre4">
    In this chapter, we’ll discover Vim’s <code class="cf">:grep</code> command, which allows us to call an external program without leaving our editor. While this command calls <code class="cf">grep</code> by default (when available), we’ll see that it can easily be customized to outsource the task to other dedicated programs, such as <code class="cf">ack</code>.

    One down side to using external programs is that their regex syntax may be incompatible with the one we use for most Vim searches. We’ll see that the <code class="cf">:vimgrep</code> command allows us to use Vim’s native search engine to find patterns in multiple files. This convenience comes at a cost: <code class="cf">vimgrep</code> isn’t nearly as fast as dedicated programs.

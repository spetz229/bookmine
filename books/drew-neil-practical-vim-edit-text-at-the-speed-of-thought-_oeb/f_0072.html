    Vim provides many ways of moving around within a document as well as commands for jumping between buffers. In this chapter we’ll focus on motions, which allow us to move around within a document.
  </p>
<p id="N14A03" class="calibre4">
    Perhaps the simplest way of moving around is using the cursor keys. Vim allows us to navigate up, down, left, and right without moving our hands from the home row, as we’ll see in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0073.html#sec.hjkl">Tip 46</a>.
    That’s a start, but there are quicker ways of moving around:
    <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0075.html#sec.words.and.words">Tip 48</a>, shows how to move a word at a time;
    <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0076.html#sec.fchar">Tip 49</a>, shows how to move with precision to any character within the current line;
    and <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0077.html#sec.search.motion">Tip 50</a>, shows how to use the search command for getting around.
  </p>
<p id="N14A1B" class="calibre4">
    Motions are not just for navigating around a document. They can also be used in Operator-Pending mode to perform real work, as discussed in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0031.html#sec.operator">Tip 12</a>.
    Throughout this chapter, we’ll study examples of how motions can be used in combination with operator commands.
    The stars of Operator-Pending mode are text objects, which we’ll cover in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0078.html#sec.text.objects">Tip 51</a>, and <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0079.html#sec.daw.ciw">Tip 52</a>.
  </p>
<p id="N14A2A" class="calibre4">
    Vim has a vast number of motions.
    We can’t cover them all in this chapter, so I recommend that you look up the <strong xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" class="calibre10">motion.txt</strong>
<a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html">
<img alt="info" src="images/information.png" class="calibre21"/>​</a> section of Vim’s documentation for a complete reference. Set yourself the goal of adding a couple of motions to your repertoire each week.

          “Do one thing, and do it well” is a principle of Unix philosophy. Vim provides wrapper commands that make it easy to call external programs such as <code class="cf">make</code> or <code class="cf">grep</code>. Some tasks require deeper integration with the text editor, so Vim provides native tools for spell checking and autocompletion and also provides a built-in <code class="cf">:vimgrep</code> command. In this part of the book we’ll study Vim’s toolbox and its interface for working with external tools.

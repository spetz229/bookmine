    Our work is repetitive by nature. Whether we’re making the same small change in several places or moving around between similar regions of a document, we repeat many actions. Anything that can streamline a repetitive workflow will save our time multifold.

    Vim is optimized for repetition. Its efficiency stems from the way it tracks our most recent actions. We can always replay the last change with a single keystroke. Powerful as this sounds, it’s useless unless we learn to craft our actions so that they perform a useful unit of work when replayed. Mastering this concept is the key to becoming effective with Vim.

    The dot command is our starting point. This seemingly simple command is the most versatile tool in the box, and understanding it is the first step toward Vim mastery. We’ll work through a handful of simple editing tasks that can be rapidly completed with the dot command. Although each task looks quite different from the next, their solutions almost converge. We’ll identify an ideal editing formula, which requires only one keystroke to move and another to execute.

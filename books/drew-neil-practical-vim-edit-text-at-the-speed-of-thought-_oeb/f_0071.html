          Motions are some of the most important commands for operating Vim. Not only do they let us move our cursor around, but when used in Operator-Pending mode, they also allow us to specify the range of text on which an operation will act. We’ll meet some of the most useful motions in this part of the book. We’ll also learn about Vim’s jump commands, which allow us to quickly navigate between files.

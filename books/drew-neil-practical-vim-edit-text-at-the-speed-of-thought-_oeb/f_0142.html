    Vim’s quickfix list is a core feature that allows us to integrate external tools into our workflow. At its simplest, it maintains a sequence of annotated addresses comprising the filename, line number, column number (optional), and a message. Traditionally, these addresses would be a list of error messages generated by a compiler, but they could just as well be warnings from a syntax checker, linter, or any other tool that emits such output.

    We’ll start off by looking at an example workflow: running <code class="cf">make</code> in an external shell and navigating to error messages by hand. Then we’ll introduce the <code class="cf">:make</code> command, seeing how it can streamline our workflow by parsing error messages from the compiler and making them navigable in the form of the quickfix list.

Then in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0145.html#sec.colder">Tip 106</a>, we’ll learn that the quickfix feature has its own form of the undo command.

    In <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="f_0146.html#sec.makeprg">Tip 107</a>, we’ll walk through the steps required to configure Vim so that calling <code class="cf">:make</code> puts the contents of a JavaScript file through JSLint, generating a navigable quickfix list from the output.

<p id="N15DBE" class="calibre4">
  As we learned in the previous chapter, motions allow us to move around within a file. Jumps are similar, except that they can also move us between different files. Vim provides a couple of commands that turn keywords in the document into a wormhole, allowing us to jump quickly from one part of our codebase to another. That might seem disorienting at first, but Vim always traces our path by leaving a trail that we can easily follow to get back to where we came from.

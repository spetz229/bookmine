<p id="N1C2CC" class="calibre4">
      Keep working at it. With practice, things that once seemed tricky will become second nature. Make it your goal to operate Vim without having to think about what you’re doing. When you reach that level, you’ll be able to edit text at the speed of thought.

<span class="calibre5">Practical Vim</span> doesn’t intend to provide a linear reading experience, so you won’t have taken everything in on your first pass. Some of the tips are basic, while others speak to the advanced user. I expect that you’ll be able to pick up this book again and learn something new.

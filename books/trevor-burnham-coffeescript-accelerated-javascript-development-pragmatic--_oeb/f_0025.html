<p id="N11785" class="calibre5">
      It’s safe to say that you now know more about CoffeeScript than 99.999 percent of the Earth’s population. You’ve learned how to define, call, and return values from functions. You’ve also learned that functions create scope, and that the context variable <code class="cf">this</code> is a fickle creature that depends on how the function is called—unless the function is bound to the context it’s defined in by being defined with <code class="cf">=&gt;</code>.
    </p>
<p id="N1178E" class="calibre5">
      You’ve also sampled a smorgasbord of CoffeeScript’s other features: <code class="cf">if/unless</code>, <code class="cf">try...catch</code>, default argument values, and property arguments among them. Then we used those features to write a simple command-line app that runs on Node.js.
    </p>

      There are only two areas of CoffeeScript that we haven’t touched yet: collections (objects and arrays) and iteration (loops). By a happy coincidence, those are the subject of the next chapter.
    </p>
<p id="N1179A" class="calibre5">
      But before we go on, test your knowledge with the following exercises. You weren’t thinking of skipping them, were you? Trust me: they’ll save you from pain in the future.

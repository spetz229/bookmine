    In the last chapter, we mastered functions. Now it’s time to start applying those functions to collections of data.
  </p>
<p id="N11859" class="calibre5">
    We’ll start by looking at objects in a new light as all-purpose storage. Then we’ll learn about arrays, which give us a more ordered place to save our bits. From there, we’ll segue into loops, the lingua franca of iteration. We’ll also learn about building arrays directly from loops using comprehensions and about extracting parts of arrays using pattern matching. Finally, we’ll complete the command-line version of 5x5 that we started in the last chapter and recap what we’ve learned with a fresh batch of exercises.

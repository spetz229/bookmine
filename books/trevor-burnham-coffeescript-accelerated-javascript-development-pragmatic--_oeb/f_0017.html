    The heart and soul of CoffeeScript consists of two characters: <code class="cf">-&gt;</code>. That’s all it takes to define a new function, but don’t let the terseness fool you; as we’ll soon see, functions are powerful, versatile objects. Mastering them is the first step to mastering CoffeeScript.
  </p>
<p id="N1089B" class="calibre5">
    While functions are the major players of this chapter, we’ll meet a cheerful supporting cast along the way: variables, strings, conditionals, exceptions, and everything else you need to write useful functions. We’ll also have a refresher on two crucial concepts, scope and context, and show how they carry over to CoffeeScript. Then we’ll conclude our tour by looking at some very cool features: property arguments, default arguments, and splats.
  </p>
<p id="N1089E" class="calibre5">
    At this point we’ll be ready to tackle our first project, in which we’ll put together an input prompt for our little word game. And last but not least, this chapter’s exercises will push your newfound CoffeeScript expertise to its limits.

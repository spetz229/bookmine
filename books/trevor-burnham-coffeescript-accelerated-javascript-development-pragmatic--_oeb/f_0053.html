    Running JavaScript on the server has long been a dream of web developers. Rather than switching back and forth between a client-side language and a server-side language, a developer using a JavaScript-powered server would only need to be fluent in that lingua franca of web apps—or in its twenty-first-century offshoot, CoffeeScript.

    Now that dream is finally a reality. In this chapter, we’ll take a brief tour of Node.js, starting with its module pattern (part of the CommonJS specification). Then we’ll figure out just what an “evented architecture” is, with its implications for both server performance and our sanity. Finally, we’ll add a Node back end to our 5x5 project from the last chapter, with real-time multiplayer support powered by WebSocket.

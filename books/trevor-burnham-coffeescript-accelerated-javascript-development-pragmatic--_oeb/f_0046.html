<h2 id="sec.whyJQuery" class="calibre13">5.1 The Tao of jQuery</h2>
<p id="N1328E" class="calibre5">
		    Each JavaScript library has its own particular philosophy, and jQuery’s is a natural fit for JavaScript (and CoffeeScript, too!).
		  </p>
<p id="N13291" class="calibre5">
		    jQuery doesn’t modify JavaScript’s built-in object prototypes, such as <code class="cf">String</code> and <code class="cf">Array</code>. That’s the fundamental difference between jQuery and Prototype, the second-most popular JavaScript library. Prototype can do some amazing things, but using it means potentially breaking any code that wasn’t written with Prototype in mind. For instance, a library might use <code class="cf">for x of arr</code> to iterate over an array’s indices, not realizing that this will also include the properties of <code class="cf">Array.prototype</code> added by Prototype.js. (It’s partly for this reason that <code class="cf">for...in</code> is preferred to <code class="cf">for...of</code> for array iteration. <code class="cf">for own...of</code> would also work in this case, because it skips properties that fail the <code class="cf">hasOwnProperty</code> test.)
		  </p>
<p id="N132AF" class="calibre5">
		    Instead, jQuery’s power is safely tucked away in one object, <code class="cf">jQuery</code>, which is normally aliased as <code class="cf">$</code>. We’ll use the <code class="cf">$</code> alias throughout this book, but be aware that it’s possible to disable it, in case another library wants to use that variable name.<a id="FNPTR-38" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-38">[38]</a>
</p>
<p id="N132C0" class="calibre5">
		    The jQuery object lets you do everything from animating transitions to adding event callbacks to pulling data from the server. And that’s without even drawing on the thousands of free plugins available.<a id="FNPTR-39" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-39">[39]</a> Of course, this chapter and the next are too brief to show you everything jQuery is capable of, but it should give you enough of an understanding to avoid common pitfalls while exploring jQuery’s vast capabilities, which are exquisitely documented at <a href="http://api.jquery.com">http://api.jquery.com</a>.

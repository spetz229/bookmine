<h2 class="calibre13">A2.3 CoffeeScript on Rails</h2>
<p id="N148FE" class="calibre5">
      CoffeeScript owes a lot to Ruby. Its first compiler was written in Ruby; many of its earliest users were also Rubyists; and now the language enjoys the support of the preeminent Rubyists at 37signals. In April 2011, it was announced that CoffeeScript support will be included in Rails 3.1 via Sprockets 2. As of this writing, neither has been released, but you can check out the latest Sprockets at <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets</a>.

      Earlier versions of Rails can still enjoy first-class CoffeeScript integration, thanks to a plugin called Barista:<a id="FNPTR-54" href="f_0073.html#FOOTNOTE-54">[54]</a> you put your <code class="cf">coffee</code> files in one directory, and the corresponding <code class="cf">js</code> files are automatically generated as needed on each page request. You can also embed CoffeeScript in ERB and Haml templates.
    </p>

      Barista goes even further by allowing you to package and pull in CoffeeScript from gems. This is a terrific way to split large projects into reusable, cleanly versioned components. Plus, it’s 100 percent Heroku-compatible; just plug in therubyracer-heroku, a JavaScript interpreter designed to run in any Ruby environment.<a id="FNPTR-55" href="f_0073.html#FOOTNOTE-55">[55]</a> (The same applies to Rails 3.1 apps; both Barista and Rails 3.1 employ the same gem to wrap around the CoffeeScript compiler.)<a id="FNPTR-56" href="f_0073.html#FOOTNOTE-56">[56]</a>
</p>
<p id="N14938" class="calibre5">
      One bummer with Barista (and most other web framework integrations for CoffeeScript) is that if there’s a syntax error in your code, you won’t find out about it until you refresh the page and get broken JavaScript. To help with this, I wrote a plugin that extends Barista to provide a Growl notification whenever your CoffeeScript fails to compile.<a id="FNPTR-57" href="f_0073.html#FOOTNOTE-57">[57]</a>

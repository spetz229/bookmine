<p id="N13168" class="calibre5">
      In this chapter, we’ve learned about two ways that CoffeeScript supports modular programs: First, individual files (“modules”) are isolated from each other, except when variables are explicitly exported. And second, functions and data can be combined into classes.
    </p>
<p id="N1316B" class="calibre5">
      We applied both techniques to clean up our quick-and-dirty version of 5x5 from the last chapter. The result? Not only is the code more readable, but it’s also much easier to refactor, as we’ll see in the next chapter when we transform our old-school text-based program into a newfangled web app. And we’ll do it with a little help from JavaScript’s good pal, jQuery.

<p id="N13A07" class="calibre5">
      In this chapter, we’ve touched on all the basics of jQuery, the closest thing JavaScript has to a standard library for working with web pages. You’ve learned to grab elements with selectors, manipulate their CSS styles and HTML attributes, and attach events. The prospect of building an interactive web page from scratch should no longer cause you to break out in a cold sweat.
    </p>
<p id="N13A0A" class="calibre5">
      One major topic we haven’t addressed is Ajax. jQuery makes communicating with the server a breeze. You can find the relevant docs at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/">http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/</a>.
    </p>
<p id="N13A13" class="calibre5">
      There’s something else worth mentioning. Thanks to Node.js, jQuery can now be run easily on the server. How? Through a library called jsdom, which provides a simulated browser environment within Node.<a id="FNPTR-43" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-43">[43]</a> One fantastic use case for jsdom and jQuery is templating. Why bother writing server-side templates (such as ERB files in Ruby on Rails) when you can just take raw HTML and manipulate it on the server with jQuery before serving it? That way, you can serve an initial version of the page that makes sense (great for search engines and screen readers) and then reuse the same code on the client side to add dynamic content.
    </p>
<p id="N13A24" class="calibre5">
      I encourage you to play with Ajax and jsdom on your own. In the next chapter, we’ll take a different approach: we’ll use WebSocket (through a library called Socket.io) to enable two-way asynchronous communication between the client and the server. And we’ll get to know Node.js a little better while we’re at it, using it to host the multiplayer version of 5x5.

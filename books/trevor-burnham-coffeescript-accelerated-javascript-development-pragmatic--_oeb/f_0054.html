<h2 id="sec.whatIsNode" class="calibre13">6.1 What Is Node.js?</h2>
<p id="N13ADE" class="calibre5">
      Ignore the name: Node.js isn’t a JavaScript library. Instead, Node.js is a JavaScript <span class="emph">interpreter</span> (powered by V8, the engine used by Google’s Chrome browser) that interfaces with the underlying operating system. That way, JavaScript run by Node.js can read and write files, spawn processes, and—most enticingly—send and receive HTTP requests.
    </p>
<p id="N13AED" class="calibre5">
      Like CoffeeScript, Node is a new project (dating to early 2009) that’s taken off rapidly and attracted all kinds of excitement. Witness the Node.js Knockout, a Rails Rumble-inspired competition to develop the best Node app in forty-eight hours.<a id="FNPTR-44" href="f_0059.html#FOOTNOTE-44">[44]</a>

      A number of awesome projects have already been written with Node and CoffeeScript. The following is a small, select sampling. You might want to come back to this list after you’ve completed the book; reading real-world code is a great way to take your mastery to the next level:

<em class="emph">Docco</em> [Ash11]: Uber-computer scientist Donald Knuth advocated “literate programming,” in which code and comments are written so that someone encountering the program for the first time can understand it just by reading it once. Docco, written by Jeremy Ashkenas, supports this methodology by generating beautiful web pages in which comments and code are displayed side-by-side.
        </p>

<p id="N13B05" class="calibre5">
<em class="emph">Eco</em> [Ste11]: Say you’re writing a Node-based web application. You have all of these HTML skeletons and a mess of application code, but you’re not sure how to combine the two. Eco lets you embed CoffeeScript <span class="emph">within</span> your markup, turning it into a server-side templating language.
        </p>
</li>
<li class="calibre3">
<p id="N13B12" class="calibre5">
<em class="emph">Zappa</em> [NM11]: Creating web applications from scratch has never been simpler. Zappa is a layer on top of Node’s popular Express framework that lets you succinctly define how your web server should respond to arbitrary HTTP requests.<a id="FNPTR-45" href="f_0059.html#FOOTNOTE-45">[45]</a> Works great with Eco, too!
        </p>

<p id="N13B22" class="calibre5">
<em class="emph">Zombie.js</em> [Ark11]: There’s a new kid on the full-stack web app testing block: Zombie.js. Zombie lets you validate your application’s behavior with the power of Sizzle, the same selection engine that powers jQuery. Not only is it easy to use, it’s also insanely fast.

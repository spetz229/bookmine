    Once upon a time, programmers wrote web applications in pure JavaScript, unencumbered by heavy frameworks. Adventurous programmers roamed these fertile lands, devising exciting new functionality for their apps. But all was not well, for every bold feat performed by these dynamic knights had to be done twice (at least): once in Netscape (and its open-source descendants) and once in Internet Explorer.

  To alleviate this burden, programmers began to write functions that allowed them to avoid repetition in their code. These functions became ever more numerous and complex, fusing into libraries made up of thousands of lines of code. Soon, warring factions began to form around them. Among these were MooTools, Prototype, Dojo, and YUI.

  But as the years passed, one library became so popular as to become the de facto standard: jQuery.<a id="FNPTR-35" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-35">[35]</a> Initially released by the then twenty-two-year-old John Resig in 2006, jQuery is now used by nearly one-third of the ten thousand most-visited websites,<a id="FNPTR-36" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-36">[36]</a> and Resig has become one of the world’s most famous programmers. Recent spin-offs, including jQuery Mobile, have brought jQuery’s familiar syntax far beyond the desktop-oriented web.<a id="FNPTR-37" href="f_0052.html#FOOTNOTE-37">[37]</a>Although other libraries are still widely used, jQuery truly stands apart.

	 In this chapter, we’ll go through the basics of using jQuery to manipulate the elements of a web page and respond to events. (If you’re familiar with jQuery on JavaScript, this will just be a review with minor syntactic adjustments.) At the end of the chapter, we’ll use these newfound superpowers to turn our quaint little word game into a full-fledged browser-based app.

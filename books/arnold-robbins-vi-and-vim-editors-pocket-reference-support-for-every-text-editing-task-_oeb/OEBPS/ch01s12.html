    open source license.</p><p class="copyright">This code does not compile “out of the box” on modern systems, and
    porting it is difficult. Fortunately, the work has <span>already</span> been done. If you would like to use
    the original, “real” <em class="calibre3">vi</em>, you can download the source
    code and build it yourself. See <a href="http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/">http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/</a> for more information.</p></div></div>

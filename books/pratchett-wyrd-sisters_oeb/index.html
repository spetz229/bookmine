        <div class="paragraph">
          <span>Kingdoms wobble, crowns topple and knives flash on the magical Discworld as the statutory three witches meddle in royal politics. But Granny Weatherwax (of <strong class="calibre3">Equal Rites</strong>) and her fellow coven members find it's all a lot more difficult than playwrights would have you believe... </span>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <span>Everything you'd expect is here - hunchbacked kings, lost crowns and disguised heirs. And they are joined by things you haven't heard of yet, like a stage-struck thunderstorm and the first recorded instance of the in-flight refuelling of a broomstick. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <span>Through it all the wyrd sisters ("This cauldron's got all 'yuk' in it!") battle against frightful odds to put the rightful king on the throne. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <span>At least, that's what they think... </span>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <span>"Wyrd Sisters" is the sixth of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, which are now well-established as the funniest fantasy series ever - and among the funniest novels of any kind currently being published.</span>

    </h1>
    <div id="TOC_id36214909" class="calibre1"></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <em class="calibre10">(<span>Starring Three Witches, also kings, daggers, crowns, storms, dwarfs, cats, ghosts, spectres, apes, bandits, demons, forests, heirs, jesters, tortures, trolls, turntables, general rejoicing and drivers alarums.)</span></em>
        </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The wind howled. Lightning stabbed at the earth erratically, like an inefficient assassin. Thunder rolled back and forth across the dark, rain-lashed hills.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The night was as black as the inside of a cat. It was the kind of night, you could believe, on which gods moved men as though they were pawns on the chessboard of fate. In the middle of this elemental storm a fire gleamed among the dripping furze bushes like the madness in a weasel's eye. It illuminated three hunched figures. As the cauldron bubbled an eldritch voice shrieked: 'When shall we three meet again?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a pause.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Finally another voice said, in far more ordinary tones: 'Well, I can do next Tuesday.'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Through the fathomless deeps of space swims the star turtle Great A'Tuin, bearing on its back the four giant elephants who carry on their shoulders the mass of the Discworld. A tiny sun and moon spin around them, on a complicated orbit to induce seasons, so probably nowhere else in the multiverse is it sometimes necessary for an elephant to cock a leg to allow the sun to go past.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Exactly why this should be may never be known. Possibly the Creator of the universe got bored with all the usual business of axial inclination, albedos and rotational velocities, and decided to have a bit of fun for once.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It would be a pretty good bet that the gods of a world like this probably do not play chess and indeed this is the case. In fact no gods anywhere play chess. They haven't got the imagination. Gods prefer simple, vicious games, where you Do Not Achieve Transcendence but Go Straight To Oblivion; a key to the understanding of all religion is that a god's idea of amusement is Snakes and Ladders with greased rungs.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magic glues the Discworld together – magic generated by the turning of the world itself, magic wound like silk out of the underlying structure of existence to suture the wounds of reality.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A lot of it ends up in the Ramtop Mountains, which stretch from the frozen lands near the Hub all the way, via a lengthy archipelago, to the warm seas which flow endlessly into space over the Rim.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Raw magic crackles invisibly from peak to peak and earths itself in the mountains. It is the Ramtops that supply the world with most of its witches and wizards. In the Ramtops the leaves on the trees move even when there is no breeze. Rocks go for a stroll of an evening.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even the land, at times, seems alive . . .</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At times, so does the sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The storm was really giving it everything it had. This was its big chance. It had spent years hanging around the provinces, putting in some useful work as a squall, building up experience, making contacts, occasionally leaping out on unsuspecting shepherds or blasting quite small oak trees. Now an opening in the weather had given it an opportunity to strut its hour, and it was building up its role in the hope of being spotted by one of the big climates.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a <em class="calibre10">good</em> storm. There was quite effective projection and passion there, and critics agreed that if it would only learn to control its thunder it would be, in years to come, a storm to watch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The woods roared their applause and were full of mists and flying leaves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On nights such as these the gods, as has already been pointed out, play games other than chess with the fates of mortals and the thrones of kings. It is important to remember that they always cheat, right up to the end . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And a coach came hurtling along the rough forest track, jerking violently as the wheels bounced off tree roots. The driver lashed at the team, the desperate crack of his whip providing a rather neat counterpoint to the crash of the tempest overhead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Behind – only a little way behind, and getting closer -were three hooded riders.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On nights such as this, evil deeds are done. And good deeds, of course. But mostly evil, on the whole.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On nights such as this, witches are abroad.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Well, not actually <em class="calibre10">abroad.</em> They don't like the food and you can't trust the water and the shamans always hog the deckchairs. But there was a full moon breasting the ragged clouds and the rushing air was full of whispers and the very broad hint of magic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In their clearing above the forest the witches spoke thus:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm babysitting on Tuesday,' said the one with no hat but a thatch of white curls so thick she might have been wearing a helmet. 'For our Jason's youngest. I can manage Friday. Hurry up with the tea, luv. I'm that parched.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The junior member of the trio gave a sigh, and ladled some boiling water out of the cauldron into the teapot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The third witch patted her hand in a kindly fashion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You said it quite well,' she said. 'Just a bit more work on the screeching. Ain't that right, Nanny Ogg?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very useful screeching, I thought,' said Nanny Ogg hurriedly. 'And I can see Goodie Whemper, maysherestinpeace, gave you a lot of help with the squint.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a good squint,' said Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The junior witch, whose name was Magrat Garlick, relaxed considerably. She held Granny Weatherwax in awe. It was known throughout the Ramtop Mountains that Mss Weatherwax did not approve of anything very much. If she said it was a good squint, then Magrat's eyes were probably staring up her own nostrils.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Unlike wizards, who like nothing better than a complicated hierarchy, witches don't go in much for the structured approach to career progression. It's up to each individual witch to take on a girl to hand the area over to when she dies. Witches are not by nature gregarious, at least with other witches, and they certainly don't have leaders.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax was the most highly-regarded of the leaders they didn't have.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat's hands shook slightly as they made the tea. Of course, it was all very gratifying, but it was a bit nerve-racking to start one's working life as village witch between Granny and, on the other side of the forest, Nanny Ogg. It'd been her idea to form a local coven. She felt it was more, well, occult. To her amazement the other two had agreed or, at least, hadn't disagreed much.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'An oven?' Nanny Ogg had said. 'What'd we want to join an oven for?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She means a coven, Gytha,' Granny Weatherwax had explained. 'You know, like in the old days. A meeting.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A knees up?' said Nanny Ogg hopefully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No dancing,' Granny had warned. 'I don't hold with dancing. Or singing or getting over-excited or all that messing about with ointments and similar.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Does you good to get out,' said Nanny happily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat had been disappointed about the dancing, and was relieved that she hadn't ventured one or two other ideas that had been on her mind. She fumbled in the packet she had brought with her. It was her first sabbat, and she was determined to do it right.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Would anyone care for a scone?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked hard at hers before she bit. Magrat had baked bat designs on it. They had little eyes made of currants.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The coach crashed through the trees at the forest edge, ran on two wheels for a few seconds as it hit a stone, righted itself against all the laws of balance, and rumbled on. But it was going slower now. The slope was dragging at it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The coachman, standing upright in the manner of a charioteer, pushed his hair out of his eyes and peered through the murk. No-one lived up here, in the lap of the Ramtops themselves, but there was a light ahead. By all that was merciful, there was a light there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>An arrow buried itself in the coach roof behind him.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Meanwhile King Verence, monarch of Lancre, was making a discovery.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Like most people – most people, at any rate, below the age of sixty or so – Verence hadn't exercised his mind much about what happened to you when you died. Like most people since the dawn of time, he assumed it all somehow worked out all right in the end.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And, like most people since the dawn of time, he was now dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was in fact lying at the bottom of one of his own stairways in Lancre Castle, with a dagger in his back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He sat up, and was surprised to find that while someone he was certainly inclined to think of as himself was sitting up, something very much like his body remained lying on the floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a pretty good body, incidentally, now he came to see it from outside for the first time. He had always been quite attached to it although, he had to admit, this did not now seem to be the case.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was big and well-muscled. He'd looked after it. He'd allowed it a moustache and long-flowing locks. He'd seen it got plenty of healthy outdoor exercise and lots of red meat. Now, just when a body would have been useful, it had let him down. Or out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On top of that, he had to come to terms with the tall, thin figure standing beside him. Most of it was hidden in a hooded black robe, but the one arm which extended from the folds to grip a large scythe was made of bone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When one is dead, there are things one instinctively recognises.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>HALLO.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence drew himself up to his full height, or what would have been his full height if that part of him to which the word 'height' could have been applied was not lying stiff on the floor and facing a future in which only the word 'depth' could be appropriate.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'I am a</span>
        </em>
        <span> king, mark you,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <em class="calibre10">
            <span>WAS,</span>
          </em>
        </span>
        <span>
          <span> YOUR MAJESTY.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' Verence barked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I SAID WAS. IT'S CALLED THE PAST TENSE. YOU'LL SOON GET USED TO IT.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The tall figure tapped its calcareous fingers on the scythe's handle. It was obviously upset about something.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>If it came to that, Verence thought, so am I. But the various broad hints available in his present circumstances were breaking through even the mad brave stupidity that made up most of his character, and it was dawning on him that whatever kingdom he might currently be in, he wasn't king of it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you Death, fellow?' he ventured.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I HAVE MANY NAMES.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Which one are you using at present?' said Verence, with a shade more deference. There were people milling around them; in fact, quite a few people were milling <em class="calibre10">through</em> them, like ghosts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, so it was Felmet,' the king added vaguely, looking at the figure lurking with obscene delight at the top of the stairs. 'My father said I should never let him get behind me. Why don't I feel angry?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>GLANDS,</span>
        </span>
        <span> said Death shortly. </span>
        <span>
          <span>ADRENALIN AND SO FORTH. AND EMOTIONS. YOU DON'T HAVE THEM. ALL YOU HAVE NOW IS THOUGHT.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The tall figure appeared to reach a decision.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>THIS IS VERY IRREGULAR,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he went on, apparently to himself. </span>
        <span>
          <span>HOWEVER, WHO AM I TO ARGUE?</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who indeed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>WHAT?</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, who indeed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>SHUT UP.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death stood with his skull on one side, as though listening to some inner voice. As his hood fell away the late king noticed that Death resembled a polished skeleton in every way but one. His eye sockets glowed sky blue. Verence wasn't frightened, however; not simply because it is difficult to be in fear of anything when the bits you need to be frightened <em class="calibre10">with</em> are curdling several yards away, but because he had never really been frightened of anything in his life, and wasn't going to start now. This was partly because he didn't have the imagination, but he was also one of those rare individuals who are totally focused in time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Most people aren't. They live their lives as a sort of temporal blur around the point where their body actually is – anticipating the future, or holding on to the past. They're usually so busy thinking about what happens next that the only time they ever find out what is happening now is when they come to look back on it. Most people are like this. They learn how to fear because they can actually tell, down at the subconscious level, what is going to happen next. It's already happening to them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But Verence had always lived only for the present. Until now, anyway.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I SUPPOSE NO-ONE MENTIONED ANYTHING TO YOU?</span>
        </span>
        <span> he hazarded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Say again?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>NO PREMONITIONS? STRANGE DREAMS? MAD OLD SOOTHSAYERS SHOUTING THINGS AT YOU IN THE STREET?</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'About what? Dying?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>NO, I SUPPOSE NOT. IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT,</span>
        </span>
        <span> said Death sourly. </span>
        <span>
          <span>THEY LEAVE IT ALL TO ME.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who do?' said Verence, mystified.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>FATE. DESTINY. ALL THE REST OF THEM.</span>
        </span>
        <span> Death laid a hand on the king's shoulder. </span>
        <span>
          <span>THE FACT IS, I'M AFRAID, YOU'RE DUE TO BECOME A GHOST.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh.' He looked down at his ... body, which seemed solid enough. Then someone walked through him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>DON'T LET IT UPSET YOU.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence watched his own stiff corpse being carried reverentially from the hall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll try,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>GOOD MAN.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't think I will be up to all that business with the white sheets and the chains, though,' he said. 'Do I have to walk around moaning and screaming?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death shrugged. </span>
        <span>
          <span>DO YOU WANT TO?</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>THEN I SHOULDN'T BOTHER, IF I WERE YOU.</span>
        </span>
        <span> Death pulled an hour-glass from the recesses of his dark robe and inspected it closely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>AND NOW I REALLY MUST BE GOING,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said. He turned on his heel, put his scythe over his shoulder and started to walk out of the hall through the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I say? Just hold on there!' shouted Verence, running after him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death didn't look back. Verence followed him through the wall; it was like walking through fog.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is that all?' he demanded. 'I mean, how long will I be a ghost? <em class="calibre10">Why</em> am I a ghost? You can't just leave me like this.' He halted and raised an imperious, slightly transparent finger. 'Stop! I command you!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death shook his head gloomily, and stepped through the next wall. The king hurried after him with as much dignity as he could still muster, and found Death fiddling with the girths of a large white horse standing on the battlements. It was wearing a nosebag.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can't leave me like this!' he repeated, in the face of the evidence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death turned to him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I CAN,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said. </span>
        <span>
          <span>YOU'RE UNDEAD, YOU SEE. GHOSTS INHABIT A WORLD BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD. IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY.</span>
        </span>
        <span> He patted the king on the shoulder. </span>
        <span>
          <span>DON'T WORRY,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said, </span>
        <span>
          <span>IT WON'T BE FOREVER.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>IT MAY <em class="calibre10">SEEM</em> LIKE FOREVER.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How long will it really be?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>UNTIL YOU HAVE FULFILLED YOUR DESTINY, I ASSUME.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And how will I know what my destiny is?' said the king, desperately.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>CAN'T HELP THERE. I'M SORRY.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, how can I find out?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>THESE THINGS GENERALLY BECOME APPARENT, I UNDERSTAND,</span>
        </span>
        <span> said Death, and swung himself into the saddle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And until then I have to haunt this place.' King Verence stared around at the draughty battlements. 'All alone, I suppose. Won't anyone be able to see me?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>OH, THE PSYCHICALLY INCLINED. CLOSE RELATIVES. AND CATS, OF COURSE.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I hate cats.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death's face became a little stiffer, if that were possible. The blue glow in his eye sockets flickered red for an instant.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I SEE,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said. The tone suggested that death was too good for cat-haters. </span>
        <span>
          <span>YOU LIKE GREAT BIG DOGS, I IMAGINE.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'As a matter of fact, I do.' The king stared gloomily at the dawn. His dogs. He'd really miss his dogs. And it looked like such a good hunting day.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wondered if ghosts hunted. Almost certainly not, he imagined. Or ate, or drank either for that matter, and that was really depressing. He liked a big noisy banquet and had quaffed</span>
        <span>
          <a href="#note_1" title="Quaffing is like drinking, but you spill more. "><sup class="calibre11">[1]</sup></a> many a pint of good ale. And bad ale, come to that. He'd never been able to tell the difference till the following morning, usually.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He kicked despondently at a stone, and noted gloomily that his foot went right through it. No hunting, drinking, carousing, no wassailing, no hawking . . . It was dawning on him that the pleasures of the flesh were pretty sparse without the flesh. Suddenly life wasn't worth living. The fact that he wasn't living it didn't cheer him up at all.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>SOME PEOPLE <em class="calibre10">LIKE</em> TO BE GHOSTS,</span>
        </span>
        <span> said Death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hmm?' said Verence, gloomily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>IT'S NOT SUCH A WRENCH, I ASSUME. THEY CAN SEE HOW THEIR DESCENDANTS GET ON. SORRY? IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But Verence had vanished into the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>DON'T MIND ME, WILL YOU,</span>
        </span>
        <span> said Death, peevishly. He looked around him with a gaze that could see through time and space and the souls of men, and noted a landslide in distant Klatch, a hurricane in Howandaland, a plague in Hergen.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>BUSY, BUSY,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he muttered, and spurred his horse into the sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence ran through the walls of his own castle. His feet barely touched the ground – in fact, the unevenness of the floor meant that at times they didn't touch the ground at all.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>As a king he was used to treating servants as if they were not there, and running through them as a ghost was almost the same. The only difference was that they didn't stand aside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence reached the nursery, saw the broken door, the trailed sheets . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Heard the hoofbeats. He reached the window, saw his own horse go full tilt through the open gateway in the shafts of the coach. A few seconds later three horsemen followed it. The sound of hooves echoed for a moment on the cobbles and died away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The king thumped the sill, his fist going several inches into the stone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then he pushed his way out into the air, disdaining to notice the drop, and half flew, half ran down across the courtyard and into the stables.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It took him a mere twenty seconds to learn that, to the great many things a ghost cannot do, should be added the mounting of a horse. He did succeed in getting into the saddle, or at least in straddling the air just above it, but when the horse finally bolted, terrified beyond belief by the mysterious things happening behind its ears, Verence was left sitting astride five feet of fresh air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He tried to run, and got about as far as the gateway before the air around him thickened to the consistency of tar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can't,' said a sad, old voice behind him. 'You have to stay where you were killed. That's what haunting means. Take it from me. I know.'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax paused with a second scone halfway to her mouth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Something comes,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can you tell by the pricking of your thumbs?' said Magrat earnestly. Magrat had learned a lot about witchcraft from books.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The pricking of my ears,' said Granny. She raised her eyebrows at Nanny Ogg. Old Goodie Whemper had been an excellent witch in her way, but far too <em class="calibre10">fanciful.</em> Too many flowers and romantic notions and such.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The occasional flash of lightning showed the moorland stretching down to the forest, but the rain on the warm summer earth had filled the air with mist wraiths.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hoofbeats?' said Nanny Ogg. 'No-one would come up here this time of night.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat peered around timidly. Here and there on the moor were huge standing stones, their origins lost in time, which were said to lead mobile and private lives of their own. She shivered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's to be afraid of?' she managed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Us,' said Granny Weatherwax, smugly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The hoofbeats neared, slowed. And then the coach rattled between the furze bushes, its horses hanging in their harnesses. The driver leapt down, ran around to the door, pulled a large bundle from inside and dashed towards the trio.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was halfway across the damp peat when he stopped and stared at Granny Weatherwax with a look of horror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's all right,' she whispered, and the whisper cut through the grumbling of the storm as clearly as a bell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She took a few steps forward and a convenient lightning flash allowed her to look directly into the man's eyes. They had the peculiarity of focus that told those who had the Know that he was no longer looking at anything in this world.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>With a final jerking movement he thrust the bundle into Granny's arms and toppled forward, the feathers of a crossbow bolt sticking out of his back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Three figures moved into the firelight. Granny looked up into another pair of eyes, which were as chilly as the slopes of Hell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Their owner threw his crossbow aside. There was a glimpse of chain mail under his sodden cloak as he drew his sword.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He didn't flourish it. The eyes that didn't leave Granny's face weren't the eyes of one who bothers about flourishing things. They were the eyes of one who knows exactly what swords are for. He reached out his hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You will give it to me,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny twitched aside the blanket in her arms and looked down at a small face, wrapped in sleep.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' she said, on general principles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The soldier glanced from her to Magrat and Nanny Ogg, who were as still as the standing stones of the moor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You are witches?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded. Lightning skewered down from the sky and a bush a hundred yards away blossomed into fire. The two soldiers behind the man muttered something, but he smiled and raised a mailed hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Does the skin of witches turn aside steel?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not that I'm aware,' said Granny, levelly. 'You could give it a try.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>One of the soldiers stepped forward and touched the man's arm gingerly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir, with respect, sir, it's not a good idea—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Be silent.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But it's terrible bad luck to—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Must I ask you again?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir,' said the man. His eyes caught Granny's for a moment, and reflected hopeless terror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The leader grinned at Granny, who hadn't moved a muscle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your peasant magic is for fools, mother of the night. I can strike you down where you stand.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then strike, man,' said Granny, looking over his shoulder. 'If your heart tells you, strike as hard as you dare.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The man raised his sword. Lightning speared down again and split a stone a few yards away, filling the air with smoke and the stink of burnt silicon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Missed,' he said smugly, and Granny saw his muscles tense as he prepared to bring the sword down.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A look of extreme puzzlement crossed his face. He tilted his head sideways and opened his mouth, as if trying to come to terms with a new idea. His sword dropped out of his hand and landed point downwards in the peat. Then he gave a sigh and folded up, very gently, collapsing in a heap at Granny's feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She gave him a gentle prod with her toe. 'Perhaps you weren't aware of what I was aiming at,' she whispered. 'Mother of the night, indeed!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The soldier who had tried to restrain the man stared in horror at the bloody dagger in his hand, and backed away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I-I-I couldn't let. He shouldn't of. It's – it's not right to,' he stuttered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you from around these parts, young man?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He dropped to his knees. 'Mad Wolf, ma'am,' he said. He stared back at the fallen captain. 'They'll kill me now!' he wailed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you did what you thought was right,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't become a soldier for this. Not to go round killing people.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Exactly right. If I was you, I'd become a sailor,' said Granny thoughtfully. 'Yes, a nautical career. I should start as soon as possible. Now, in fact. Run off, man. Run off to sea where there are no tracks. You will have a long and successful life, I promise.' She looked thoughtful for a moment, and added, 'At least, longer than it's likely to be if you hang around here.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He pulled himself upward, gave her a look compounded of gratitude and awe, and ran off into the mist.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now perhaps someone will tell us what this is all about?' said Granny, turning to the third man.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>To where the third man had been.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was the distant drumming of hooves on the turf, and then silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg hobbled forward.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I could catch him,' she said. 'What do you think?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny shook her head. She sat down on a rock and looked at the child in her arms. It was a boy, no more than two years old, and quite naked under the blanket. She rocked him vaguely and stared at nothing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg examined the two corpses with the air of one for whom laying-out holds no fears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Perhaps they were bandits,' said Magrat tremulously.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny shook her head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A strange thing,' she said. 'They both wear this same badge. Two bears on a black and gold shield. Anyone know what that means?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's the badge of King Verence,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who's he?' said Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He rules this country,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. That king,' said Granny, as if the matter was hardly worth noting.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Soldiers fighting one another. Doesn't make sense,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Magrat, you have a look in the coach.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The youngest witch poked around inside the bodywork and came back with a sack. She upended it, and something thudded on to the turf.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The storm had rumbled off to the other side of the mountain now, and the watery moon shed a thin gruel of light over the damp moorland. It also gleamed off what was, without any doubt, an extremely important crown.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a crown,' said Magrat. 'It's got all spiky bits on it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, dear,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The child gurgled in its sleep. Granny Weatherwax didn't hold with looking at the future, but now she could feel the future looking at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She didn't like its expression at all.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>King Verence was looking at the past, and had formed pretty much the same view.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can see me?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes. Quite clearly, in fact,' said the newcomer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence's brows knotted. Being a ghost seemed to require considerably more mental effort than being alive; he'd managed quite well for forty years without having to think more than once or twice a day, and now he was doing it all me time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' he said. 'You're a ghost, too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well spotted.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was the head under your arm,' said Verence, pleased with himself. 'That gave me a clue.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Does it bother you? I can put it back on if it bothers you,' said the old ghost helpfully. He extended his free hand. 'Pleased to meet you. I'm Champot, King of Lancre.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Verence. Likewise.' He peered down at the old king's features and added, 'Don't seem to recall seeing your picture in the Long Gallery . . .'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, all that was after my time,' said Champot dismissively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How long have you been here, then?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Champot reached down and rubbed his nose. 'About a thousand years,' he said, his voice tinged with pride. 'Man and ghost.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A thousand years!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I built this place, in fact. Just got it nicely decorated when my nephew cut my head off while I was asleep. I can't tell you how much that upset me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But . . . a thousand years . . .' </span>Verence repeated, weakly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Champot took his arm. 'It's not that bad,' he confided, as he led the unresisting king across the courtyard. 'Better than being alive, in many ways.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They must be bloody strange ways, then!' snapped Verence. 'I <em class="calibre10">liked</em> being alive!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Champot grinned reassuringly. 'You'll soon get used to it,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't want to get used to it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've got a strong morphogenic field,' said Champot. 'I can tell. I look for these things. Yes. Very strong, I should say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was never very good with words, you know,' said Champot. 'I always found it easier to hit people with something. But I gather it all boils down to how alive you were. When you were alive, I mean. Something called—' he paused – 'animal vitality. Yes, that was it. Animal vitality. The more you had, the more you stay yourself, as it were, if you're a ghost. I expect you were one hundred per cent alive, when you were alive,' he added.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Despite himself, Verence felt flattered. 'I tried to keep myself busy,' he said. They had strolled through the wall into the Great Hall, which was now empty. The sight of the trestle tables triggered an automatic reaction in the king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How do we go about getting breakfast?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Champot's head looked surprised.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We don't,' he said. 'We're ghosts.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I'm hungry!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're not, you know. It's just your imagination.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a clattering from the kitchens. The cooks were already up and, in the absence of any other instructions, were preparing the castle's normal breakfast menu. Familiar smells were wafting up from the dark archway that led to the kitchens.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence sniffed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sausages,' he said dreamily. </span>'Bacon. Eggs. Smoked fish.' He stared at Champot. <span>'Black pudding,' he whispered.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You haven't actually got a stomach,' the old ghost pointed out. 'It's all in the mind. Just force of habit. You just <em class="calibre10">think</em> you're hungry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">think</em> I'm ravenous.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but you can't actually touch anything, you see,' Champot explained gently. 'Nothing at all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence lowered himself gently on to a bench, so that he did not drift through it, and sank his head in his hands. He'd heard that death could be bad. He just hadn't realised how bad.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wanted revenge. He wanted to get out of this suddenly horrible castle, to find his son. But he was even more terrified to find that what he really wanted, right now, was a plate of kidneys.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A damp dawn flooded across the landscape, scaled the battlements of Lancre Castle, stormed the keep and finally made it through the casement of the solar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Duke Felmet stared out gloomily at the dripping forest. There was such a lot of it. It wasn't, he decided, that he had anything against trees as such, it was just that the sight of so much of them was terribly depressing. He kept wanting to count them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Indeed, my love,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke put those who met him in mind of some sort of lizard, possibly the type that lives on volcanic islands, moves once a day, has a vestigial third eye and blinks on a monthly basis. He considered himself to be a civilised man more suited to the dry air and bright sun of a properly-organised climate.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On the other hand, he mused, it might be nice to be a tree. Trees didn't have ears, he was pretty sure of this. And they seemed to manage without the blessed state of matrimony. A male oak tree – he'd have to look this up – a male oak tree just shed its pollen on the breeze and all the business with the acorns, unless it was oak apples, no, he was pretty sure it was acorns, took place somewhere else . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, my precious,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Yes, trees had got it all worked out. Duke Felmet glared at the forest roof. Selfish bastards.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly, my dear,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke hesitated, desperately trying to replay the monologue of the last five minutes. There had been something about him being half a man, and . . . infirm on purpose? And he was sure there had been a complaint about the coldness of the castle. Yes, that was probably it. Well, those wretched trees could do a decent day's work for once.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll have some cut down and brought in directly, my cherished,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lady Felmet was momentarily speechless. This was by way of being a calendar event. She was a large and impressive woman, who gave people confronting her for the first time the impression that they were seeing a galleon under full sail; the effect was heightened by her unfortunate belief that red velvet rather suited her. However, it didn't set off her complexion. It matched it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke often mused on his good luck in marrying her. If it wasn't for the engine of her ambition he'd be just another local lord, with nothing much to do but hunt, drink and exercise his <em class="calibre10">droit de seigneur</em><a href="#note_2" title="Whatever that was. He'd never found anyone prepared to explain it to him. But it was definitely something a feudal lord ought to have and, he was pretty sure, it needed regular exercise. He imagined it was some kind of large hairy dog. He was definitely going to get one, and damn well exercise it."><sup class="calibre11">[2]</sup></a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Instead, he was now just a step away from the throne, and might soon be monarch of all he surveyed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Provided that all he surveyed was trees. He sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cut <em class="calibre10">what</em> down?' said Lady Felmet, icily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, the trees,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What have trees got to do with it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well. . . there are such a <em class="calibre10">lot</em> of them,' said the duke, with feeling.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't change the subject!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry, my sweet.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What I <em class="calibre10">said</em> was, how could you have been so stupid as to let them get away? I told you that servant was far too loyal. You can't trust someone like that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, my love.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You didn't by any chance consider sending someone after them, I suppose?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bentzen, my dear. And a couple of guards.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh.' The duchess paused. Bentzen, as captain of the duke's personal bodyguard, was as efficient a killer as a psychotic mongoose. He would have been her choice. It annoyed her to be temporarily deprived of a chance to fault her husband, but she rallied quite well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He wouldn't have needed to go out at all, if only you'd listened to me. But you never do.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do what, my passion?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke yawned. It had been a long night. There had been a thunderstorm of quite unnecessarily dramatic proportions, and then there had been all that messy business with the knives.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It has already been mentioned that Duke Felmet was one step away from the throne. The step in question was at the top of the flight leading to the Great Hall, down which King Verence had tumbled in the dark only to land, against all the laws of probability, on his own dagger.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had, however, been declared by his own physician to be a case of natural causes. Bentzen had gone to see the man and explained that falling down a flight of steps with a dagger in your back was a disease caused by unwise opening of the mouth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact it had already been caught by several members of the king's own bodyguard who had been a little bit hard of hearing. There had been a minor epidemic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke shuddered. There were details about last night that were both hazy and horrible.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He tried to reassure himself that all the unpleasantness was over now, and he had a kingdom. It wasn't much of one, apparently being mainly trees, but it was a kingdom and it had a crown.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>If only they could find it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lancre</span>
        <span> Castle</span>
        <span> was built on an outcrop of rock by an architect who had heard about Gormenghast but hadn't got the budget. He'd done his best, though, with a tiny confection of cut-price turrets, bargain basements, buttresses, crenellations, gargoyles, towers, courtyards, keeps and dungeons; in fact, just about everything a castle needs except maybe reasonable foundations and the kind of mortar that doesn't wash away in a light shower.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The castle leaned vertiginously over the racing white water of the Lancre river, which boomed darkly a thousand feet below. Every now and again a few bits fell in.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Small as it was, though, the castle contained a thousand places to hide a crown.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess swept out to find someone else to berate, and left Lord Felmet looking gloomily at the landscape. It started to rain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was on this cue that there came a thunderous knocking at the castle door. It seriously disturbed the castle porter, who was playing Cripple Mister Onion with the castle cook and the castle's Fool in the warmth of the kitchen.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He growled and stood up. 'There is a knocking without,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Without what?' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Without the door, idiot.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool gave him a worried look. 'A knocking without a door?' he said suspiciously. 'This isn't some kind of Zen, is it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When the porter had grumbled off in the direction of the gatehouse the cook pushed another farthing into the kitty and looked sharply over his cards at the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's a Zen?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool's bells tinkled as he sorted through his cards. Without thinking, he said: 'Oh, a sub-sect of the Turnwise Klatch philosophical system of Sumtin, noted for its simple austerity and the offer of personal tranquillity and wholeness achieved through meditation and breathing techniques; an interesting aspect is the asking of apparently nonsensical questions in order to widen the doors of perception.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How's that again?' said the cook suspiciously. He was on edge. When he'd taken the breakfast up to the Great Hall he'd kept getting the feeling that something was trying to take the tray out of his hands. And as if that wasn't bad enough, this new duke had sent him back for . . . </span>He shuddered. <span>Oatmeal! And a runny boiled egg! The cook was too old for this sort of thing. He was set in his ways. He was a cook in the real feudal tradition. If it didn't have an apple in its mouth and you couldn't roast it, he didn't want to serve it.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool hesitated with a card in his hand, suppressed his panic and thought quickly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'faith, nuncle,' he squeaked, 'thou't more full of questions than a martlebury is of mizzensails.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The cook relaxed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, okay,' he said, not entirely satisfied. The Fool lost the next three hands, just to be on the safe side.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The porter, meanwhile, unfastened the hatch in the wicket gate and peered out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who dost knock without?' he growled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The soldier, drenched and terrified though he was, hesitated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Without? Without what?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you're going to bugger about, you can bloody well stay without all day,' said the porter calmly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No! I must see the duke upon the instant!' shouted the guard. 'Witches are abroad!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The porter was about to come back with, 'Good time of year for it', or 'Wish I was, too', but stopped when he saw the man's face. It wasn't the face of a man who would enter into the spirit of the thing. It was the look of someone who had seen things a decent man shouldn't wot of . . .</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Witches?' said Lord Felmet. 'Witches!' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In the draughty corridors, a voice as faint as the wind in distant keyholes said, with a note of hope, 'Witches!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The psychically inclined ...</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's meddling, that's what it is,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'And no good will come of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's very <em class="calibre10">romantic,'</em> said Magrat breathily, and heaved a sigh.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Goochy goo,' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway,' said Magrat, 'you killed that horrid man!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I never did. I just encouraged . . . things to take their course.' Granny Weatherwax frowned. 'He didn't have no respect. Once people lose their respect, it means trouble.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Izzy wizzy wazzy, den.' <em class="calibre10">,</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That other man brought him out here to save him!' shouted Magrat. 'He wanted us to keep him safe! It's obvious! It's destiny!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, <em class="calibre10">obvious,'</em> said Granny. 'I'll grant you it's <em class="calibre10">obvious.</em> Trouble is, just because things are obvious doesn't mean they're true.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She weighed the crown in her hands. It felt very heavy, in a way that went beyond mere pounds and ounces.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but the point is—' Magrat began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The point is,' said Granny, 'that people are going to come looking. Serious people. Serious looking. Pull-down-the-walls and burn-off-the-thatch looking. And—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Howsa boy, den?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'—And,</span>
        </em>
        <span> Gytha , I'm sure we'll all be a <em class="calibre10">lot</em> happier if you'd stop gurgling like that!' Granny snapped. She could feel her nerves coming on. Her nerves always played up when she was unsure about things. Besides, they had retired to Magrat's cottage, and the decor was getting to her, because Magrat believed in Nature's wisdom and elves and the healing power of colours and the cycle of the seasons and a lot of other things Granny Weatherwax didn't have any truck with.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're not after telling me how to look after a child,' snapped Nanny Ogg mildly. 'And me with fifteen of my own?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm just saying that we ought to think about it,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two watched her for some time. 'Well?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's fingers drummed on the edge of the crown. She frowned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'First, we've got to take him away from here,' she said, and held up a hand. 'No, Gytha, I'm sure your cottage is ideal and everything, but it's not safe. He's got to be somewhere away from here, a long way away, where no-one knows who he is. </span>And then there's this.' She tossed the crown from hand to hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, that's easy,' said Magrat. 'I mean, you just hide it under a stone or something. That's easy. Much easier than babies.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It ain't,' said Granny. The reason being, the country's full of babies and they all look the same, but I don't reckon there's many crowns. They have this way of being found, anyway. They kind of call out to people's minds. If you bunged it under a stone up here, in a week's time it'd get itself discovered by accident. You mark my words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's true, is that,' said Nanny Ogg, earnestly. 'How many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest depths of the ocean and then, when you get home and have a nice bit of turbot for your tea, there it is?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They considered this in silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Never,' said Granny irritably. 'And nor have you. Anyway, he might want it back. If it's rightfully his, that is. Kings set a lot of store by crowns. Really, Gytha, sometimes you say the most—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll just make some tea, shall I?' said Magrat brightly, and disappeared into the scullery.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two elderly witches sat on either side of the table in polite and prickly silence. Finally Nanny Ogg said, 'She done it up nice, hasn't she? Flowers and everything. What are them things on the walls?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sigils,' said Granny sourly. 'Or some such.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fancy,' said Nanny Ogg, politely. 'And all them robes and wands and things too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Modern,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said Granny Weatherwax, with a sniff. 'When I was a gel, we had a lump of wax and a couple of pins and had to be content. We had to make our <em class="calibre10">own</em> enchantment in them days.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah, well, we've all passed a lot of water since then,' said Nanny Ogg sagely. She gave the baby a comforting jiggle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax sniffed. Nanny Ogg had been married three times and ruled a tribe of children and grandchildren all over the kingdom. Certainly, it was not actually <em class="calibre10">forbidden</em> for witches to get married. Granny had to concede that, but reluctantly. Very reluctantly. She sniffed again, disapprovingly; this was a mistake.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's that smell?' she snapped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said Nanny Ogg, carefully repositioning the baby. 'I expect I'll just go and see if Magrat has any clean rags, shall I?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And now Granny was left alone. She felt embarrassed, as one always does when left alone in someone else's room, and fought the urge to get up and inspect the books on the shelf over the sideboard or examine the mantelpiece for dust. She turned the crown round and round in her hands. Again, it gave the impression of being bigger and heavier than it actually was.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She caught sight of the mirror over the mantelpiece and looked down at the crown. It was tempting. It was practically begging her to try it for size. Well, and why not? She made sure that the others weren't around and then, in one movement, whipped off her hat and placed the crown on her head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It seemed to fit. Granny drew herself up proudly, and waved a hand imperiously in the general direction of the hearth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Jolly well do this,' she said. She beckoned arrogantly at the grandfather clock. 'Chop his head off, what ho,' she commanded. She smiled grimly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And froze as she heard the screams, and the thunder of horses, and the deadly whisper of arrows and the damp, solid sound of spears in flesh. Charge after charge echoed across her skull. Sword met shield, or sword, or bone -relentlessly. Years streamed across her mind in the space of a second. There were times when she lay among the dead, or hanging from the branch of a tree; but always there were hands that would pick her up again, and place her on a velvet cushion ...</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny very carefully lifted the crown off her head – it was an effort, it didn't like it much – and laid it on the table.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So that's being a king for you, is it?' she said softly. 'I wonder why they all want the job?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you take sugar?' said Magrat, behind her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You'd have to be a born fool to be a king,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned. 'Didn't see you come in,' she said. 'What was it you said?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sugar in your tea?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Three spoons,' said Granny promptly. It was one of the few sorrows of Granny Weatherwax's life that, despite all her efforts, she'd arrived at the peak of her career with a complexion like a rosy apple and all her teeth. No amount of charms could persuade a wart to take root on her handsome if slightly equine features, and vast intakes of sugar only served to give her boundless energy. A wizard she'd consulted had explained it was on account of her having a metabolism, which at least allowed her to feel vaguely superior to Nanny Ogg, who she suspected had never even seen one.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat dutifully dug out three heaped ones. It would be nice, she thought wistfully, if someone could say 'thank you' occasionally.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She became aware that the crown was staring at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can feel it, can you?' said Granny. 'I said, didn't I? Crowns call out!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's horrible.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, no. It's just being what it is. It can't help it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But it's magic!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's just being what it is,' Granny repeated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's trying to get me to try it on,' said Magrat, her hand hovering.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It does that, yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I shall be strong,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So I should think,' said Granny, her expression suddenly curiously wooden. 'What's Gytha doing?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's giving the baby a wash in the sink,' said Magrat vaguely. 'How can we hide something like this? What'd happen if we buried it really deeply somewhere?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A badger'd dig it up,' said Granny wearily. 'Or someone'd go prospecting for gold or something. Or a tree'd tangle its roots around it and then be blown over in a storm, and then someone'd pick it up and put it on—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Unless they were as strong-minded as us,' Magrat pointed out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Unless that, of course,' said Granny, staring at her finger-nails. Though the thing with crowns is, it isn't the putting them on that's the problem, it's the taking them off.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat picked it up and turned it over in her hands.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not as though it even looks much like a crown,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've seen a lot, I expect,' said Granny. 'You'd be an expert on them, naturally.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Seen a fair few. They've got a lot more jewels on them, and cloth bits in the middle,' said Magrat defiantly. 'This is just a thin little thing—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Magrat Garlick!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I have. When I was being trained up by Goodie Whemper—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—may sherestinpeace—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—maysherestinpeace, she used to take me over to Razorback or into Lancre whenever the strolling players were in town. She was very keen on the theatre. They've got more crowns than you can shake a stick at although, mind—' she paused – 'Goodie did say they're made of tin and paper and stuff. And just glass for the jewels. But they look more realler than this one. Do you think that's strange?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Things that try to look like things often do look more like things than things. Well-known fact,' said Granny. 'But I don't hold with encouraging it. What do they stroll about playing, then, in these crowns?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You don't know about the theatre?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax, who never declared her ignorance of anything, didn't hesitate. 'Oh, yes,' she said. 'It's one <em class="calibre10">of them</em> style of things, then, is it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Goodie Whemper said it held a mirror up to life,' said Magrat. 'She said it always cheered her up.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I expect it would,' said Granny, striking out. 'Played properly, at any rate. Good people, are they, these theatre players?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And they stroll around the country, you say?' said Granny thoughtfully, looking towards the scullery door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All over the place. There's a troupe in Lancre now, I heard. I haven't been because, you know.' Magrat looked down. ' 'Tis not right, a woman going into such places by herself.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded. She thoroughly approved of such sentiments so long as there was, of course, no suggestion that they applied to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She drummed her fingers on Magrat's tablecloth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' she said. 'And why not? Go and tell Gytha to wrap the baby up well. It's a long time since I heard a theatre played properly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was entranced, as usual. The theatre was no more than some lengths of painted sacking, a plank stage laid over a few barrels, and half a dozen benches set out in the village square. But at the same time it had also managed to become The Castle, Another Part of the Castle, The Same Part A Little Later, The Battlefield and now it was A Road Outside the City. The afternoon would have been perfect if it wasn't for Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After several piercing glares at the three-man orchestra to see if she could work out which instrument the theatre was, the old witch had finally paid attention to the stage, and it was beginning to become apparent to Magrat that there were certain fundamental aspects of the theatre that Granny had not yet grasped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She was currently bouncing up and down on her stool with rage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's killed him,' she hissed. 'Why isn't anyone doing anything about it? He's killed him! And right up there in front of everyone!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat held on desperately to her colleague's arm as she struggled to get to her feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's all right,' she whispered. 'He's not dead!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you calling me a liar, my girl?' snapped Granny. 'I saw it all!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look, Granny, it's not really real, d'you see?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax subsided a little, but still grumbled under her breath. She was beginning to feel that things were trying to make a fool of her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Up on the stage a man in a sheet was giving a spirited monologue. Granny listened intently for some minutes, and then nudged Magrat in the ribs.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's he on about now?' she demanded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's saying how sorry he was that the other man's dead,' said Magrat, and in an attempt to change the subject added hurriedly, 'There's a lot of crowns, isn't there?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny was not to be distracted. 'What'd he go and kill him for, then?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, it's a bit complicated—' said Magrat, weakly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's shameful!' snapped Granny. 'And the poor dead thing still lying there!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat gave an imploring look to Nanny Ogg, who was masticating an apple and studying the stage with the glare of a research scientist.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">reckon,'</em> she said slowly, 'I reckon it's all just pretendin'. Look, he's still breathing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The rest of the audience, who by now had already decided that this commentary was all part of the play, stared as one man at the corpse. It blushed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And look at his boots, too,' said Nanny critically. 'A real king'd be ashamed of boots like that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The corpse tried to shuffle its feet behind a cardboard bush.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny, feeling in some obscure way that they had scored a minor triumph over the purveyors of untruth and artifice, helped herself to an apple from the bag and began to take a fresh interest. Magrat's nerves started to unknot, and she began to settle down to enjoy the play. But not, as it turned out, for very long. Her willing suspension of disbelief was interrupted by a voice saying:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's this bit?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sighed. 'Well,' she hazarded, <em class="calibre10">'he</em> thinks that <em class="calibre10">he</em> is the prince, but <em class="calibre10">he's</em> really the other king's daughter, dressed up as a man.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny subjected the actor to a long analytical stare.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He <em class="calibre10">is</em> a man,' she said. 'In a straw wig. Making his voice squeaky.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat shuddered. She knew a little about the conventions of the theatre. She had been dreading this bit. Granny Weatherwax had Views.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but,' she said wretchedly, 'it's the Theatre, see. All the women are played by men.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They don't allow no women on the stage,' said Magrat in a small voice. She shut her eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact, there was no outburst from the seat on her left. She risked a quick glance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny was quietly chewing the same bit of apple over and over again, her eyes never leaving the action.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't make a fuss, Esme,' said Nanny, who also knew about Granny's Views. 'This is a good bit. I reckon I'm getting the hang of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Someone tapped Granny on the shoulder and a voice said, 'Madam, will you kindly remove your hat?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned around very slowly on her stool, as though propelled by hidden motors, and subjected the interrupter to a hundred kilowatt diamond-blue stare. The man wilted under it and sagged back on to his stool, her face following him all the way down.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He considered the options. 'All right,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned back and nodded to the actors, who had paused to watch her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know what you're staring at,' she growled. 'Get on with it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg passed her another bag.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Have a humbug,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Silence again filled the makeshift theatre except for the hesitant voices of the actors, who kept glancing at the bristling figure of Granny Weatherwax, and the sucking sounds of a couple of boiled humbugs being relentlessly churned from cheek to cheek.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then Granny said, in a piercing voice that made one actor drop his wooden sword, 'There's a man over on the side there whispering to them!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's a prompter,' said Magrat. 'He tells them what to say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't they know?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think they're forgetting,' said Magrat sourly. 'For some reason.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nudged Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's going on now?' she said. 'Why're all them kings and people up there?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a banquet, see,' said Nanny Ogg authoritatively. 'Because of the dead king, him in the boots, as was, only now if you look, you'll see he's pretending to be a soldier, and everyone's making speeches about how good he was and wondering who killed him.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are they?' said Granny, grimly. She cast her eyes along the cast, looking for the murderer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She was making up her mind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then she stood up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Her black shawl billowed around her like the wings of an avenging angel, come to rid the world of all that was foolishness and pretence and artifice and sham. She seemed somehow a lot bigger than normal. She pointed an angry finger at the guilty party.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He done it!' she shouted triumphantly. 'We all <em class="calibre10">seed</em> 'im! He done it with a dagger!'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The audience filed out, contented. It had been a good play on the whole, they decided, although not very easy to follow. But it had been a jolly good laugh when all the kings had run off, and the woman in black had jumped up and did all the shouting. That alone had been well worth the ha'penny admission.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The three witches sat alone on the edge of the stage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wonder how they get all them kings and lords to come here and do this?' said Granny, totally unabashed. 'I'd have thought they'd been too busy. Ruling and similar.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' said Magrat, wearily. 'I still don't think you quite understand.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I'm going to get to the bottom of it,' snapped Granny. She got back on to the stage and pulled aside the sacking curtains.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You!' she shouted. 'You're dead!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The luckless former corpse, who was eating a ham sandwich to calm his nerves, fell backwards off his stool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny kicked a bush. Her boot went right through it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'See?' she said to the world in general in a strangely satisfied voice. 'Nothing's real! It's all just paint, and sticks and paper at the back.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'May I assist you, good ladies?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a rich and wonderful voice, with every diphthong gliding beautifully into place. It was a golden brown voice. If the Creator of the multiverse had a voice, it was a voice such as this. If it had a drawback, it was that it wasn't a voice you could use, for example, for ordering coal. Coal ordered by this voice would become diamonds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It apparently belonged to a large fat man who had been badly savaged by a moustache. Pink veins made a map of quite a large city on his cheeks; his nose could have hidden successfully in a bowl of strawberries. He wore a ragged jerkin and holey tights with an aplomb that nearly convinced you that his velvet-and-vermine robes were in the wash just at the moment. In one hand he held a towel, with which he had clearly been removing the make-up that still greased his features.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know you,' said Granny. </span>'You done the murder.' She looked sideways at Magrat, and admitted, grudgingly, 'Leastways, it looked like it.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'So</span>
        </em>
        <span> glad. It is always a pleasure to meet a true connoisseur. Olwyn Vitoller, <em class="calibre10">at</em> your service. Manager of this band of vagabonds,' said the man and, removing his moth-eaten hat, he treated her to a low bow. It was less an obeisance than an exercise in advanced topology.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The hat swerved and jerked through a series of complex arcs, ending up at the end of an arm which was now pointing in the direction of the sky. One of his legs, meanwhile, had wandered off behind him. The rest of his body sagged politely until his head was level with Granny's knees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, well,' said Granny. She felt that her clothes had grown a bit larger and much hotter.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought you was very good, too,' said Nanny Ogg. 'The way you shouted all them words so graciously. I could tell you was a king.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I hope we didn't upset things,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My dear lady,' said Vitoller. 'Could I begin to tell you how gratifying it is for a mere mummer to learn that his audience has seen behind the mere shell of greasepaint to the spirit beneath?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I expect you could,' said Granny. 'I expect you could say anything, Mr Vitoller.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He replaced his hat and their eyes met in the long and calculating stare of one professional weighing up another. Vitoller broke first, and tried to pretend he hadn't been competing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now,' he said, 'to what do I owe this visit from three such charming ladies?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact he'd won. Granny's mouth fell open. She would not have described herself as anything much above 'handsome, considering'. Nanny, on the other hand, was as gummy as a baby and had a face like a small dried raisin. The best you could say for Magrat was that she was decently plain and well-scrubbed and as flat-chested as an ironing board with a couple of peas on it, even if her head was too well stuffed with fancies. Granny could feel something, some sort of magic at work. But not the kind she was used to.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was Vitoller's voice. By the mere process of articulation it transformed everything it talked about.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Look at the two of them, she told herself, primping away like a couple of ninnies. Granny stopped her hand in the process of patting her own iron-hard bun, and cleared her throat meaningfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We'd like to talk to you, Mr Vitoller.' She indicated the actors, who were dismantling the set and staying well out of her way, and added in a conspiratorial whisper, 'Somewhere private.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Dear lady, but of a certain,' he said. 'Currently I have lodgings in yonder esteemed watering hole.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches looked around. Eventually Magrat risked, 'You mean in the pub?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was cold and draughty in the Great Hall of Lancre Castle, and the new chamberlain's bladder wasn't getting any younger. He stood and squirmed under the gaze of Lady Felmet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes,' he said. 'We've got them all right. Lots.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And people don't <em class="calibre10">do</em> anything about them?' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The chamberlain blinked. 'I'm sorry?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'People tolerate them?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, indeed,' said the chamberlain happily. 'It's considered good luck to have a witch living in your village. My word, yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The chamberlain hesitated. The last time he had resorted to a witch it had been because certain rectal problems had turned the privy into a daily torture chamber, and the jar of ointment she had prepared had turned the world into a nicer place.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They smooth out life's little humps and bumps,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where I come from, we don't allow witches,' said the duchess sternly. 'And we don't propose to allow them here. You will furnish us with their addresses.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Addresses, ladyship?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where they live. I trust your tax gatherers know where to find them?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said the chamberlain, miserably.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke leaned forward on his throne.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I trust,' he said, 'that they do pay taxes?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not, exactly <em class="calibre10">pay</em> taxes, my lord,' said the chamberlain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence. Finally the duke prompted, 'Go on, man.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, it's more that they <em class="calibre10">don't</em> pay, you see. We never felt, that is, the old king didn't think... </span>Well, they just don't.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke laid a hand on his wife's arm.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I see,' he said coldly. 'Very well. You may go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The chamberlain gave him a brief nod of relief and scuttled crabwise from the hall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well!' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Indeed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That was how your family used to run a kingdom, was it? You had a positive <em class="calibre10">duty</em> to kill your cousin. It was clearly in the interests of the species,' said the duchess. 'The weak don't deserve to survive.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke shivered. She would keep on reminding him. He didn't, on the whole, object to killing people, or at least ordering them to be killed and then watching it happen. But killing a kinsman rather stuck in the throat or – he recalled – the liver.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Quite so,' he managed. 'Of course, there would appear to be many witches, and it might be difficult to find the three that were on the moor.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That doesn't matter.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course not.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Put matters in hand.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, my love.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Matters in hand. He'd put matters in hand all right. If he closed his eyes he could see the body tumbling down the steps. Had there been a hiss of shocked breath, down in the darkness of the hall? He'd been certain they were alone. Matters in hand! He'd tried to wash the blood off his hand. If he could wash the blood off, he told himself, it wouldn't have happened. He'd scrubbed and scrubbed. Scrubbed till he screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny wasn't at home in public houses. She sat stiffly to attention behind her port-and-lemon, as if it were a shield against the lures of the world.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg, on the other hand, was enthusiastically downing her third drink and, Granny thought sourly, was well along that path which would probably end up with her usual dancing on the table, showing her petticoats and singing 'The Hedgehog Can Never be Buggered at All'.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The table was covered with copper coins. Vitoller and his wife sat at either end, counting. It was something of a race.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny considered Mrs Vitoller as she snatched farthings from under her husband's fingers. She was an intelligent-looking woman, who appeared to treat her husband much as a sheepdog treats a favourite lamb. The complexities of the marital relationship were known to Granny only from a distance, in the same way that an astronomer can view the surface of a remote and alien world, but it had already occurred to her that a wife to Vitoller would have to be a very special woman with bottomless reserves of patience and organisational ability and nimble fingers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mrs Vitoller,' she said eventually, 'may I make so bold as to ask if your union has been blessed with fruit?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The couple looked blank.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She means—' Nanny Ogg began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, I see,' said Mrs Vitoller, quietly. 'No. We had a little girl once.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A small cloud hung over the table. For a second or two Vitoller looked merely human-sized, and much older. He stared at the small pile of cash in front of him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only, you see, there is this child,' said Granny, indicating the baby in Nanny Ogg's arms. 'And he needs a home.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Vitollers stared. Then the man sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It is no life for a child,' he said. 'Always moving. Always a new town. And no room for schooling. They say that's very important these days.' But his eyes didn't look away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Mrs Vitoller said, 'Why does he need a home?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He hasn't got one,' said Granny. 'At least, not one where he would be welcome.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The silence continued. Then Mrs Vitoller said, 'And you, who ask this, you are by way of being his—?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Godmothers,' said Nanny Ogg promptly. Granny was slightly taken aback. It never would have occurred to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller played abstractly with the coins in front of him. His wife reached out across the table and touched his hand, and there was a moment of unspoken communion. Granny looked away. She had grown expert at reading faces, but there were times when she preferred not to.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Money is, alas, tight—' Vitoller began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But it will stretch,' said his wife firmly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. I think it will. We should be happy to take care of him.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded, and fished in the deepest recesses of her cloak. At last she produced a small leather bag, which she tipped out on to the table. There was a lot of silver, and even a few tiny gold coins.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This should take care of—' she groped – 'nappies and suchlike. Clothes and things. Whatever.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A hundred times over, I should think,' said Vitoller weakly. 'Why didn't you mention this before?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If I'd had to buy you, you wouldn't be worth the price.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you doh't know anything about us!' said Mrs Vitoller.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We don't, do we?' said Granny, calmly. 'Naturally we'd like to hear how he gets along. You could send us letters and suchlike. But it would not be a good idea to talk about all this after you've left, do you see? For the sake of the child.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Mrs Vitoller looked at the two old women.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's something else here, isn't there?' she said. 'Something big behind all this?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny hesitated, and then nodded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But it would do us no good at all to know it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Another nod.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stood up as several actors came in, breaking the spell. Actors had a habit of filling all the space around them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I have other things to see to,' she said. 'Please excuse me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's his name?' said Vitoller.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tom,' said Granny, hardly hesitating.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'John,' said Nanny. The two witches exchanged glances. Granny won.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tom John,' she said firmly, and swept out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She met a breathless Magrat outside the door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I found a box,' she said. 'It had all the crowns and things in. So I put it in, like you said, right underneath everything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Our crown looked really tatty compared to the others!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It just goes to show, doesn't it,' said Granny. 'Did anyone see you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, everyone was too busy, but—' Magrat hesitated, and blushed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Out with it, girl.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just after that a man came up and pinched my bottom.' Magrat went a deep crimson and slapped her hand over her mouth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did he?' said Granny. 'And then what?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And then, and then—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He said, he said—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What did he say?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He said, "Hallo, my lovely, what are you doing tonight?" '</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny ruminated on this for a while and then she said, 'Old Goodie Whemper, she didn't get out and about much, did she?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was her leg, you know,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But she taught you all the midwifery and everything?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes, <em class="calibre10">that,'</em> said Magrat. 'I done lots.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But—' Granny hesitated, groping her way across unfamiliar territory – 'she never talked about what you might call the <em class="calibre10">previous.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You know,' said Granny, with an edge of desperation in her voice. 'Men and such.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked as if she was about to panic. 'What about them?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax had done many unusual things in her time, and it took a lot to make her refuse a challenge. But this time she gave in.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' she said helplessly, 'that it might be a good idea if you have a quiet word with Nanny Ogg one of these days. Fairly soon.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a cackle of laughter from the window behind them, a chink of glasses, and a thin voice raised in song: —with a giraffe, If you stand on a stool. But the hedgehog—' Granny stopped listening. 'Only not just now,' she added.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The troupe got under way a few hours before sunset, their four carts lurching off down the road that led towards the Sto plains and the big cities. Lancre had a town rule that all mummers, mountebanks and other potential criminals were outside the gates by sundown; it didn't offend anyone really because the town had no walls to speak of, and no-one much minded if people nipped back in again after dark. It was the look of the thing that counted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches watched from Magrat's cottage, using Nanny Ogg's ancient green crystal ball.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's about time you learned how to get sound on this thing,' Granny muttered. She gave it a nudge, filling the image with ripples.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was very strange,' said Magrat. 'In those carts. The things they had! Paper trees, and all kinds of costumes, and—' she waved her hands – 'there was this great big picture of forn parts, with all temples and things all rolled up. It was beautiful.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny grunted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought it was amazing the way all those people became kings and things, didn't you? It was like magic.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Magrat Garlick, what are you saying? It was just paint and paper. Anyone could see that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat opened her mouth to speak, ran the ensuing argument through her head, and shut it again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where's Nanny?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's lying out on the lawn,' said Granny. 'She felt a bit poorly.' And from outside came the sound of Nanny Ogg being poorly at the top of her voice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You know,' she said, 'if we <em class="calibre10">are</em> his godmothers, we ought to have given him three gifts. It's traditional.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you talking about, girl?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Three good witches are supposed to give the baby three gifts. You know, like good looks, wisdom and happiness.' Magrat pressed on defiantly. 'That's how it used to be done in the old days.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, you mean gingerbread cottages and all that,' said Granny dismissively. 'Spinning wheels and pumpkins and pricking your finger on rose thorns and similar. I could never be having with all that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She polished the ball reflectively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but—' Magrat said. Granny glanced up at her. That was Magrat for you. Head full of pumpkins. Everyone's fairy godmother, for two pins. But a good soul, underneath it all. Kind to small furry animals. The sort of person who worried about baby birds falling out of nests.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look, if it makes you any happier,' she muttered, surprised at herself. She waved her hands vaguely over the image of the departing carts. 'What's it to be – wealth, beauty?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, money isn't everything, and if he takes after his father he'll be handsome enough,' Magrat said, suddenly serious. 'Wisdom, do you think?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's something he'll have to learn for himself,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Perfect eyesight? A good singing voice?' From the lawn outside came Nanny Ogg's cracked but enthusiastic voice telling the night sky that A Wizard's Staff Has A Knob On The End.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not important,' said Granny loudly. 'You've got to think headology, see? Not muck about with all this beauty and. wealth business. That's not important.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned back to the ball and gestured half-heartedly. 'You'd better go and get Nanny, then, seeing as there should be three of us.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny was helped in, eventually, and had to have things explained to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Three gifts, eh?' she said. 'Haven't done one of them things since I was a gel, it takes me back – what're you doing?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was bustling around the room, lighting candles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, we've got to create the right magical ambience,' she explained. Granny shrugged, but said nothing, even in the face of the extreme provocation. All witches did their magic in their own way, and this was Magrat's house.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What're we going to give him, then?' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We was just discussing it,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know what he'll want,' said Nanny. She made a suggestion, which was received in frozen silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't see what use <em class="calibre10">that</em> would be,' said Magrat, eventually. 'Wouldn't it be rather uncomfortable?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He'll thank us when he grows up, you mark my words,' said Nanny. 'My first husband, he always said—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Something a bit less physical is generally the style of things,' interrupted Granny, glaring at Nanny Ogg. 'There's no need to go and spoil everything, Gytha. Why do you always have to—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, at least I can say that I—' Nanny began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Both voices faded to a mutter. There was a long edgy silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' said Magrat, with brittle brightness, 'that perhaps it would be a good idea if we all go back to our little cottages and do it in our own way. You know. Separately. It's been a long day and we're all rather tired.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good idea,' said Granny firmly, and stood up. 'Come, Nanny Ogg,' she snapped. 'It's been a long day and we're all rather tired.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat heard them bickering as they wandered down the path.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She sat rather sadly amidst the coloured candles, holding a small bottle of extremely thaumaturgical incense that she had ordered from a magical supplies emporium in faraway Ankh-Morpork. She had been rather looking forward to trying it. Sometimes, she thought, it would be nice if people could be a bit kinder . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stared at the ball.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Well, she could make a start.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He will make friends easily,' she whispered. It wasn't much, she knew, but it was something she'd never been able to get the hang of.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg, sitting alone in her kitchen with her huge tomcat curled up on her lap, poured herself a nightcap and through the haze tried to remember the words of verse seventeen of the Hedgehog song. There was something about goats, she recalled, but the details eluded her. Time abraded memory.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She toasted the invisible presence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A bloody good memory is what he ought to have,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He'll always remember the words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And Granny Weatherwax, striding home alone through the midnight forest, wrapped her shawl around her and considered. It had been a long day, and a trying one. The theatre had been the worst part. All people pretending to be other people, things happening that weren't real, bits of countryside you could put your foot through... </span>Granny liked to know where she stood, and she wasn't certain she stood for that sort of thing. <span>The world seemed to be changing all the time.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It didn't use to change so much. It was bewildering.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She walked quickly through the darkness with the frank stride of someone who was at least certain that the forest, on this damp and windy night, contained strange and terrible things and she was it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let him be whoever he minks he is,' she said. 'That's all anybody could hope for in this world.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Like most people, witches <em class="calibre10">are</em> unfocused in time. The difference is that they dimly realise it, and make use of it. They cherish the past because part of them is still living there, and they can see the shadows the future casts before it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny could feel the shape of the future, and it had knives in it.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It began at five the next morning. Four men rode through the woods near Granny's cottage, tethered the horses out of earshot, and crept very cautiously through the mists.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant in charge was not happy in his work. He was a Ramtops man, and wasn't at all certain about how you went about arresting a witch. He was pretty certain, though, that the witch wouldn't like the idea. He didn't like the idea of a witch not liking the idea.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The men were Ramtoppers as well. They were following him very closely, ready to duck behind him at the first sign of anything more unexpected than a tree.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's cottage was a fungoid shape in the mist. Her unruly herb garden seemed to move, even in the still air. It contained plants seen nowhere else in the mountains, their roots and seeds traded across five thousand miles of the Discworld, and the sergeant could swear that one or two blooms turned towards him. He shuddered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What now, sarge?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We – we spread out,' he said. 'Yes. We spread out, That's what we do.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They moved carefully through the bracken. The sergeant crouched behind a handy log, and said, 'Right. Very good. You've got the general idea. Now let's spread out again, and this time we spread out separately.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The men grumbled a bit, but disappeared into the mist. The sergeant gave them a few minutes to take up positions, then said, 'Right. Now we—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He paused.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wondered whether he dared shout, and decided against it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stood up. He removed his helmet, to show respect, and sidled through the damp grass to the back door. He knocked, very gently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a wait of several seconds he clamped his helmet back on his head, said, 'No-one in. Blast', and started to stride away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The door opened. It opened very slowly, and with the maximum amount of creak. Simple neglect wouldn't have caused that depth of groan; you'd need careful work with hot water over a period of weeks. The sergeant stopped, and then turned round very slowly while contriving to move as few muscles as possible.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He had mixed feelings about the fact that there was nothing in the doorway. In his experience, doors didn't just open themselves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He cleared his throat nervously.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax, right by his ear, said, 'That's a nasty cough you've got there. You did right in coming to me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant looked up at her with an expression of mad gratitude. He said, 'Argle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She did <em class="calibre10">what?'</em> said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant stared fixedly at an area a few inches to the right of the duke's chair.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She give me a cup of tea, sir,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And what about your men?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She give them one too, sir.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke rose from his chair and put his arms around the sergeant's rusting chain mail shoulders. He was in a bad mood. He had spent half the night washing his hands. He kept thinking that something was whispering in his ear. His breakfast oatmeal had been served up too salty and roasted with an apple in it, and the cook had hysterics in the kitchen. You could tell the duke was extremely annoyed. He was polite. The duke was the kind of man who becomes more and more agreeable as his temper drains away, until the point is reached where the words 'Thank you so much' have the cutting edge of a guillotine.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sergeant,' he said, walking the man slowly across the floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm not sure I made your orders clear, sergeant,' said the duke, in snake tones.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean, it is possible I may have confused you. I meant to say "Bring me a witch, in chains if necessary", but perhaps what I <em class="calibre10">really</em> said was "Go and have a cup of tea". Was this in fact the case?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant wrinkled his forehead. Sarcasm had not hitherto entered his life. His experience of people being annoyed with him generally involved shouting and occasional bits of wood.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, sir,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wonder why, then, you did not in fact do this thing that I asked?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I expect she said some magic words, did she? I've heard about witches,' said the duke, who had spent the night before reading, until his bandaged hands shook too much, some of the more excitable works on the subject<a href="#note_3" title="Written by wizards, who are celibate and get some pretty funny ideas around four o'clock in the morning."><sup class="calibre11">[3]</sup></a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I imagine she offered you visions of unearthly delight? Did she show you—' the duke shuddered – 'dark fascinations and forbidden raptures, the like of which mortal men should not even think of, and demonic secrets that took you to the depths of man's desires?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke sat down and fanned himself with his handkerchief.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you all right, sir?' said the sergeant.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What? Oh, perfectly, perfectly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only you've gone all red.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't change the subject, man,' snapped the duke, pulling himself together a bit. 'Admit it – she offered you hedonistic and licentious pleasures known only to those who dabble in the carnal arts, didn't she?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant stood to attention and stared straight ahead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, sir,' he said, in the manner of one speaking the truth come what may. 'She offered me a bun.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A bun?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, sir. It had currants in it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Felmet sat absolutely still while he fought for internal peace. Finally, all he could manage was, 'And what did your men do about this?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They had a bun too, sir. All except young Roger, who isn't allowed fruit, sir, on account of his trouble.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke sagged back on the window seat and put his hand over his eyes. I was born to rule down on the plains, he thought, where it's all flat and there isn't all this weather and everything and there are people who don't appear to be made of dough. He's going to tell me what this Roger had.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He had a biscuit, sir.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke stared out at the trees. He was angry. He was extremely angry. But twenty years of marriage to Lady Felmet had taught him not simply to control his emotions but to control his instincts as well, and not so much as the twitching of a muscle indicated the workings of his mind. Besides, arising out of the black depths of his head was an emotion that, hitherto, he had little time for. Curiosity was flashing a fin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke had managed quite well for fifty years without finding a use for curiosity. It was not a trait much encouraged in aristocrats. He had found certainty was a much better bet. However, it occurred to him that for once curiosity might have its uses.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sergeant was standing in the middle of the floor with the stolid air of one who is awaiting a word of command, and who is quite prepared so to wait until continental drift budges him from his post. He had been in the undemanding service of the kings of Lancre for many years, and it showed. His body was standing to attention. Despite all his efforts his stomach stood at ease.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke's gaze fell on the Fool, who was sitting on his stool by the throne. The hunched figure looked up, embarrassed, and gave his bells a half-hearted shake.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke reached a decision. The way to progress, he'd found, was to find weak spots. He tried to shut away the thought that these included such things as a king's kidneys at the top of a dark stairway, and concentrated on the matter in hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">... hand. <span>He'd scrubbed and scrubbed, but it seemed to have no effect. Eventually he'd gone down to the dungeons and borrowed one of the torturer's wire brushes, and scrubbed and scrubbed with that, too. That had no effect, either. It made it worse. The harder he scrubbed, the more blood there was. He was afraid he might go mad . . .</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wrestled the thought to the back of his mind. Weak spots. That was it. The Fool looked all weak spot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You may go, sergeant.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sir,' said the sergeant, and marched out stiffly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fool?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, sir—' said the Fool nervously, and gave his hated mandolin a quick strum.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke sat down on the throne.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am already extremely married,' he said. 'Advise me, my Fool.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'faith, nuncle—' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nor am I thy nuncle. I feel sure I would have remembered,' said Lord Felmet, leaning down until the prow of his nose was a few inches from the Fool's stricken face. 'If you preface your next remark with nuncle, i'faith or marry, it will go hard with you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool moved his lips silently, and then said, 'How do you feel about Prithee?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke knew when to allow some slack. 'Prithee I can live with,' he said. </span>'So can you. But no capering.' He grinned encouragingly. <span>'How long have you been a Fool, boy?'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Prithee, sirrah—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The sirrah,' said the duke, holding up a hand, 'on the whole, I think not.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Prithee, sirra – sir,' said the Fool, and swallowed nervously. 'All my life, sir. Seventeen years under the bladder, man and boy. And my father before me. And my nuncle at the same time as him. And my grandad before them. And his-'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your whole family have been Fools?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Family tradition, sir,' said the Fool. 'Prithee, I mean.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke smiled again, and the Fool was too worried to notice how many teeth it contained.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You come from these parts, don't you?' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ma – Yes, sir.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So you would know all about the native beliefs and so on?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose so, sir. Prithee.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good. Where do you sleep, my Fool?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'In the stables, sir.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'From now on you may sleep in the corridor outside my room,' said the duke beneficently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Gosh!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now,' said the duke, his voice dripping across the Fool like treacle over a pudding, 'tell me about witches...'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>That night the Fool slept on good royal flagstones in the whistling corridor above the Great Hall instead of the warm stuffy straw of the stables.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is foolish,' he told himself. 'Marry, but is it foolish <em class="calibre10">enough!'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He dozed off fitfully, into some sort of dream where a vague figure kept trying to attract his attention, and was only dimly aware of the voices of Lord and Lady Felmet on the other side of the door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's certainly a lot less draughty,' said the duchess grudgingly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke sat back in the armchair and smiled at his wife.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well?' she demanded. 'Where are the witches?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The chamberlain would appear to be right, beloved. The witches seem to have the local people in thrall. </span>The sergeant of the guard came back empty-handed.' Handed . . . he came down heavily on the importunate thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You must have him executed,' she said promptly. 'To make an example to the others.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A course of action, my dear, which ultimately results in us ordering the last soldier to cut his own throat as an example to himself. By the way,' he added mildly, 'there would appear to be somewhat fewer servants around the place. You know I would not normally interfere—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then don't,' she snapped. 'Housekeeping is under my control. I cannot abide <em class="calibre10">slackness.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm sure you know best, but—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What of these witches? Will you stand idly by and let trouble seed for thg future? Will you let these witches defy you? What of the crown?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke shrugged. 'No doubt it ended in the river,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And the child? He was <em class="calibre10">given</em> to the witches? Do they do human sacrifice?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It would appear not,' said the duke. The duchess looked vaguely disappointed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'These witches,' said the duke. 'Apparently, they seem to cast a spell on people.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, obviously—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not like a magic spell. They seem to be respected. They do medicine and so on. It's rather strange. The mountain people seem to be afraid of them and proud of them at the same time, It might be a little difficult to move against them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I could come to believe,' said the duchess darkly, 'that they have cast a glamour over you as well.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact the duke <em class="calibre10">was</em> intrigued. Power was always darkly fascinating, which was why he had married the duchess in the first place. He stared fixedly at the fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'In fact.' said the duchess, who recognised the malign smile, 'you like it, don't you? The thought of the danger. I remember when we were married; all that business with the knotted rope—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She snapped her fingers in front of the duke's glazed eyes, He sat up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not at all!' he shouted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then what will you do?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wait.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Waif?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wait, and consider. </span>Patience is a virtue.' The duke sat back. <span>The smile he smiled could have spent a million years sitting on a rock. And then, just below one eye, he started to twitch. Blood was oozing between the bandages on his hand.</span></div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Once again the full moon rode the clouds.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax milked and fed the goats, banked me fire put a cloth over the minor and pulled her broomstick out from behind the door. She went out, locked the back door behind her, and hung the key on its nail in the privy.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This was quite sufficient. Only once, in the entire history of witchery in the Ramtops, had a thief broken into a witch's cottage. The witch concerned visited the most terrible punishment on him<a href="#note_4" title="She did nothing, although sometimes when she saw him in the village she'd smile in a faint, puzzled way. After three weeks of this the suspense was too much for him and he took his own life; in fact he took it all the way across the continent, where he became a reformed character and never went home again."><sup class="calibre11">[4]</sup></a>.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sat on the broom and muttered a few words, but without much conviction. After a further couple of tries she got off, fiddled with the binding, and had another go. There was a suspicion of glitter from one end of the stick, which quickly died away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Drat,' she said, under her breath.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked around carefully, in case anyone was watching. In fact it was only a hunting badger who, hearing the thumping of running feet, poked its head out from the bushes and saw Granny hurtling down the path with the broomstick held stiff-armed beside her. At last the magic caught, and she managed to vault clumsily on to it before it trundled into the night sky as gracefully as a duck with one wing missing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>From above the trees came a muffled curse against all dwarfish mechanics.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Most witches preferred to live in isolated cottages with the traditional curly chimneys and weed-grown thatch. Granny Weatherwax approved of this; it was no good being a witch unless you let people <em class="calibre10">know.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg didn't care much about what people knew and even less for what they thought, and lived in a new, knick-knack crammed cottage in the middle of Lancre town itself and at the heart of her own private empire. Various daughters and daughters-in-law came in to cook and clean on a sort of rota. Every </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>flat surface was stuffed with ornaments brought back by far-travelling members of the family. Sons and grandsons kept the logpile stacked, the roof shingled, the chimney swept; the drinks cupboard was always full, the pouch by her rocking chair always stuffed with tobacco. Above the hearth was a huge pokerwork sign saying 'Mother'. No tyrant in the whole history of the world had ever achieved a domination so complete.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg also kept a cat, a huge one-eyed grey torn called Greebo who divided his time between sleeping, eating and fathering the most enormous incestuous feline tribe. He opened his eye like a yellow window into Hell when he heard Granny's broomstick land awkwardly on the back lawn. With the instinct of his kind he recognised Granny as an inveterate cat-hater and oozed gently under a chair.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was already seated primly by the fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It is one of the few unbendable rules of magic that its practitioners cannot change their own appearance for any length of time. Their bodies develop a kind of morphic inertia and gradually return to their original shape. But Magrat tried. Every morning her hair was long, thick and blond, but by the evening it had always returned to its normal worried frizz. To ameliorate the effect she had tried to plait violets and cowslips in it. The result was not all she had hoped. It gave the impression that a window box had fallen on her head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good evening,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well met by moonlight,' said Magrat politely. 'Merry meet. A star shines on—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wotcha,' said Nanny Ogg. Magrat winced.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sat down and started removing the pins that nailed her tall hat to her bun. Finally the sight of Magrat dawned on her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Magrat!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The young witch jumped, and clamped her knuckly hands to the virtuous frontage of her gown.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' she quavered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What have you got on your lap?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's my familiar,' she said defensively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What happened to that toad you had?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It wandered off,' muttered Magrat. 'Anyway, it wasn't very good.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sighed. Magrat's desperate search for a reliable familiar had been going on for some time, and despite the love and attention she lavished on them they all seemed to have some terrible flaw, such as a tendency to bite, get trodden on or, in extreme cases, metamorphose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That makes fifteen this year,' said Granny. 'Not counting the horse. What's this one?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a rock,' chuckled Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, at least it should last,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The rock extended a head and gave her a look of mild amusement.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a tortoyse,' said Magrat. 'I bought it down in Sheep-ridge market. It's incredibly old and knows many secrets, the man said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know that man,' said Granny. 'He's the one who sells goldfish that tarnish after a day or two.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway, I shall call him Lightfoot,' said Magrat, her voice warm with defiance. 'I can if I want.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes, all right, I'm sure,' said Granny. 'Anyway, how goes it, sisters? It is two months since last we met.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It should be every new moon,' said Magrat sternly. 'Regular.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was our Grame's youngest's wedding,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Couldn't miss it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And I was up all night with a sick goat,' said Granny Weatherwax promptly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, well,' said Magrat doubtfully. She rummaged in her bag. 'Anyway, if we're going to start, we'd better light the candles.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The senior witches exchanged a resigned glance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we got this lovely new lamp our Tracie sent me,' said Nanny Ogg innocently. 'And I was going to poke up the fire a bit.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I have excellent night vision, Magrat,' said Granny sternly. 'And you've been reading them funny books. Grimmers.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Grimoires—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You ain't going to draw on the floor again, neither,' warned Nanny Ogg. 'It took our Dreen days to clean up all those wossnames last time—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Runes,' said Magrat. There was a look of pleading in her eyes. 'Look, just one candle?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' said Nanny Ogg, relenting a bit. 'If it makes you feel any better. Just the one, mind. And a decent white one. Nothing fancy.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sighed. It probably wasn't a good idea to bring out the rest of the contents of her bag.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ought to get a few more here,' she said sadly. 'It's not right, a coven of three.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't know we was still a coven. No-one told me we was still a coven,' sniffed Granny Weatherwax. 'Anyway, there's no-one else this side of the mountain, excepting old Gammer Dismass, and she doesn't get out these days.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But a lot of young girls in my village . . .' said Magrat. 'You know. They could be keen.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's not how we do it, as well you know,' said Granny disapprovingly. 'People don't go and find witchcraft, it comes and finds them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes,' said Magrat. 'Sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' said Granny, slightly mollified. She'd never mastered the talent for apologising, but she appreciated it in other people.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What about this new duke, then,' said Nanny, to lighten the atmosphere.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sat back. 'He had some houses burned down in Bad Ass,' she said. 'Because of taxes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How horrible,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Old Kind Verence used to do that,' said Nanny. 'Terrible temper he had.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'He</span>
        </em>
        <span> used to let people get out first, though,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh yes,' said Nanny, who was a staunch royalist. 'He could be very gracious like that. He'd pay for them to be rebuilt, as often as not. If he remembered.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And every Hogswatchnight, a side of venison. Regular,' said Granny wistfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes. Very respectful to witches, he was,' added Nanny Ogg. 'When he was out hunting people, if he met me in the woods, it was always off with his helmet and "I hope I finds you well, Mistress Ogg" and next day he'd send his butler down with a couple of bottles of something. He was a proper king.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hunting people isn't really right, though,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, no,' Granny Weatherwax conceded. 'But it was only if they'd done something bad. He said they enjoyed it really. And he used to let them go if they gave him a good run,'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And then there was that great hairy thing of his,' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a perceptible change in the atmosphere. It became warmer, darker, filled at the corners with the shadows of unspoken conspiracy.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said Granny Weatherwax distantly. 'His <em class="calibre10">droit de seigneur</em>.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Needed a lot of exercise,' said Nanny Ogg, staring at the fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But next day he'd send his housekeeper round with a bag of silver and a hamper of stuff for the wedding,' said Granny. 'Many a couple got a proper start in life thanks to that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' agreed Nanny. 'One or two individuals, too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Every inch a king,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you talking about?' said Magrat suspiciously. 'Did he keep pets?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two witches surfaced from whatever deeper current they had been swimming in. Granny Weatherwax shrugged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I must say,' Magrat went on, in severe tones, 'if you think so much of the old king, you don't seem very worried about him being killed. I mean, it was a pretty suspicious accident.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's kings for you,' said Granny. 'They come and go, good and bad. His father poisoned the king we had before.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That was old Thargum,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Had a big red beard, I recall. He was very gracious too, you know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only now no-one must say Felmet killed the king,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He had some people executed in Lancre, the other day for saying it,' Magrat went on. 'Spreading malicious lies, he said. He said anyone saying different will see the inside of his dungeons, only not for long. He said Verence died of natural causes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, being assassinated <em class="calibre10">is</em> natural causes for a king,' said Granny. 'I don't see why he's so sheepish about it. When old Thargum was killed they stuck his head on a pole, had a big bonfire and everyone in the palace got drunk for a week.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I remember,' said Nanny. 'They carried his head all round the villages to show he was dead. Very convincing, I thought. Specially for him. He was grinning. I think it was the way he would have liked to go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think we might have to keep an eye on this one, though,' said Granny. 'I think he might be a bit clever. That's not a good thing, in a king. And I don't think he knows how to show respect.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A man came to see me last week to ask if I wanted to pay any taxes,' said Magrat. 'I told him no.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He came to see me, too,' said Nanny Ogg. 'But our Jason and our Wane went out and tole him we didn't want to join.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Small man, bald, black cloak?' said Granny thoughtfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said the other two.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He was hanging about in my raspberry bushes,' said Granny. 'Only, when I went out to see what he wanted, he ran away.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Actually, I gave him tuppence,' said Magrat. 'He said he was going to be tortured, you see, if he didn't get witches to pay their taxes ...'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lord Felmet looked carefully at the two coins in his lap.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then he looked at his tax gatherer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The tax gatherer cleared his throat. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, sir, you see. I explained about the need to employ a standing army, ekcetra, and they said why, and I said because of bandits, ekcetra, and they said bandits never bothered them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And civil works?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah. Yes. Well, I pointed out the need to build and maintain bridges, ekcetra.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They said they didn't use them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said the duke knowledgeably. 'They can't cross running water.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not sure about that, sir. I think witches cross anything they like.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did they say anything else?' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The tax gatherer twisted the hem of his robe distractedly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, sir. I mentioned how taxes help to maintain the King's Peace, sir ... </span>'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They said the king should maintain his own peace, sir. And then they gave me a look.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What sort of look?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke sat with his thin face cupped in one hand. He was fascinated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's sort of hard to describe,' said the taxman. He tried to avoid Lord Felmet's gaze, which was giving him the distinct impression that the tiled floor was fleeing away in all directions and had already covered several acres. Lord Felmet's fascination was to him what a pin is to a Purple Emperor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Try,' the duke invited.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The taxman blushed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well,' he said. 'It ... wasn't nice.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Which demonstrates that the tax gatherer was much better at figures than words. What he would have said, if embarrassment, fear, poor memory and a complete lack of any kind of imagination hadn't conspired against it, was:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When I was a little boy, and staying with my aunt, and she had told me not to touch the cream, ekcetra, and she had put it on a high shelf in the pantry, and I got a stool and went after it when she was out anyway, and she'd come back and I didn't know, and I couldn't reach the bowl properly and it smashed on the floor, and she opened the door and glared at me: it was that look. But the worst thing was, they <em class="calibre10">knew</em> it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not nice,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, sir.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke drummed the fingers of his left hand on the arm of his throne. The tax gatherer coughed again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're – you're not going to force me to go back, are you?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Um?' said the duke. He waved a hand irritably. 'No, no,' he said. 'Not at all. Just call in at the torturer on your way out. See when he can fit you in.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The taxman gave him a look of gratitude, and bobbed a bow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, sir. At once, sir. Thank you, sir. You're very—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes,' said Lord Felmet, absently. 'You may go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke was left alone in the vastness of the hall. It was raining again. Every once in a while a piece of plaster smashed down on the tiles, and there was a crunching from the walls as they settled still further. The air smelled of old cellars.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Gods, he hated this kingdom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was so small, only forty miles long and maybe ten miles wide, and nearly all of it was cruel mountains with ice-green slopes and knife-edge crests, or dense huddled forests. A kingdom like that shouldn't be any trouble.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>What he couldn't quite fathom was this feeling that it had <em class="calibre10">depth.</em> It seemed to contain far too much geography.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He rose and paced the floor to the balcony, with its unrivalled view of trees. It struck him that the trees were also looking back at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He could feel the resentment. But that was odd, because the people themselves hadn't objected. They didn't seem to object to anything very much. Verence had been popular enough, in his way. There'd been quite a turnout for the funeral; he recalled the lines of solemn faces. Not stupid faces. By no means stupid. Just preoccupied, as though what kings did wasn't really very important.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He found that almost as annoying as trees. A jolly good riot, now, that would have been more – more appropriate. One could have ridden out and hanged people, there would have been the creative tension so essential to the proper development of the state. Back down on the plains, if you kicked people they kicked back. Up here, when you kicked people they moved away and just waited patiently for your leg to fall off. How could a king go down in history ruling a people like that? You couldn't oppress them any more than you could oppress a mattress.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He had raised taxes and burned a few villages on general principles, just to show everyone who they were dealing with. It didn't seem to have any effect.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then there were these witches. They haunted him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fool!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool, who had been having a quiet doze behind the throne, awoke in terror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come hither, Fool.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool jingled miserably across the floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tell me, Fool, does it always rain here?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, nuncle—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just answer the question,' said Lord Felmet, with iron patience.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sometimes it stops, sir. To make room for the snow. And sometimes we get some right squand'ring orgulous fogs,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Orgulous?' said the duke, absently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool couldn't stop himself. His horrified ears heard his mouth blurt out: 'Thick, my lord. From the Latatian <em class="calibre10">orgulum,</em> a soup or broth.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But the duke wasn't listening. Listening to the prattle of underlings was not, in his experience, particularly worthwhile.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am bored, Fool.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let me entertain you, my lord, with many a merry quip and lightsome jest.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Try me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool licked his dry lips. He hadn't actually expected this. King Verence had been happy enough just to give him a kick, or throw a bottle at his head. A <em class="calibre10">real</em> king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm waiting. Make me laugh.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool took the plunge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why, sirrah,' he quavered, 'why may a caudled fillhorse be deemed the brother to a hiren candle in the night?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke frowned. The Fool felt it better not to wait.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Withal, because a candle may be greased, yet a fillhorse be without a fat argier,' he said and, because it was part of the joke, patted Lord Felmet lightly with his balloon on a stick and twanged his mandolin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke's index finger tapped an abrupt tattoo on the arm of the throne.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' he said. 'And then what happened?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That, er, was by way of being the whole thing,' said the Fool, and added, 'My grandad thought it was one of his best.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I daresay he told it differently,' said the duke. He stood up. 'Summon my huntsmen. I think I shall ride out on the chase. And you can come too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My lord, I cannot ride!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>For the first time that morning Lord Felmet smiled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Capital!' he said. 'We will give you a horse that can't be ridden. Ha. Ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He looked down at his bandages. And afterwards, he told himself, I'll get the armourer to send me up a file.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A year went past. The days followed one another patiently. Right back at the beginning of the multiverse they had tried all passing at the same time, and it hadn't worked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon sat under Hwel's rickety table, watching his father as he walked up and down between the lattys, waving one arm and talking. </span>Vitoller always waved his arms when he spoke; if you tied his hands behind his back he would be dumb.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'All right,' he was saying, 'how about <em class="calibre10">The King's Brides?'</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Last year,' said the voice of Hwel.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'All right, then. We'll give them <em class="calibre10">Mallo, the Tyrant of Klatch,'</em> said Vitoller, and his larynx smoothly changed gear as his voice became a great rolling thing that could rattle the windows across the width of the average town square. ' "In blood I came, And by blood rule, That none will dare assay these walls of blood—" '</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'We did it the year before,' said Hwel calmly. 'Anyway, people are fed up with kings. They want a bit of a chuckle.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'They are not fed up with <em class="calibre10">my</em> kings,' said Vitoller. 'My dear boy, people do not come to the theatre to laugh, they come to Experience, to Learn, to Wonder—'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'To laugh,' said Hwel, flatly. 'Have a look at this one.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Tomjon heard the rustle of paper and the creak of wicker-work as Vitoller lowered his weight on to a props basket.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">'A Wizard of Sons,'</em> Vitoller read. <em class="calibre10">'Or, Please Yourself:</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hwel stretched his legs under the table and dislodged Tomjon. He hauled the boy out by one ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What's this?' said Vitoller. 'Wizards? Demons? Imps? Merchants?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I'm rather pleased with Act II, Scene IV,' said Hwel, propelling the toddler towards the props box. 'Comic Washing Up with Two Servants.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Any death-bed scenes?' said Vitoller hopefully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No-o,' said Hwel. 'But I can do you a humorous monologue in Act III.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'A humorous monologue!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'All right, there's room for a soliloquy in the last act,' said Hwel hurriedly. 'I'll write one tonight, no problem.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And a stabbing,' said Vitoller, getting to his feet. 'A foul murder. That always goes down well.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He strode away to organise the setting up of the stage.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hwel sighed, and picked up his quill. Somewhere behind the sacking walls was the town of Hangdog, which had somehow allowed itself to be built in a hollow perched in the nearly sheer walls of a canyon. There was plenty of flat ground in the Ramtops. The problem was that nearly all of it was vertical.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hwel didn't like the Ramtops, which was odd because it was traditional dwarf country and he was a dwarf. But he'd been banished from his tribe years ago, not only because of his claustrophobia but also because he had a tendency to daydream. It was felt by the local dwarf king that this is not a valuable talent for someone who is supposed to swing a pickaxe without forgetting what he is supposed to hit with it, and so Hwel had been given a very small bag of gold, the tribe's heartfelt best wishes, and a firm goodbye.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had happened that Vitoller's strolling players had been passing through at the time, and the dwarf had ventured one small copper coin on a performance of <em class="calibre10">The Dragon of the Plains.</em> He had watched it without a muscle moving in his face, gone back to his lodgings, and in the morning had knocked on Vitoller's latty with the first draft <em class="calibre10">of King Under the Mountain.</em> It wasn't in fact very good, but Vitoller had been perceptive enough to see that inside the hairy bullet head was an imagination big enough to bestride the world and so, when the strolling players strolled off, one of them was running to keep up . . .</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Particles of raw inspiration sleet through the universe all the time. Every once in a while one of them hits a receptive mind, which then invents DNA or the flute sonata form or a way of making light bulbs wear out in half the time. But most of them miss. Most people go through their lives without being hit by even one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some people are even more unfortunate. They get them <em class="calibre10">all.</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Such a one was Hwel. Enough inspirations to equip a complete history of the performing arts poured continuously into a small heavy skull designed by evolution to do nothing more spectacular than be remarkably resistant to axe blows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He licked his quill and looked bashfully around the camp. No-one was watching. He carefully lifted up the <em class="calibre10">Wizard</em> and revealed another stack of paper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was another potboiler. Every page was stained with sweat and the words themselves scrawled across the manuscript in a trellis of blots and crossings-out and tiny scribbled insertions. Hwel stared at it for a moment, alone in a world that consisted of him, the next blank page and the shouting, clamouring voices that haunted his dreams.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He began to write.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Free of Hwel's never-too-stringent attention. Tomjon pushed open the lid of the props hamper and, in the methodical way of the very young, began to unpack the crowns.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The dwarf stuck out his tongue as he piloted the errant quill across the ink-speckled page. He'd found room for the star-crossed lovers, the comic gravediggers and me hunchback king. It was the cats and the roller skates that were currently giving him trouble . . .</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A gurgle made him look up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'For goodness sake, lad,' he said. 'It hardly fits. Put it back.'</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Disc rolled into winter.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Winter in the Ramtops could not honestly be described as a magical frosty wonderland, each twig laced with confections of brittle ice. Winter in the Ramtops didn't mess about; it was a gateway straight through to the primeval coldness that lived before the creation of the world. Winter in the Ramtops was several yards of snow, the forests a mere collection of shadowy green tunnels under the drifts. Winter meant the coming of the lazy wind, which couldn't be bothered to blow around people and blew right through them instead. The idea that Winter could actually be enjoyable would never have occurred to Ramtop people, who had eighteen different words for snow<a href="#note_5" title="All of them, unfortunately, unprintable."><sup class="calibre11">[5]</sup></a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The ghost of King Verence prowled the battlements, bereft and hungry, and stared out across his beloved forests and waited his chance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a winter of portents. Comets sparkled against the chilled skies at night. Clouds shaped mightily like whales and dragons drifted over the land by day. In the village of Razorback a cat gave birth to a two-headed kitten, but since Greebo, by dint of considerable effort, was every male ancestor for the last thirty generations this probably wasn't all that portentous.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>However, in Bad Ass a cockerel laid an egg and had to put up with some very embarrassing personal questions. In Lancre town a man swore he'd met a man who had actually seen with his own eyes a tree get up and walk. There was a short sharp shower of shrimps. There were odd lights in the sky. Geese walked backwards. Above all of this flared the great curtains of cold fire that were the Aurora Coriolis, the Hublights, whose frosty tints illuminated and coloured the midnight snows.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was nothing the least unusual about any of this. The Ramtops, which as it were lay across the Disc's vast magical standing wave like an iron bar dropped innocently across a pair of subway rails, were so saturated with magic that it was constantly discharging itself into the environment. People would wake up in the middle of the night, mutter, 'Oh, it's just another bloody portent', and go back to sleep.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hogswatchnight came round, marking the start of another year. And, with alarming suddenness, nothing happened.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The skies were clear, the snow deep and crisped like icing sugar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The freezing forests were silent and smelled of tin. The only things that fell from the sky were the occasional fresh showers of snow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A man walked across the moors from Razorback to Lancre town without seeing a single marshlight, headless dog, strolling tree, ghostly coach or comet, and had to be taken in by a tavern and given a drink to unsteady his nerves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The stoicism of the Ramtoppers, developed over the years as a sovereign resistance to the thaumaturgical chaos, found itself unable to cope with the sudden change. It was like a noise which isn't heard until it stops.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax heard it now as she lay snug under a pile of quilts in her freezing bedroom. Hogswatchnight is, traditionally, the one night of the Disc's long year when witches are expected to stay at home, and she'd had an early night in the company of a bag of apples and a stone hotwater bottle. But something had awoken her from her doze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>An ordinary person would have crept downstairs, possibly armed with a poker. Granny simply hugged her knees and let her mind wander.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It hadn't been in the house. She could feel the small, fast minds of mice, and the fuzzy minds of her goats as they lay in their cosy flatulence in the outhouse. A hunting owl was a sudden dagger of alertness as it glided over the rooftops.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny concentrated harder, until her mind was full of the tiny chittering of the insects in the thatch and the woodworm in the beams. Nothing of interest there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She snuggled down and let herself drift out into the forest, which was silent except for the occasional muffled thump as snow slid off a tree. Even in midwinter the forest was full of life, usually dozing in burrows or hibernating in the middle of trees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>All as usual. She spread herself further, to the high moors and secret passes where the wolves ran silently over the frozen crust; she touched their minds, sharp as knives. Higher still, and there was nothing in the snowfields but packs of vermine<a href="#note_6" title="The vermine is a small black and white furry creature, much famed for its pelt. It is a more careful relative of the lemming; it only throws itself over small pebbles."><sup class="calibre11">[6]</sup></a>.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Everything was as it should be, with the exception that nothing was right. There was something – yes, there was something <em class="calibre10">alive</em> out there, something young and ancient and . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned over the feeling in her mind. Yes. That was it. Something forlorn. Something lost. And . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Feelings were never simple, Granny knew. Strip them away and there were others underneath . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Something that, if it didn't stop feeling lost and forlorn very soon, was going to get <em class="calibre10">angry.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And still she couldn't find it. She could feel the tiny minds of chrysalises down under the frozen leafmould. She could sense the earthworms, which had migrated below the frost line. She could even sense a few people, who were hardest of all – human minds were thinking so many thoughts all at the same time that they were nearly impossible to locate; it was like trying to nail fog to the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nothing there. Nothing there. The feeling was all around her, and there was nothing to cause it. She'd gone down about as far as she could, to the smallest creature in the kingdom, and there was nothing there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax sat up in bed, lit a candle and reached for an apple. She glared at her bedroom wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She didn't like being beaten. There was something out there, something drinking in magic, something growing, something dial seemed so alive it was all around the house, and she couldn't find it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She reduced the apple to its core and placed it carefully in the tray of the candlestick. Then she blew out the candle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The cold velvet of the night slid back into the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny had one last try. Perhaps she was looking in the wrong way . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A moment later she was lying on the floor with the pillow clasped around her head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And to think she had expected it to be <em class="calibre10">small . . .</em></span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lancre Castle shook. It wasn't a violent shaking, but it didn't need to be, the construction of the castle being such that it swayed slightly even in a gentle breeze. A small turret toppled slowly into the depths of the misty canyon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool lay on his flagstones and shivered in his sleep. He appreciated the honour, if it was an honour, but sleeping in the corridor always made him dream of the Fools' Guild, behind whose severe grey walls he had trembled his way through seven years of terrible tuition. The flagstones were slightly softer than the beds there, though.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A few feet away a suit of armour jingled gently. Its pike vibrated in its mailed glove until, swishing through the night air like a swooping bat, it slid down and shattered the flagstone by the Fool's ear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool sat up and realised he was still shivering. So was the floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In Lord Felmet's room the shaking sent cascades of dust down from the ancient four-poster. He awoke from a dream that a great beast was tramping around the castle, and decided with horror that it might be true.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A portrait of some long-dead king fell off the wall. The duke screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool stumbled in, trying to keep his balance on a floor that was now heaving like the sea, and the duke staggered out of bed and grabbed the little man by his jerkin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's happening?' he hissed. 'Is it an earthquake?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We don't have them in these parts, my lord,' said the Fool, and was knocked aside as a chaise-longue drifted slowly across the carpet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke dashed to the window, and looked out at the forests in the moonlight. The white-capped trees shook in the still night air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A slab of plaster crashed on to the floor. Lord Felmet spun around and this time his grip lifted the Fool a foot off the floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Among the very many luxuries the duke had dispensed with in his life was that of ignorance. He liked to feel he knew what was going on. The glorious uncertainties of existence held no attraction for him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's the witches, isn't it?' he growled, his left cheek beginning to twitch like a landed fish. They're out there, aren't they? They're putting an Influence on the castle, aren't they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, nuncle—' the Fool began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They run this country, don't they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, my lord, they've never—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'<em class="calibre10">Who asked you?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool was trembling with fear in perfect anti-phase to the castle, so that he was the only thing that now appeared to be standing perfectly still.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Er, you did, my lord,' he quavered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you arguing with me?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, my lord!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought so. You're in league with them, I suppose?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My lord!' said the Fool, really shocked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're all in league, you people!' the duke snarled. 'The whole bunch of you! You're nothing but a pack of ringleaders!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He flung the Fool aside and thrust the tall windows open, striding out into the freezing night air. He glared out over the sleeping kingdom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you all hear me?' he screamed. 'I am the king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The shaking stopped, catching the duke off-balance. He steadied himself quickly, and brushed the plaster dust off his nightshirt.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right, then,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But this was worse. Now the forest was listening. The words he spoke vanished into a great vacuum of silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was something out there. He could feel it. It was strong enough to shake the castle, and now it was watching him, listening to him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke backed away, very carefully, fumbling behind him for the window catch. He stepped carefully into the room, shut the windows and hurriedly pulled the curtains across.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am the king,' he repeated, quietly. He looked at the Fool, who felt that something was expected of him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The man is my lord and master, he thought. I have eaten his salt, or whatever all that business was. They told me at Guild school that a Fool should be faithful to his master until the very end, after all others have deserted him. Good or bad doesn't come into it. Every leader needs his Fool. There is only loyalty. That's the whole thing. Even if he is clearly three-parts bonkers, I'm his Fool until one of us dies.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>To his horror he realised the duke was weeping.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool fumbled in his sleeve and produced a rather soiled red and yellow handkerchief embroidered with bells. The duke took it with an expression of pathetic gratitude and blew his nose. Then he held it away from him and gazed at it with demented suspicion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is this a dagger I see before me?' he mumbled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Um. No, my lord. It's my handkerchief, you see. You can sort of tell the difference if you look closely. It doesn't have as many sharp edges.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Good</span>
        </em>
        <span> fool,' said the duke, vaguely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Totally mad, the Fool thought. Several bricks short of a bundle. So far round the twist you could use him to open wine bottles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Kneel beside me, my Fool.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool did so. The duke laid a soiled bandage on his shoulder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you loyal, Fool?' he said. 'Are you trustworthy?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I swore to follow my lord until death,' said the Fool hoarsely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke pressed his mad face close to the Fool, who looked up into a pair of bloodshot eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't want to,' he hissed conspiratorially. 'They made me do it. I didn't want—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The door swung open. The duchess filled the doorway. In fact, she was nearly the same shape.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Leonal!' she barked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool was fascinated by what happened to the duke's eyes. The mad red flame vanished, was sucked backwards, and was replaced by the hard blue stare he had come to recognise. It didn't mean, he realised, that the duke was any less mad. Even the coldness of his sanity was madness in a way. The duke had a mind that ticked like a clock and, like a clock, it regularly went cuckoo.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lord Felmet looked up calmly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, my dear?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What is the meaning of all this?' she demanded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Witches, I suspect,' said Lord Felmet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I really don't think—' the Fool began. Lady Felmet's glare didn't merely silence him, it almost nailed him to the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That is clearly apparent,' she said. 'You are an idiot.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A Fool, my lady.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'As well,' she added, and turned back to her husband.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So,' she said, smiling grimly. 'Still they defy you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke shrugged. 'How should I fight magic?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'With words,' said the Fool, without thinking, and was instantly sorry. They were both staring at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool dropped his mandolin in his embarrassment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'In – in the Guild,' said the Fool, 'we learned that words can be more powerful even than magic.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Clown!' said the duke. 'Words are just words. Brief syllables. Sticks and stones may break my bones—' he paused, savouring the thought – 'but words can never hurt me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My lord, there are such words that can,' said the Fool. 'Liar! Usurper! Murderer!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke jerked back and gripped the arms of the throne, wincing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Such words have no truth,' said the Fool, hurriedly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But they can spread like fire underground, breaking out to burn—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's true! It's true!' screamed the duke. 'I hear them, all the time!' He leaned forward. 'It's the witches!' he hissed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then, then, then they can be fought with other words,' said the Fool, 'Words can fight even witches,'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What words?' said the duchess, thoughtfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool shrugged. 'Crone. Evil eye. Stupid old woman.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess raised one thick eyebrow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You are not entirely an idiot, are you,' she said. 'You refer to rumour.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just so, my lady.' The Fool rolled his eyes. What had he got himself into?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's the witches,' whispered the duke, to no-one in particular. 'We must tell the world about the witches. They're evil. They make it come back, the blood. Even sandpaper doesn't work.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another tremor as Granny Weatherwax hurried along the narrow, frozen pathways in the forest. A lump of snow slipped off a tree branch and poured over her hat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This wasn't right, she knew. Never mind about the -whatever it was – but it was unheard of for a witch to go out on Hogswatchnight. It was against all tradition. No-one knew why, but that wasn't the point.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She came out on to the moorland and pounded across the brittle heather, which had been scoured of snow by the wind. There was a crescent moon near the horizon, and its pale glow lit up the mountains that towered over her. It was a different world up there, and one even a witch would rarely venture into; it was a landscape left over from the frosty birth of the world, all green ice and knife-edge ridges and deep, secret valleys. It was a landscape never intended for human beings – not hostile, any more than a brick or cloud is hostile, but terribly, terribly uncaring.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Except that, this time, it was watching her. A mind quite unlike any other she had ever encountered was giving her a great deal of its attention. She glared up at the icy slopes, half expecting to see a mountainous shadow move against the stars.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who are you?' she shouted. 'What do you want?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Her voice bounced and echoed among the rocks. There was a distant boom of an avalanche, high among the peaks.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On the crest of the moor, where in the summer partridges lurked among the bushes like small whirring idiots, was a standing stone. It stood roughly where the witches' territories met, although the boundaries were never formally marked out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The stone was about the same height as a tall man, and made of bluish tinted rock. It was considered intensely magical because, although there was only one of it, <em class="calibre10">no-one had ever been able to count if,</em> if it saw anyone looking at it speculatively, it shuffled behind them. It was the most self-effacing monolith ever discovered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was also one of the numerous discharge points for the magic that accumulated in the Ramtops. The ground around it for several yards was bare of snow, and steamed gently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The stone began to edge away, and watched her suspiciously from behind a tree.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She waited for ten minutes until Magrat came hurrying up the path from Mad Stoat, a village whose good-natured inhabitants were getting used to ear massage and flower-based homeopathic remedies for everything short of actual decapitation<a href="#note_7" title="They worked. Witches' remedies generally did, regardless of the actual form of delivery."><sup class="calibre11">[7]</sup></a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She was out of breath, and wore only a shawl over a nightdress that, if Magrat had anything to reveal, would have been very revealing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You felt it too?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded. 'Where's Gytha?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They looked down the path that led to Lancre town, a huddle of lights in the snowy gloom.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a party going on. Light poured out into the street. A line of people were winding in and out of Nanny Ogg's house, from inside which came occasional shrieks of laughter and the sounds of breaking glass and children grizzling. It was clear that family life was being experienced to its limits in that house. The two witches stood uncertainly in the street.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you think we should go in?' said Magrat diffidently. 'It's not as though we were invited. And we haven't brought a bottle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sounds to me as if there's a deal too many bottles in there already,' said Granny Weatherwax disapprovingly. A man staggered out of the doorway, burped, bumped into Granny, said, 'Happy Hogswatchnight, missus,' glanced up at her face and sobered up instantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Mss,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> snapped Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am most frightfully sorry—' he began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny swept imperiously past him. 'Come, Magrat,' she commanded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The din inside hovered around the pain threshold. Nanny Ogg got around the Hogswatchnight tradition by inviting the whole village in, and the air in the room was already beyond the reach of pollution controls. Granny navigated through the press of bodies by the sound of a cracked voice explaining to the world at large that, compared to an unbelievable variety of other animals, the hedgehog was quite fortunate.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg was sitting in a chair by the fire with a quart mug in one hand, and was conducting the reprise with a cigar. She grinned when she saw Granny's face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What ho, my old boiler,' she screeched above the din. 'See you turned up, then. Have a drink. Have two. Wotcher, Magrat. Pull up a chair and call the cat a bastard.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo, who was curled up in the inglenook and watching the festivities with one slit yellow eye, flicked his tail once or twice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sat down stiffly, a ramrod figure of decency.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're not staying,' she said, glaring at Magrat, who was tentatively reaching out towards a bowl of peanuts. 'I can see you're busy. We just wondered whether you might have noticed – anything. Tonight. A little while ago.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg wrinkled her forehead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Our Darron's eldest was sick,' she said. 'Been at his dad's beer.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Unless he was <em class="calibre10">extremely</em> ill,' said Granny, 'I doubt if it was what I was referring to.' She made a complex occult sign in the air, which Nanny totally ignored.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Someone tried to danee on the table,' she said. 'Fell into our Reet's pumpkin dip. We had a good laugh.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny waggled her eyebrows and placed a meaningful finger alongside her nose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was alluding to things of a <em class="calibre10">different</em> nature,' she hinted darkly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg peered at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Something wrong with your eye, Esme?' she hazarded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Extremely worrying developments of a magical tendency are even now afoot,' she said loudly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The room went quiet. Everyone stared at the witches, except for Darron's eldest, who took advantage of the opportunity to continue his alcoholic experiments. Then, swiftly as they had fled, several dozen conversations hurriedly got back into gear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It might be a good idea if we can go and talk somewhere more private,' said Granny, as the comforting hubbub streamed over them again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They ended up in the washhouse, where Granny tried to give an account of the mind she had encountered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's out there somewhere, in the mountains and the high forests,' she said. 'And it is very big.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought it was looking for someone,' said Magrat. 'It put me in mind of a large dog. You know, lost. Puzzled.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny thought about this. Now she came to think of it . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' she said. 'Something like that. A <em class="calibre10">big</em> dog.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Worried,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Searching,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And getting angry,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Granny, staring fixedly at Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Could be a troll,' said Nanny Ogg. 'I left best part of a pint in there, you know,' she added reproachfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know what a troll's mind feels like, Gytha,' said Granny. She didn't snap the words out. In fact it was the quiet way she said them that made Nanny hesitate.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They say there's really big trolls up towards the Hub,' said Nanny slowly. 'And ice giants, and big hairy woss-names that live above the snowline. But you don't mean anything like that, do you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat shivered. She told herself that a witch had absolute control over her own body, and the goosepimples under her tun nightdress were just a figment of her own imagination. The trouble was, she had an excellent imagination.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We'd better have a look, then,' she said, and took the lid off the copper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg never used her washhouse., since all her washing was done by the daughers-in-law, a tribe of grey-faced, subdued women whose names she never bothered to remember. It had become, therefore, a storage place for dried-up old bulbs, burnt-out cauldrons and fermenting jars of wasp jam. No fire had been lit under the copper for ten years. Its bricks were crumbling, and rare ferns grew around the firebox. The water under the lid was inky black and, according to rumour, bottomless; the Ogg grandchildren were encouraged to believe that monsters from the dawn of time dwelt in its depths, since Nanny believed that a bit of thrilling and pointless terror was an essential ingredient of the magic of childhood.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In summer she used it as a beer cooler.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It'll have to do. I think perhaps we should join hands,' she said. 'And you, Magrat, make sure the door's shut.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you going to try?' said Granny. Since they were on Nanny's territory, the choice was entirely up to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I always say you can't go wrong with a good Invocation,' said Nanny. 'Haven't done one for years.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax frowned. Magrat said, 'Oh, but you can't. Not here. You need a cauldron, and a magic sword. And an octogram. And spices, and all sorts of stuff.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny and Nanny exchanged glances.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not her fault,' said Granny. 'It's all them grimmers she was bought.' She turned to Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You don't need none of that,' she said. </span>'You need head-ology.' She looked around the ancient washroom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You just use whatever you've got,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She picked up the bleached copper stick, and weighed it thoughtfully in her hand.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'<em class="calibre10">We conjure and abjure thee by means of this—</em>' Granny hardly paused – 'sharp and terrible copper stick.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The waters in the boiler rippled gently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'See how we scatter—'</span>
        </em>
        <span> Magrat sighed – 'rather old washing soda and some extremely hard soap flakes in thy honour. Really, Nanny, I don't think—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Silence! Now you, Gytha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'And I invoke and bind thee</span>
        </em>
        <span> with the balding scrubbing brush of Art and the washboard of Protection,' said Nanny, waving it. The wringer attachment fell off.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Honesty is all very well,' whispered Magrat, wretchedly, 'but somehow it isn't the same.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You listen to me, my girl,' said Granny. 'Demons don't care about the outward shape of things. It's what <em class="calibre10">you</em> think that matters. Get on with it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat tried to imagine that the bleached and ancient bar of lye soap was the rarest of scented whatever, ungulants or whatever they were, from distant Klatch. It was an effort. The gods alone knew what kind of demon would respond to a summoning like this.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny was also a little uneasy. She didn't much care for demons in any case, and all this business with incantations and implements whiffed of wizardry. It was pandering to the things, making them feel important. Demons ought to come when they were called.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But protocol dictated that the host witch had the choice, and Nanny quite liked demons, who were male, or apparently so. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At this point Granny was alternately cajoling and threatening the nether world with two feet of bleached wood. She was impressed at her own daring.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The waters seethed a little, became very still and then, with a sudden movement and a little popping noise, mounded up into a head. Magrat dropped her soap.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a good-looking head, maybe a little cruel around the eyes and beaky about the nose-, but nevertheless handsome in a hard kind of way. There was nothing surprising about this; since the demon was only extending an image of itself into this reality, it might as well make a good job of it. It turned slowly, a gleaming black statue in the fitful moonlight.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Well?'</span>
        </em>
        <span> it said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who're you?' said Granny, bluntly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The head revolved to face her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'My name is unpronounceable in your tongue, woman,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> it said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll be the judge of that,' warned Granny, and added, 'Don't you call me woman.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Very well. My name is WxrtHltl-jwlpklz,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the demon smugly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where were you when the vowels were handed out? Behind the door?' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, Mr— Granny hesitated only fractionally – 'WxrtHltl-jwlpklz, I expect you're wondering why we called you here tonight.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'<em class="calibre10">You're not supposed to say that,'</em> said the demon. ' <em class="calibre10">You're supposed to say—'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shut up. We have the sword of Art and the octogram of Protection, I warn you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Please yourself. They look like a washboard and a copper stick to me,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> sneered the demon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny glanced sideways. The corner of the washroom was stacked with kindling wood, with a big heavy sawhorse in front of it. She stared fixedly at the demon and, without looking, brought the stick down hard across the, thick timber.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dead silence that followed was broken only by the two perfectly-sliced halves of the sawhorse teetering backwards and forwards and folding slowly into the heap of kindling.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The demon's face remained impassive.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'You are allowed three questions,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> it said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is there something strange at large in the kingdom?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It appeared to think about it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And no lying,' said Magrat earnestly. 'Otherwise it'll be the scrubbing brush for you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'You mean stranger than usual?'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Get on with it,' said Nanny. 'My feet are freezing out here.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'No. There is nothing strange.'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we felt it—' Magrat began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hold on, hold on,' said Granny. Her lips moved soundlessly. Demons were like genies or philosophy professors — if you didn't word things <em class="calibre10">exactly</em> right, they delighted in giving you absolutely accurate and completely misleading answers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is there something in the kingdom that wasn't there before?' she hazarded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tradition said that there could be only three questions. Granny tried to formulate one that couldn't be deliberately misunderstood. Then she decided that this was playing the wrong kind of game.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What the hell's going on?' she said carefully. 'And no mucking about trying to wriggle out of it, otherwise I'll boil you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The demon appeared to hesitate. This was obviously a new approach.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Magrat, just kick that kindling over here, will you?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'I protest at this treatment,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the demon, its voice tinged with uncertainty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, well, we haven't got time to bandy legs with you all night,' said Granny. These word games might be all right for wizards, but we've got other fish to fry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Or boil,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Look,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the demon, and now there was a whine of terror in its voice. '<em class="calibre10">We're not supposed to volunteer information just like that. There are rules, you know.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's some old oil in the can on the shelf, Magrat,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'<em class="calibre10">If I simply tell you—'</em> the demon began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' said Granny, encouragingly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'You won't let on, will you?'</span>
        </em>
        <span> it implored.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not a word,' promised Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lips are sealed,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'There is nothing new in the kingdom,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the demon, <em class="calibre10">'but the land has woken up.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What do you mean?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'It's unhappy. It wants a king that cares for it.'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How—' Magrat began, but Granny waved her into silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You don't mean people, do you?' she said. The glistening head shook. 'No, I didn't think so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What—' Nanny began. Granny put a finger to her lips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned and walked to the washhouse's window, a dusty spiderweb graveyard of faded butterfly wings and last summer's bluebottles. A faint glow beyond the frosted panes suggested that, against all reason, a new day would soon dawn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can you tell us why?' she said, without turning round. She'd felt the mind of a whole country . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She was rather impressed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'I'm just a demon. What do I know? Only what is, not the why and how of it.'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I see.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'May I go now?'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Um?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Please?'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny jerked upright again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. Yes. Run along,' she said distractedly. 'Thank you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The head didn't move. It hung around, like a hotel porter who has just carried fifteen suitcases up ten flights of stairs, shown everyone where the bathroom is, plumped up the pillows, and feels he has adjusted all the curtains he is going to adjust.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'<em class="calibre10">You wouldn't mind banishing me, would you?'</em> said the demon, when no-one seemed to be taking the hint.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said Granny, who was thinking again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Only I'd feel better for being properly banished. "Run along" lacks that certain something,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. Well, if it gives you any pleasure. Magrat!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' said Magrat, startled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny tossed the copper stick to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do the honours, will you?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat caught the stick by what she hoped Granny was imagining as the handle, and smiled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly. Right. Okay. Um. Begone, foul fiend, unto the blackest pit—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The head smiled contentedly as the words rolled over it. This was more like it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It melted back into the waters of the copper like candlewax under a flame. Its last contemptuous comment, almost lost in the swirl, was, <em class="calibre10">'Run aaaalonggg ...'</em></span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny went home alone as the cold pink light of dawn glided across the snow, and let herself into her cottage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The goats were uneasy in their outhouse. The starlings muttered and rattled their false teeth under the roof. The mice were squeaking behind the kitchen dresser.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She made a pot of tea, conscious that every sound in the kitchen seemed slightly louder than it ought to be. When she dropped the spoon into the sink it sounded like a bell being hit with a hammer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She always felt uncomfortable after getting involved in organised magic or, as she would put it, out of sorts with herself. She found herself wandering around the place looking for things to do and then forgetting them when they were half-complete. She paced back and forth across the cold flagstones.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It is at times like this that the mind finds the oddest jobs to do in order to avoid its primary purpose, i.e., thinking about things. If anyone had been watching they would have been amazed at the sheer dedication with which Granny tackled such tasks as cleaning the teapot stand, rooting ancient nuts out of the fruit bowl on the dresser, and levering fossilised bread crusts out of the cracks in the flagstones with the back of a teaspoon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Animals had minds. People had minds, although human minds were vague foggy things. Even insects had minds, little pointy bits of light in the darkness of non-mind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny considered herself something of an expert on minds. She was pretty certain things like countries didn't have minds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They weren't even <em class="calibre10">alive,</em> for goodness sake. A country was, well, was—</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hold on. Hold on ... A thought stole gently into Granny's mind and sheepishly tried to attract her attention.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a way in which those brooding forests could have a mind. Granny sat up, a piece of antique loaf in her hand, and gazed speculatively at the fireplace. Her mind's eye looked through it, out at the snow-filled aisles of trees. Yes. It had never occurred to her before. Of course, it'd be a mind made up of all the other little minds inside it; plant minds, bird minds, bear minds, even the great slow minds of the trees themselves . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She sat down in her rocking chair, which started to rock all by itself.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She'd often thought of the forest as a sprawling creature, but only metterforicaily, as a wizard would put it; drowsy and purring with bumblebees in the summer, roaring and raging in autumn gales, curled in on itself and sleeping in the winter. It occurred to her that in addition to being a collection of other things, the forest was a thing in itself. Alive, only not alive in the way that, say, a shrew was alive.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And <em class="calibre10">much slower.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>That would have to be important. How fast did a forest's heart beat? Once a year, maybe. Yes, that sounded about right. Out there the forest was waiting for the brighter sun and longer days that would pump a million gallons of sap several hundred feet into the sky in one great systolic thump too big and loud to be heard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And it was at about this point that Granny bit her lip.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She'd just thought the word 'systolic', and it certainly wasn't in her vocabulary.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Somebody was inside her head with her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Some thing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Had she just thought all those thoughts, or had they been thought <em class="calibre10">through</em> her?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She glared at the floor, trying to keep her ideas to herself. But her mind was being watched as easily as if her head was made of glass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax got to her feet and opened the curtains.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And they were out there on what – in warmer months -was the lawn. And every single one of them was staring at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a few minutes Granny's front door opened. This was an event in its own right; like most Ramtoppers Granny lived her life via the back door. There were only three times in your life when it was proper to come through the front door, and you were carried every time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It opened with considerable difficulty, in a series of painful jerks and thumps. A few flakes of paint fell on to the snowdrift in front of the door, which sagged inward. Finally, when it was about halfway open, the door wedged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny sidled awkwardly through the gap and out on to the hitherto undisturbed snow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She had put her pointed hat on, and the long black cloak which she wore when she wanted anyone who saw her to be absolutely clear that she was a witch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was an elderly kitchen chair half buried in snow. In summer it was a handy place to sit and do whatever hand chores were necessary, while keeping one eye on the track. Granny hauled it out, brushed the snow off the seat, and sat down firmly with her knees apart and her arms folded defiantly. She stuck out her chin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sun was well up but the light on this Hogswatchday was still pink and slanting. It glowed on the great cloud of steam that hung over the assembled creatures. They hadn't moved, although every now and again one of them would stamp a hoof or scratch itself.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked up at a flicker of movement. She hadn't noticed before, but every tree around her garden was so heavy with birds that it looked as though a strange brown and black spring had come early.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Occupying the patch where the herbs grew in summer were the wolves, sitting or lolling with their tongues hanging out. A contingent of bears was crouched behind them, with a platoon of deer beside them. Occupying the metterforical stalls was a rabble of rabbits, weasels, vermine, badgers, foxes and miscellaneous creatures who, despite the fact that they live their entire lives in a bloody atmosphere of hunter and hunted, killing or being killed by claw, talon and tooth, are generally referred to as woodland folk.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They rested together on the snow, their normal culinary relationships entirely forgotten, trying to outstare her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Two things were immediately apparent to Granny. One was that this seemed to represent a pretty accurate cross-section of the forest life.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other she couldn't help saying aloud.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know what this spell is,' she said. 'But I'll tell you this for nothing – when it wears off, some of you little buggers had better get moving.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>None of them stirred. There was no sound except for an elderly badger relieving itself with an embarrassed expression.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look,' said Granny. 'What can I do about it? It's no good you coming to me. He's the new lord. This is his kingdom. I can't go meddling. It's not <em class="calibre10">right</em> to go meddling, on account of I can't interfere with people ruling. It has to sort itself out, good or bad. Fundamental rule of magic, is that. You can't go round ruling people with spells, because you'd have to use more and more spells all the time.' She sat back, grateful that long-standing tradition didn't allow the Crafty and the Wise to rule. She remembered what it had felt like to wear the crown, even for a few seconds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No, things like crowns had a troublesome effect on clever folk; it was best to leave all the reigning to the kind of people whose eyebrows met in the middle when they tried to think. In a funny sort of way, they were much better at it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She added, 'People have to sort it out for themselves. Well-known fact.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She felt that one of the larger stags was giving her a particularly doubting look.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, well, so he killed the old king,' she conceded. That's nature's way, ain't it? Your lot know all about this. Survival of the wossname. You wouldn't know what an heir was, unless you thought it was a sort of rabbit.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She drummed her fingers on her knees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway, the old king wasn't much of a friend to you, was he? All that hunting, and such.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Three hundred pairs of dark eyes bored in at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's no good you all looking at me,' she tried. 'I can't go around mucking about with kings just because you don't like them. Where would it all end? It's not as if he's done me any harm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She tried to avoid the gaze of a particularly cross-eyed stoat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right, so it's selfish,' she said. 'That's what bein' a witch is all about. Good day to you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stamped inside, and tried to slam the door. It stuck once or twice, which rather spoiled the effect.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Once inside she drew the curtains and sat down in the rocking chair and rocked fiercely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's the whole point,' she said. 'I can't go around meddling. That's the whole point.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The lattys lurched slowly over the rutted roads, towards yet another little city whose name the company couldn't quite remember and would instantly forget. The winter sun hung low over the damp, misty cabbage fields of the Sto Plains, and the foggy silence magnified the creaking of the wheels.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel sat with his stubby legs dangling over the backboard of the last latty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd done his best. Vitoller had left the education of Tomjon in his hands; 'You're better at all that business,' he'd said, adding with his usual tact, 'Besides, you're more his height.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But it wasn't working.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Apple,' he repeated, waving the fruit in the air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon grinned at him. He was nearly three years old, and hadn't said a word anyone could understand. Hwel was harbouring dark suspicions about the witches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But he seems bright enough,' said Mrs Vitoller, who was travelling inside the latty and darning the chain mail. 'He knows what things are. He does what he's told. I just wish you'd speak,' she said softly, patting the boy on the cheek.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel gave the apple to Tomjon, who accepted it gravely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I reckon them witches did you a bad turn, missus,' said the dwarf. 'You know. Changelings and whatnot. There used to be a lot of that sort of thing. My great-great-grandmother said it was done to us, once. The fairies swapped a human and a dwarf. We never realised until he started banging his head on things, they say—'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">'They say this fruit be like unto the world</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So sweet. Or like, say I, the heart of man</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So red without and yet within, unclue'd,</div>
      <div class="paragraph">We find the worm, the rot, the flaw.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">However glows his bloom the bite</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Proves many a man be rotten at the core.'</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two of them swivelled around to stare at Tomjon, who nodded to them and proceeded to eat the apple.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That was the Worm speech from <em class="calibre10">The Tyrant,'</em> whispered Hwel. His normal grasp of the language temporarily deserted him. 'Bloody hell,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But he sounded just like—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm going to get Vitoller,' said Hwel, and dropped off the tailboard and ran through the frozen puddles to the front of die convoy, where the actor-manager was whistling tunelessly and, yes, strolling.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What ho, <em class="calibre10">b'zugda-hiara</em><a href="#note_8" title="A killing insult in Dwarfish, but here used as a term of endearment. It means 'lawn ornament'."><sup class="calibre11">[8]</sup></a></span>
        <span>,' he said cheerfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've got to come at once! He's talking!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Talking?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel jumped up and down. 'He's <em class="calibre10">quoting!'</em> he shouted. 'You've got to come! He sounds just like—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Me?' said Vitoller, a few minutes later, after they had pulled the lattys into a grove of leafless trees by the roadside. 'Do I sound like that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' chorused the company.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Young Willikins, who specialised in female roles, prodded Tomjon gently as he stood on an upturned barrel in the middle of the clearing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here, boy, do you know my speech from <em class="calibre10">Please Yourself!'</em> he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nodded. ' "He is not dead, I say, who lies beneath the stone. For if Death could but hear—" '</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They listened in awed silence as the endless mists rolled across the dripping fields and the red ball of the sun floated down the sky. When the boy had finished hot tears were streaming down Hwel's face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'By all the gods,' he said, when Tomjon had finished, 'I must have been on damn good form when I wrote that.' He blew his nose noisily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do I sound like that?' said Willikins, his face pale.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller patted him gently on the shoulder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you sounded like that, my bonny,' he said, 'you wouldn't be standing arse-deep in slush in the middle of these forsaken fields, with nothing but liberated cabbage for thy tea.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He clapped his hands.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No more, no more,' he said, his breath making puffs of steam in the freezing air. 'Backs to it, everybody. We must be outside the walls of Sto Lat by sunset.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>As the grumbling actors awoke from the spell and wandered back to the shafts of the lattys Vitoller beckoned to the dwarf and put his arm around his shoulders, or rather around the top of his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well?' he said. 'You people know all about magic, or so it is said. What do you make of it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He spends all his time around the stage, master. It's only natural that he should pick things up,' said Hwel vaguely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller leaned down.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you believe that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I believe I heard a voice that took my doggerel and shaped it and fired it back through my ears and straight into my heart,' said Hwel simply. 'I believe I heard a voice that got behind the crude shape of the words and said the things I had meant them to say, but had not the skill to achieve. Who knows where such things come from?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stared impassively into Vitoller's red face. 'He may have inherited it from his father,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But-'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And who knows what witches may achieve?' said the dwarf.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller felt his wife's hand pushed into his. As he stood up, bewildered and angry, she kissed him on the back of the neck.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't torture yourself,' she said. 'Isn't it all for the best? Your son has declaimed his first word.'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Spring came, and ex-King Verence still wasn't taking being dead lying down. He prowled the castle relentlessly, seeking for a way in which its ancient stones would release their grip on him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was also trying to keep out of the way of the other ghosts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Champot was all right, if a bit tiresome. But Verence had backed away at the first sight of the Twins, toddling hand in hand along the midnight corridors, their tiny ghosts a memorial to a deed darker even than the usual run of regicidal unpleasantness.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then there was the Troglodyte Wanderer, a rather faded monkeyman in a furry loincloth who apparently happened to haunt the castle merely because it had been built on his burial mound. For no obvious reason a chariot with a screaming woman in it occasionally rumbled through the laundry room. As for the kitchen . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>One day he'd given in, despite everything old Champot had said, and had followed the smells of cooking into the big, hot, high domed cavern that served the castle as kitchen and abattoir. Funny thing, that. He'd never been down there since his childhood. Somehow kings and kitchens didn't go well together.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was <em class="calibre10">full</em> of ghosts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But they weren't human. They weren't even proto-human.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They were stags. They were bullocks. They were rabbits, and pheasants, and partridges, and sheep, and pigs. There were even some round blobby things that looked unpleasantly like the ghosts of oysters. They were packed so tightly that in fact they merged and mingled, turning the kitchen into a silent, jostling nightmare of teeth and fur and horns, half-seen and misty. Several noticed him, and there was a weird blarting of noises that sounded far-off, tinny and unpleasantly out of register. Through them all the cook and his assistants wandered quite unconcernedly, making vegetarian sausages.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence had stared for half a minute and then fled, wishing that he still had a real stomach so that he could stick his fingers down his throat for forty years and bring up everything he'd eaten.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd sought solace in the stables, where his beloved hunting dogs had whined and scratched at the door and had generally been very ill-at-ease at his sensed but unseen presence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Now he haunted – and how he hated the word – the Long Gallery, where paintings of long-dead kings looked down at him from the dusty shadows. He would have felt a lot more kindly towards them if he hadn't met a number of them gibbering in various parts of the premises.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence had decided that he had two aims in death. One was to get out of the castle and find his son, and the other was to get his revenge on the duke. But not by killing him, he'd decided, even if he could find a way, because an eternity in that giggling idiot's company would lend a new terror to death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He sat under a painting of Queen Bemery (670-722), whose rather stern good looks he would have felt a whole lot happier about if he hadn't seen her earlier that morning walking through the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence tried to avoid walking through walls. A man had his dignity.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He became aware that he was being watched.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He turned his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a cat sitting in the doorway, subjecting him to a slow blink. It was a mottled grey and extremely fat . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No. It was extremely <em class="calibre10">big.</em> It was covered with so much scar tissue that it looked like a fist with fur on it. Its ears were a couple of perforated stubs, its eyes two yellow slits of easygoing malevolence, its tail a twitching series of question marks as it stared at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo had heard that Lady Felmet had a small white female cat and had strolled up to pay his respects.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence had never seen an animal with so much built-in villainy. He didn't resist as it waddled across the floor and tried to rub itself against his legs, purring like a waterfall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, well,' said the king, vaguely. He reached down and made an effort to scratch it behind the two ragged bits on top of its head. It was a relief to find someone else besides another ghost who could see him, and Greebo, he couldn't help feeling, was a distinctly unusual cat. Most of the castle cats were either pampered pets or flat-eared kitchen and stable habitue's who generally resembled the very rodents they lived on. This cat, on the other hand, was its own animal. All cats give that impression, of course, but instead of the mindless animal self-absorption that passes for secret wisdom in the creatures. Greebo radiated genuine intelligence. He also radiated a smell that would have knocked over a wall and caused sinus trouble in a dead fox.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Only one type of person kept a cat like this.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The king tried to hunker down, and found he was sinking slightly into the floor. He pulled himself together and drifted upwards. Once a man allowed himself to go native in the ethereal world there would be no hope for him, he felt.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Only close relatives and the psychically inclined, Death had said. There weren't many of either in the castle. The duke qualified under the first heading, but his relentless self-interest made him about as psychically useful as a carrot. As for the rest, only the cook and the Fool seemed to qualify, but the cook spent a lot of his time weeping in the pantry because he wasn't being allowed to roast anything more bloody than a parsnip and the Fool was already such a bundle of nerves that Verence had given up his attempts to get through.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A witch, now. If a witch wasn't psychically inclined, then he, King Verence, was a puff of wind. He had to get a witch into the castle. And then . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd got a plan. In fact, it was more than that; it was a Plan. He spent months over it. He hadn't got anything else to do, except think. Death had been right about that. All that ghosts had were thoughts, and although thoughts in general had always been alien to the king the absence of any body to distract him with its assorted humours had actually given him the chance to savour the joys of cerebration. He'd never had a Plan before, or at least one that went much further than 'Let's find something and kill it'. And here, sitting in front of him washing itself, was the key.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here, pussy,' he ventured. Greebo gave him a penetrating yellow stare.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cat,' the king amended hastily, and backed away, beckoning. For a moment it seemed that the cat wouldn't follow and then, to his relief, Greebo stood up, yawned, and padded towards him. Greebo didn't often see ghosts, and was vaguely interested in this tall, bearded man with the see-through body.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The king led him along a dusty side corridor and towards a lumber room crammed with crumbling tapestries and portraits of long-dead kings. Greebo examined it critically, and then sat down in the middle of the dusty floor, looking at the king expectantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's plenty of mice and things in here, d'you see,' said Verence. 'And the rain blows in through the broken window. Plus there's all these tapestries to sleep on.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry,' the king added, and turned to the door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This was what he had been working on all these months. When he was alive he had always taken a lot of care of his body, and since being dead he had taken care to preserve its shape. It was too easy to let yourself go and become all fuzzy around the edges; there were ghosts in the castle who were mere pale blobs. But Verence had wielded iron self-control and exercised – well, had thought hard about exercise – and fairly bulged with spectral muscles. Months of pumping ectoplasm had left him in better shape than he had ever been, apart from being dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then he'd started out small, with dust motes. The first one had nearly killed him<a href="#note_9" title="In a manner of speaking."><sup class="calibre11">[9]</sup></a></span>
        <span>, but he'd persevered and progressed to sand grains, then whole dried peas; he still didn't dare venture into the kitchens, but he had amused himself by oversalting Felmet's food a pinch at a time until he pulled himself together and told himself that poisoning wasn't honourable, even against vermin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Now he leaned all his weight on the door, and with every microgramme of his being forced himself to become as heavy as possible. The sweat of auto-suggestion dripped off his nose and vanished before it hit the floor. Greebo watched with interest as ghostly muscles moved on the king's arms like footballs mating.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The door began to move, creaked, then accelerated and hit the doorway with a thump. The latch clicked into place.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It bloody well had to work now, Verence told himself. He'd never be able to lift the latch by himself. But a witch would certainly come looking for her cat – wouldn't she?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In the hills beyond the castle the Fool lay on his stomach and stared into the depths of a little lake. A couple of trout stared back at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Somewhere on the Disc, reason told him, there must be someone more miserable than he was. He wondered who it was.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He hadn't asked to be a Fool, but it wouldn't have mattered if he had, because he couldn't recall anyone in his family ever listening to anything he said after Dad ran away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Certainly not Grandad. His earliest memory was of Grandad standing over him making him repeat the jokes by rote, and hammering home every punchline with his belt; it was thick leather, and the fact that it had bells on didn't improve things much.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Grandad was credited with seven official new jokes. He'd won the honorary cap and bells of the Grand Prix des Idiots Blithering at Ankh-Morpork four years in a row, which no-one else had ever done, and presumably they made him the funniest man who ever lived. He had worked hard at it, you had to give him that.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool recalled with a shudder how, at the age of six.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>he'd timidly approached the old man after supper with a joke he'd made up. It was about a duck.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had earned him the biggest thrashing of his life, which even then must have presented the old joker with a bit of a challenge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You will learn, my lad—' he recalled, with every sentence punctuated by jingling cracks – 'that there is nothing more serious than jesting. From now on you will never—' the old man paused to change hands – 'never, never, ever utter a joke that has not been approved by the Guild. Who are you to decide what is amusing? Marry, let the untutored giggle at unskilled banter; it is the laughter of the ignorant. Never. Never. Never let me catch you joculating again.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After that he'd gone back to learning the three hundred and eighty-three Guild-approved jokes, which was bad enough, and the glossary, which was a lot bigger and much worse.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then he'd been sent to Ankh, and there, in the bare, severe rooms, he'd found there were books other than the great heavy brass-bound <em class="calibre10">Monster Fun Book</em>. There was a whole circular world out there, full of weird places and people doing interesting things, like ... </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Singing. He could hear singing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He raised his head cautiously, and jumped at the tinkle of the bells on his cap. He gripped the hated things hurriedly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The singing went on. The Fool peeped cautiously through the drift of meadowsweet that was providing him with perfect concealment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The singing wasn't particularly good. The only word the singer appeared to know was 'la', but she was making it work hard. The general tune gave the impression that the singer believed that people were supposed to sing 'lalala' in certain circumstances, and was determined to do what the world expected of her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool risked raising his head a little further, and saw Magrat for the first time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She had stopped dancing rather self-consciously through the narrow meadow and was trying to plait some daisies in her hair, without much success.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool held his breath. On long nights on the hard flagstones he had dreamed of women like her. Although, if he really thought about it, not much like her; they were better endowed around the chest, their noses weren't so red and pointed, and their hair tended to flow more. But the Fool's libido was bright enough to tell the difference between the impossible and the conceivably attainable, and hurriedly cut in some filter circuits.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was picking flowers and talking to them. The Fool strained to hear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here's Woolly Fellwort,' she said. 'And Treacle Worm-seed, which is for inflammation of the ears . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even Nanny Ogg, who took a fairly cheerful view of the world, would have been hard put to say anything complimentary about Magrat's voice. But it fell on the Fool's ears like blossom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'... </span>and Five-leaved False Mandrake, sovereign against fluxes of the bladder. <span>Ah, and here's Old Man's Frogbit. That's for constipation.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool stood up sheepishly, in a carillon of jingles. To Magrat it was as if the meadow, hitherto supporting nothing more hazardous than clouds of pale blue butterflies and a few self-employed bumblebees, had sprouted a large red-and-yellow demon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was opening and shutting its mouth. It had three menacing horns.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>An urgent voice at the back of her mind said: You should run away now, like a timid gazelle; this is the accepted action in these circumstances.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Common sense intervened. In her most optimistic moments Magrat would not have compared herself to a gazelle, timid or otherwise. Besides, it added, the basic snag about running away like a timid gazelle was that in all probability she would easily outdistance him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Er,' said the apparition.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Uncommon sense, which, despite Granny Weatherwax's general belief that Magrat was several sticks short of a bundle, she still had in sufficiency, pointed out that few demons tinkled pathetically and appeared to be quite so breathless.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hallo,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool's mind was also working hard. He was beginning to panic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat shunned the traditional pointed hat, as worn by the older witches, but she still held to one of the most iundamental rules of witchcraft. It's not much use being a witch unless you look like one. In her case this meant lots of silver jewellery with octograms, bats, spiders, dragons and other symbols of everyday mysticism; Magrat would have painted her fingernails black, except that she didn't think she would be able to face Granny's withering scorn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was dawning on the Fool that he had surprised a witch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whoops,' he said, and turned to run for it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't—' Magrat began, but the Fool was already pounding down the forest path that led back to the castle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat stood and stared at the wilting posy in her hands. She ran her fingers through her hair and a shower of wilted petals fell out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She felt that an important moment had been allowed to slip out of her grasp as fast as a greased pig in a narrow passageway.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She felt an overpowering urge to curse. She knew a great many curses. Goodie Whemper had been really imaginative in that department; even the creatures of the forest used to go past her cottage at a dead run.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She couldn't find a single one that fully expressed her feelings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, bugger,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a full moon again that night, and most unusually all three witches arrived at the standing stone early; it was so embarrassed by this that it went and hid in some gorse bushes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Greebo hasn't been home for two days/ said Nanny Ogg, as soon as she arrived. 'It's not like him. I can't find him anywhere.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cats can look after themselves,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'Countries can't. I have intelligence to report. Light the fire, Magrat.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mmm?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, light the fire, Magrat.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mmm? Oh. Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two old women watched her drift vaguely across the moorland, tugging absently at dried-up whin clumps. Magrat seemed to have her mind on something.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Doesn't seem to be her normal self,' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. Could be an improvement,' said Granny shortly, and sat down on a rock. 'She should of got it lit before we arrived. It's her job.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She means well,' said Nanny Ogg, studying Magrat's back reflectively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I used to mean well when I was a girl, but that didn't stop the sharp end of Goodie Filter's tongue. Youngest witch serves her time, you know how it is. We had it tougher, too. Look at her. Doesn't even wear the pointy hat. How's anyone going to <em class="calibre10">know?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You got something on <em class="calibre10">your</em> mind, Esme?' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded gloomily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Had a visit yesterday,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Me too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Despite her worries, Granny was slightly annoyed at this. 'Who from?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The mayor of Lancre and a bunch of burghers. They're not happy about the king. They want a king they can trust.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wouldn't trust any king a burgher could trust,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but it's not good for anyone, all this taxing and killing folk. The new sergeant they've got is a keen man when it comes to setting fire to cottages, too. Old Verence used to do it too, mind, but . . . well . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know, I know. It was more personal,' said Granny. 'You felt he <em class="calibre10">meant</em> it. People like to feel they're valued.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This Felmet hates the kingdom,' Nanny went on. 'They all say it. They say when they go to talk to him he just stares at them and giggles and rubs his hand and twitches a bit.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny scratched her chin. 'The old king used to shout at them and kick them out of the castle, mind. He used to say he didn't have no time for shopkeepers and such,' she added, with a note of personal approval.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But he was always very gracious about it,' said Nanny Ogg. 'And he—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The kingdom is worried,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, I already said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't mean the people, I meant the kingdom.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny explained. Nanny interrupted a few times with brief questions. It didn't occur to her to doubt anything she heard. Granny Weatherwax never made things up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At the end of it she said, 'Well.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My feelings exactly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fancy that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Quite so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And what did the animals do then?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Went away. <em class="calibre10">It</em> had brought them there, it let them go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No one et anyone else?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not where I saw.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Funny thing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right enough.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg stared at the setting sun.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't reckon a lot of kingdoms do that sort of thing,' she said. 'You saw the theatre. Kings and such are killing one another the whole time. Their kingdoms just make the best of it. How come this one takes offence all of a sudden?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's been here a long time,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So's everywhere,' said Nanny, and added, with the air of a lifetime student, 'Everywhere's been where it is ever since it was first put there. It's called geography.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's just about land,' said Granny. 'It's not the same as a kingdom. A kingdom is made up of-all sorts of things. Ideas. Loyalties. Memories, It all sort of exists together. And then all these things create some kind of life. Not a body kind of life, more like a living idea. Made up of everything that's alive and what they're thinking. And what the people <em class="calibre10">before</em> them thought.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat reappeared and began to lay the fire with the air of one in a trance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can see you've been thinking about this a lot,' said Nanny, speaking very slowly and carefully. 'And this kingdom wants a better king, is that it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No! That is, yes. Look—' she leaned forward – 'it doesn't have the same kind of likes and dislikes as people, right?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg leaned back. 'Well, it wouldn't, would it,' she ventured.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It doesn't care if people are good or bad. I don't think it could even <em class="calibre10">tell,</em> any more than you could tell if an ant was a good ant. But it expects the king to care for it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but,' said Nanny wretchedly. She was becoming a bit afraid of the gleam in Granny's eye. 'Lots of people have killed each other to become king of Lancre. They've done all kinds of murder.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't matter! Don't matter!' said Granny, waving her arms. She started counting on her fingers. 'For why,' she said. 'One, kings go round killing each other because it's all part of destiny and such and doesn't count as murder, and two, they killed for the kingdom. That's the important bit. But this new man just wants the power. He hates the kingdom.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a bit like a dog, really,' said Magrat. Granny looked at her with her mouth open to frame some suitable retort, and then her face softened.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very much like,' she said. 'A dog doesn't care if its master's good or bad, just so long as it likes the dog.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, then,' said Nanny. 'No-one and nothing likes Felmet. What are we going to do about it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nothing. You know we can't meddle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You saved that baby,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's not meddling!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Have it your way,' said Nanny. 'But maybe one day he'll come back. Destiny again. And you said we should hide the crown. It'll all come back, mark my words. Hurry up with that tea, Magrat.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you going to do about the burghers?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I told them they'll have to sort it out themselves. Once we use magic, I said, it'd never stop. You know that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' said Granny, but there was a hint of wistfulness in her voice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll tell you this, though,' said Nanny. 'They didn't like it much. They was muttering when they left.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat blurted out, 'You know the Fool, who lives up at the castle?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Little man with runny eyes?' said Nanny, relieved that the conversation had returned to more normal matters.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not that little,' said Magrat. 'What's his name, do you happen to know?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's just called Fool,' said Granny. 'No job for a man, that. Running around with bells on.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'His mother was a Beldame, from over Blackglass way,' said Nanny Ogg, whose knowledge of the genealogy of Lancre was legendary. 'Bit of a beauty when she was younger. Broke many a heart, she did. Bit of a scandal there, I did hear. Granny's right, though. At the end of the day, a Fool's a Fool.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why d'you want to know, Magrat?' said Granny Weather-wax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh ... one of the girls in the village was asking me,' said Magrat, crimson to the ears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny cleared her throat, and grinned at Granny Weatherwax, who sniffed aloofly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a steady job,' said Nanny. 'I'll grant you that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Huh,' said Granny. 'A man who tinkles all day. No kind of husband for anyone, I'd say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You – she'd always know where he was,' said Nanny, who was enjoying this. 'You'd just have to listen.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Never trust a man with horns on his hat,' said Granny flatly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat stood up and pulled herself together, giving the impression that some bits had to come quite a long way.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're a pair of silly old women,' she said quietly. 'And I'm going home.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She marched off down the path to her village without another word.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The old witches stared at one another.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well!' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's all these books they read today,' said Granny. 'It overheats the brain. You haven't been putting ideas in her head, have you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What do you mean?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You <em class="calibre10">know</em> what I mean.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny stood up. 'I certainly don't see why a girl should have to be single her whole life just because you think it's the right thing,' she said. 'Anyway, if people didn't have children, where would we be?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'None of your girls is a witch,' said Granny, also standing up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They <em class="calibre10">could</em> have been,' said Nanny defensively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, if you'd let them work it out for themselves, instead of encouragin' them to throw themselves at men.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They're good-lookin'. You can't stand in the way of human nature. You'd know that if you'd ever—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If I'd ever what?' said Granny Weatherwax, quietly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They stared at one another in shocked silence. They could both feel it, the tension creeping into their bodies from the ground itself, the hot, aching feeling that they'd started something they must finish, no matter what.</span>

        <span>'I knew you when you were a gel,' said Nanny sullenly. 'Stuck-up, you were.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'At least I spent most of the time upright,' said Granny. 'Disgustin', that was. Everyone thought so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How would you know?' snapped Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You were the talk of the whole village,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you were, too! They called you the Ice Maiden. Never knew that, did you?' sneered Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wouldn't sully my lips by sayin' what they called you,' shouted Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh yes?' shrieked Nanny. 'Well, let me tell you, my good woman—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't you dare talk to me in that tone of voice! I'm not anyone's good woman—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Right!'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another silence while they stared at one another, nose to nose, but this silence was a whole quantum level of animosity higher than the last one; you could have roasted a turkey in the heat of this silence. There was no more shouting. Things had got far too bad for shouting. Now the voices came in low and full of menace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I should have known better than to listen to Magrat,' growled Granny. 'This coven business is ridiculous. It attracts entirely the wrong sort of people.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm very glad we had this little talk,' hissed Nanny Ogg. 'Cleared the air.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked down.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Thunder rolled in the distance. The permanent Lancre storm, after a trip through the foothills, had drifted back towards the mountains for a one-night stand. The last rays of sunset shone livid through the clouds, and fat drops of water began to thud on the witches' pointed hats.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I really don't have time for all this,' snapped Granny, trembling. 'I have far more important things to do.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And me,' said Nanny.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">

        <span>They turned their backs on one another and strode away into the downpour.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The midnight rain drummed on Magrat's curtained windows as she thumbed her way purposefully through Goodie Whemper's books of what, for want of any better word, could be called natural magic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The old woman had been a great collector of such things and, most unusually, had written them down; witches didn't normally have much use for literacy. But book after book was filled with tiny, meticulous handwriting detailing the results of patient experiments in applied magic. Goodie Whemper had, in fact, been a research witch<a href="#note_10" title="Someone has to do it. It's all very well calling for eye of newt, but do you mean Common, Spotted or Great Crested? Which eye, anyway? Will tapioca do just as well? If we substitute egg white will the spell a) work b) fail or c) melt the bottom out of the cauldron? Goodie Whemper's curiosity about such things was huge and insatiable*."><sup class="calibre11">[10]</sup></a>. </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was looking up love spells. Every time she shut her eyes she saw a red-and-yellow figure on the darkness inside. Something had to be done about it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She shut the book with a snap and looked at her notes. First, she had to find out his name. The old peel-the-apple trick should do that. You just peeled an apple, getting one length of peel, and threw the peel behind you; it'd land in the shape of his name. Millions of girls had tried it and had inevitably been disappointed, unless the loved one was called Scscs. That was because they hadn't used an unripe Sunset Wonder picked three minutes before noon on the first frosty day in the autumn and peeled left-handedly using a silver knife with a blade less than half an inch wide; Goodie had done a lot of experimenting and was quite explicit on the subject. Magrat always kept a few by for emergencies, and this probably was one.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She took a deep breath, and threw the peel over her shoulder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned slowly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I'm a witch, she told herself. This is just another spell. There's nothing to be frightened of. Get a grip of yourself, girl. <em class="calibre10">Woman.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked down, and bit the back of her hand out of nervousness and embarrassment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who'd have thought it?' she said aloud.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had worked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned back to her notes, her heart fluttering. What was next? Ah, yes – gathering fern seed in a silk handkerchief at dawn. Goodie Whemper's tiny handwriting went on for two pages of detailed botanical instructions which, if carefully followed, resulted in the kind of love potion that had to be kept in a tightly-stoppered jar at the bottom of a bucket of iced water.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat pulled open her back door. The thunder had passed, but now the first grey light of the new day was drowned in a steady drizzle. But it still qualified as dawn, and Magrat was determined.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Brambles tugging at her dress, her hair plastered against her head by the rain, she set out into the dripping forest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The trees shook, even without a breeze.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg was also out early. She hadn't been able to get any sleep anyway, and besides, she was worried about Greebo. Greebo was one of her few blind spots. While intellectually she would concede that he was indeed a fat, cunning, evil-smelling multiple rapist, she nevertheless instinctively pictured him as the small fluffy kitten he had been decades before. The fact that he had once chased a female wolf up a tree and seriously surprised a she-bear who had been innocently digging for roots didn't stop her worrying that something bad might happen to him. It was generally considered by everyone else in the kingdom that the only thing that might slow Greebo down was a direct meteorite strike. Now she was using a bit of elementary magic to follow his trail, although anyone with a sense of smell could have managed it. It had led her through the damp streets and to the open gates of the castle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She gave the guards a nod as she went through. It didn't occur to either of them to stop her because witches, like beekeepers and big gorillas, went where they liked. In any case, an elderly lady banging a bowl with a spoon was probably not the spearhead of an invasion force.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Life as a castle guard in Lancre was extremely boring. One of them, leaning on his spear as Nanny went past, wished there could be some excitement in his job. He will shortly learn the error of his ways. The other guard pulled himself together, and saluted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mornin', Mum.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mornin', our Shawn,' said Nanny, and set off across the inner courtyard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Like all witches Nanny Ogg had an aversion to front doors. She went around the back and entered the keep via the kitchens. A couple of maids curtsied to her. So did the head housekeeper, whom Nanny Ogg vaguely recognised as a daughter-in-law, although she couldn't remember her name.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And so it was that when Lord Felmet came out of his bedroom he saw, coming along the passage towards him, a witch. There was no doubt about it. From the tip of her pointed hat to her boots, she was a witch. And she was coming for him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat slid helplessly down a bank. She was soaked to the skin and covered in mud. Somehow, she thought bitterly, when you read these spells you always think of it being a fine sunny morning in late spring. And she had forgotten to check what bloody kind of bloody fern it bloody was.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A tree tipped a load of raindrops on to her. Magrat pushed her sodden hair out of her eyes and sat down heavily on a fallen log, from which grew great clusters of pale and embarrassing fungus.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had seemed such a lovely idea. She'd had great hopes of the coven. She was sure it wasn't right to be a witch alone, you could get funny ideas. She'd dreamed of wise discussions of natural energies while a huge moon hung in the sky, and then possibly they'd try a few of the old dances described in some of Goodie Whemper's books. Not actually <em class="calibre10">naked,</em> or sky clad as it was rather delightfully called, because Magrat had no illusions about the shape of her own body and the older witches seemed solid across the hems, and anyway that wasn't absolutely necessary. The books said that the old-time witches had sometimes danced in their shifts. Magrat had wondered about how you danced in shifts. Perhaps there wasn't room for them all to dance at once, she'd thought.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>What she hadn't expected was a couple of crochety old women who were barely civil at the best of times and simply didn't enter into the spirit of things. Oh, they'd been kind to the baby, in their own way, but she couldn't help feeling that if a witch was kind to someone it was entirely for deeply selfish reasons.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And when they did magic, they made it look as ordinary as housekeeping. They didn't wear any occult jewellery. Magrat was a great believer in occult jewellery.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was all going wrong. And she was going home.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stood up, wrapped her damp dress around her, and set off through the misty woods ...</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">... and heard the running feet. <span>Someone was coming through them at high speed, without caring who heard him. and over the top of the sound of breaking twigs was a curious dull jingling. Magrat sidled behind a dripping holly bush and peered cautiously through the leaves.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was Shawn, the youngest of Nanny Ogg's sons, and the metal noise was caused by his suit of chain mail, which was several sizes too big for him. Lancre is a poor kingdom, and over the centuries the chain mail of the palace guards has had to be handed down from one generation to another, often on the end of a long stick. This one made him look like a bulletproof bloodhound.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stepped out in front of him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is that you, Mss Magrat?' said Shawn, raising the flap of mail that covered his eyes. 'It's mam!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's happened to her?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

          <span>'He's</span>

        <span> locked her up! Said she was coming to poison him! And I can't get down to the dungeons to see because there's all new guards! They say she's been put in chains—' Shawn frowned – 'and that means something horrible's going to happen. You know what she's like when she loses her temper. We'll never hear the last of it, miz.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where were you going?' demanded Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>To fetch our Jason and our Wane and our Darron and our—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wait a moment.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, Mss Magrat, suppose they try to torture her? You know what a tongue she's got on her when she gets angry—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm thinking,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's put his own bodyguards on the gates and everything—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look, just shut up a minute, will you, Shawn?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When our Jason finds out, he's going to give the duke a real seeing-to, miz. He says it's about time someone did.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg's Jason was a young man with the build and, Magrat had always thought, the brains of a herd of oxen. Thick-skinned though he was, she doubted whether he could survive a hail of arrows.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't tell him yet,' she said thoughtfully. 'There could be another way . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll go and find Granny Weatherwax, shall I, miz?' said Shawn, hopping from one leg to another. <em class="calibre10">'She'll</em> know what to do, she's a witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat stood absolutely still. She had thought she was angry before, but now she was furious. She was wet and cold and hungry and this <em class="calibre10">person</em> – once upon a time, she heard herself thinking, she would have burst into tears at this point.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oops,' said Shawn. 'Um. I didn't mean. </span>Whoops. Um . . .' He backed away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you happen to see Granny Weatherwax,' said Magrat slowly, in tones that should have etched her words into glass, 'you can tell her that I will sort it all out. Now go away before I turn you into a frog. You look like one anyway.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned, hitched up her skirts, and ran like hell towards her cottage.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lord Felmet was one of nature's gloaters. He was good at it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Quite comfortable, are we?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg considered this. 'Apart from these stocks, you mean?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am impervious to your foul blandishments,' said the duke. 'I scorn your devious wiles. You are to be tortured, I'll have you know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This didn't appear to have the required effect. Nanny was staring around the dungeon with the vaguely interested gaze of a sightseer.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And then you will be burned,' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Okay,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

          <span>'Okay?'</span>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, it's bloody freezing down here. What's that big wardrobe thing with the spikes?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke was trembling. 'Aha,' he said. 'Now you realise, eh? That, my dear lady, is an Iron Maiden. It's the latest thing. Well may you—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can I have a go in it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your pleas fall on deaf . . . </span>' The duke's voice trailed off. <span>His twitch started up.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess leaned forward until her big red face was inches away from Nanny's nose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This insouciance gives you pleasure,' she hissed, 'but soon you will laugh on the other side of your face!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's only got this side,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess fingered a tray of implements lovingly. 'We shall see,' she said, picking up a pair of pliers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you need not think any others of your people will come to your aid,' said the duke, who was sweating despite the chill. 'We alone hold the keys to this dungeon. Ha ha. You will be an example to all those who have been spreading malicious rumours about me. Do not protest your innocence! I hear the voices all the time, lying . . . </span>'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess gripped him ferociously by the arm. 'Enough,' she rasped. 'Come, Leonal. We will let her reflect on her fate for a while.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'. . .the faces . . . wicked lies . . . I wasn't there, and anyway he fell . . . my porridge, all salty . . .' murmured the duke, swaying.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The door slammed behind them. There was a click of locks and a thudding of bolts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny was left alone in the gloom. A flickering torch high on the wall only made the surrounding darkness more forbidding. Strange metal shapes, designed for no more exalted purpose than the destruct-testing of the human body, cast unpleasant shadows. Nanny Ogg stirred in her chains.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' she said. 'I can see you. Who are you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>King Verence stepped forward.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I saw you making faces behind him,' said Nanny Ogg. 'All I could do to keep a straight face myself.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wasn't making faces, woman, I was scowling.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny squinted. 'Ere, I know you,' she said. 'You're dead.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I prefer the term "passed over",' said the king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'd bow<a href="#note_11" title="Witches never curtsey."><sup class="calibre11">[11]</sup></a>,' <span>said Nanny. 'Only there's all these chains and things. You haven't seen a cat around here, have you?'</span></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. He's in the room upstairs, asleep.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny appeared to relax. 'That's all right, then,' she said. 'I was beginning to worry.' She stared around the dungeon again. 'What's that big bed thing over there?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The rack,' said the king, and explained its use. Nanny Ogg nodded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What a busy little mind he's got,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I fear, madam, that I may be responsible for your present predicament,' said Verence, sitting down on or at least just above a handy anvil. 'I wished to attract a witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose you're no good at locks?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I fear they would be beyond my capabilities as yet . . . but surely—' the ghost of the king waved a hand in a vague gesture which encompassed the dungeon, Nanny and the manacles – 'to a witch all this is just so much—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Solid iron,' said Nanny. 'You might be able to walk through it, but I can't.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't realise,' said Verence. 'I thought witches could do magic.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Young man,' said Nanny, 'you will oblige me by shutting up.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Madam! I am a king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You are also dead, so I wouldn't aspire to hold any opinions if I was you. Now just be quiet and wait, like a good boy.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Against all his instincts, the king found himself obeying. There was no gainsaying that tone of voice. It spoke to him across the years, from his days in the nursery. Its echoes told him that if he didn't eat it all up he would be sent straight to bed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg stirred in her chains. She hoped they would turn up soon.</span>

        <span>'Thank you,' said Granny Weatherwax, and because Shawn seemed to be expecting it, added, 'You've been a good boy.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes'm,' said Shawn. 'M'm?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Was there something else?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Shawn twisted the end of his chain-mail vest out of embarrassment. 'It's not true what everyone's been saying about our mam, is it, m'm?' he said. 'She doesn't go round putting evil curses on folk. Except for Daviss the butcher. And old Cakebread, after he kicked her cat. But they wasn't what you'd call real curses, was they, m'm?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can stop calling me m'm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, m'm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They've been saying that, have they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, m'm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, your mam does upset people sometimes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Shawn hopped from one leg to another.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, m'm, but they says terrible things about you, m'm, savin' your presence, m'm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stiffened.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What things?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't like to say, m'm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'What things?'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Shawn considered his next move. There weren't many choices.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A lot of things what aren't true, m'm,' he said, establishing his credentials as early as possible. 'All sorts of things. Like, old Verence was a bad king and you helped him on the throne, and you caused that bad winter the other year, and old Norbut's cow dint give no milk after you looked at it. Lot of lies, m'm,' he added, loyally.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She shut the door in his panting face, stood in thought for a moment, and retired to her rocking chair.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Eventually she said, once more, 'Right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A little later she added, 'She's a daft old besom, but we can't have people going round doing things to witches. Once you've lost your respect, you ain't got a thing. I don't remember looking at old Norbut's cow. Who's old Norbut?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stood up, took her pointed hat from its hook behind the door and, glaring into the mirror, skewered it in place with a number of ferocious hatpins. They slid on one by one by one, as unstoppable as the wrath of God.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She vanished into the outhouse for a moment and came back with her witch's cloak, which served as a blanket for sick goats when not otherwise employed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Once upon a time it had been black velvet; now it was just black. It was carefully and slowly fastened by a tarnished silver brooch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No samurai, no questing knight, was ever dressed with as much ceremony.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Finally Granny drew herself up, surveyed her dark reflection in the glass, gave a thin little smile of approval, and left via the back door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The air of menace was only slightly dispelled by the sound of her running up and down outside, trying to get her broomstick started.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was also regarding herself in the mirror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She'd dug out a startlingly green dress that was designed to be both revealing and clinging, and would have been if Magrat had anything to display or cling to, so she'd shoved a couple of rolled-up stockings down the front in an effort to make good the more obvious deficiencies. She had also tried a spell on her hair, but it was naturally magic-resistant and already the natural shape was beginning to assert itself (a dandelion clock at about 2pm).</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat had also tried makeup. This wasn't an unqualified success. She didn't have much practice. She was beginning to wonder if she'd overdone the eyeshadow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Her neck, fingers and arms between them carried enough silverware to make a full-sized dinner service, and over everything she had thrown a black cloak lined with red silk.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In a certain light and from a carefully chosen angle, Magrat was not unattractive. Whether any of these preparations did anything for her is debatable, but they did mean that a thin veneer of confidence overlaid her trembling heart.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She drew herself up and turned this way and that. The clusters of amulets, magical jewellery and occult bangles on various parts of her body jingled together; any enemy wouldn't only have to be blind to fail to notice that a witch was approaching, he'd have to be deaf as well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned to her worktable and examined what she rather self-consciously, and never in Granny's hearing, called her Tools of the Craft. There was the white-handled knife, used in the preparation of magical ingredients. There was the black-handled knife, used in the magical workings themselves; Magrat had carved so many runes into its handle it was in constant danger of falling in half. They were undoubtedly powerful, but . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat shook her head regretfully, went over to the kitchen dresser and took out the breadknife. Something told her that at times like these a good sharp breadknife was probably the best friend a girl could have.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I spy, with my little eye,' said Nanny Ogg, 'something beginning with P.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The ghost of the king stared wearily around the dungeons.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pliers,' he suggested.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pilliwinks?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's a pretty name. What is it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a kind of thumbscrew. Look,' said the king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not that,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Choke-pear?' he said desperately.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's a C, and anyway I don't know what it is,' said Nanny Ogg. The king obligingly indicated it on the tray, and explained its use.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Definitely not,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Smouldering Boot of Punishment?' said the king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're a bit too good at these names,' said Nanny sharply. 'You sure you didn't use them when you were alive?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Absolutely, Nanny,' said the ghost.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Boys that tell lies go to a bad place,' warned Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lady Felmet had most of them installed herself, it's the truth,' said the king desperately; he felt his position to be precarious enough without having any bad places to worry about.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny sniffed. 'Right, then,' she said, slightly mollified. 'It was "pinchers".'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But pinchers is just another name for pi—' the king began, and stopped himself in time. During his adult life he'd been afraid of no man, beast or combination of the two, but Nanny's voice brought back old memories of schoolroom and nursery, of life under strict orders given by stern ladies in long skirts, and nursery food – mostly grey and brown -which seemed indigestible at the time but now appeared a distant ambrosia.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's five to me,' said Nanny happily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They'll be back soon,' said the king. 'Are you sure you'll be all right?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If I'm not, precisely how much help can you be?' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was the sound of bolts sliding back.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was already a crowd outside the castle as Granny's broomstick wobbled uncertainly towards the ground. They went quiet as she strode forward, and parted to let her pass. She had a basket of apples under her arm.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's a witch in the dungeons,' someone whispered to Granny. 'And foul tortures, they say!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nonsense,' said Granny. 'It couldn't be. I expect Nanny Ogg has just gone to advise the king, or something.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They say Jason Ogg's gone to fetch his brothers,' said a stallholder, in awe.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I really advise you all to return home,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'There has probably been a misunderstanding. Everyone knows a witch cannot be held against her will.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's gone too far this time,' said a peasant. 'All this burning and taxing and now this. I blame you witches. It's got to stop. I know my rights.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What rights are they?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Dunnage, cowhage-in-ordinary, badinage, leftovers, scrommidge, clary and spunt,' said the peasant promptly. 'And acornage, every other year, and the right to keep two-thirds of a goat on the common. Until he set fire to it. It was a bloody good goat, too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A man could go far, knowing his rights like you do,' said Granny. 'But right now he should go home.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned and looked at the gates. There were two extremely apprehensive guards on duty. She walked up to them, and fixed one of them with a look.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am a harmless old seller of apples,' she said, in a voice more appropriate for the opening of hostilities in a middle-range war. </span>'Pray let me past, dearie.' The last word had knives in it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No-one must enter the castle,' said one of the guards. 'Orders of the duke.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny shrugged. The apple-seller gambit had never worked more than once in the entire history of witchcraft, as far as she knew, but it was traditional.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know you, Champett Poldy,' she said. 'I recall I laid out your grandad and I brought you into the world.' She glanced at the crowds, which had regathered a little way off, and turned back to the guard, whose face was already a mask of terror. She leaned a little closer, and said, 'I gave you your first good hiding in this valley of tears and by all the gods if you cross me now I will give you your last.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a soft metallic noise as the spear fell out of the man's fearful fingers. Granny reached and gave the trembling man a reassuring pat on the shoulder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But don't worry about it,' she added. 'Have an apple.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She made to step forward, and a second spear barred her way. She looked up with interest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other guard was not a Ramtopper, but a city-bred mercenary brought up to swell the ranks depleted in recent years. His face was a patchwork of scar tissue. Several of the scars rearranged themselves into what was possibly a sneer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So that's witches' magic, is it?' said the guard. 'Pretty poor stuff. Maybe it frightens these country idiots, woman, but it doesn't frighten me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I imagine it takes a lot to frighten a big strong lad like you,' said Granny, reaching up to her hat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And don't you try to put the wind up me, neither.' The guard stared straight ahead, and rocked gently on the balb of his feet. 'Old ladies like you, twisting people around. It shouldn't be stood for, like they say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just as you like,' said Granny, pushing the spear aside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Listen, I <em class="calibre10">said—'</em> the guard began, and grabbed Granny's shoulder. Her hand moved so quickly it hardly seemed to move at all, but suddenly he was clutching at his arm and moaning.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny replaced the hatpin in her hat and ran for it.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We will begin,' said the duchess, leering, 'with the Showing of the Implements.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Seen 'em,', said Nanny. 'Leastways, all the ones beginning with P, S, I, T and W.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Then let us see how long you can keep that light conversational tone. Light the brazier, Felmet,' snapped the duchess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Light the brazier, Fool,' said the duke.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool moved slowly. He hadn't expected any of this. Torturing people hadn't been on his mental agenda. Hurting old ladies in cold blood wasn't his cup of tea, and actually hurting witches in blood of any temperature whatsoever failed to be an entire twelve-course banquet. Words, he'd said. All this probably came under the heading of sticks and stones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I don't like doing this,' he murmured under his breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Fine,' said Nanny Ogg, whose hearing was superb. 'I'll remember that you didn't like it.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What's that?' said the duke sharply.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Nothing,' said Nanny. 'Is this going to take long? I haven't had breakfast.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool lit a match. There was the faintest disturbance in the air beside him, and it went out. He swore, and tried another. This time his shaking hands managed to get it as far as the brazier before it, too, flared and darkened.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Hurry up, man!' said the duchess, laying out a tray of tools.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Doesn't seem to want to light—' muttered the Fool, as another match became a fluttering streak of flame and then went out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duke snatched the box from his trembling fingers and caught him across the cheek with a handful of rings.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Can no orders of mine be obeyed?' he screamed. 'Infirm of purpose! Weak! Give me the box!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool backed away. Someone he couldn't see was whispering things he couldn't quite make out in his ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Go outside,' hissed the duke, 'and see that we are not disturbed!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool tripped over the bottom step, turned and, with a last imploring look at Nanny, scampered through the door He capered a little bit, out of force of habit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'The fire isn't completely necessary,' said the Duchess. 'It merely assists. Now, woman, will you confess?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What to?' said Nanny.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It's common knowledge. Treason. Malicious witchcraft. Harbouring the king's enemies. Theft of the crown—'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A tinkling noise made them look down. A blood-stained dagger had fallen off the bench, as though someone had tried to pick it up but just couldn't get the strength together. Nanm heard the king's ghost swear under'its breath, or what would have been its breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'—and spreading false rumours,' finished the duchess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'—salt in my food—' said the duke, nervously, staring at the bandages on his hand. He kept getting the feeling that there was a fourth person in the dungeon.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'If you <em class="calibre10">do</em> confess,' said the duchess, 'you will merely be burned at the stake. And, please, no humorous remarks.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What false rumours?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duke closed his eyes, but the visions were still there 'Concerning the accidental death of the late King Verence.' he whispered hoarsely. The air swirled again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny sat with her head cocked to one side, as though listening to a voice only she could hear. Except that the duke was certain that he could hear something too, not exactly a voice, something like the distant sighing of the wind.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Oh, I don't know nothing false,' she said. 'I know you stabbed him, and <em class="calibre10">you</em> gave him the dagger. It was at the top of the stairs.' She paused, head cocked, nodded, and added, 'Just by the suit of armour with the pike, and <em class="calibre10">you</em> said, "If it's to be done, it's better if it's done quickly", or something, and then you snatched the king's own dagger, the very same what is now lying on the floor, out of his belt and—'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You lie! There were no witnesses. We made . . . there was nothing to witness! I heard someone in the dark, but there was no-one there! There couldn't have been anyone seeing anything!' screamed the duke. His wife scowled at him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Do shut up, Leonal,' she said. 'I think within these four walls we can dispense with that sort of thing.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Who told her? Did you tell her?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And calm down. No-one told her. She's a witch, for goodness sake, they find out about these things. Second glance, or something.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Sight,' said Nanny.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Which you will not possess much longer, my good woman, unless you tell us who else knows and indeed, assist us on a number of other matters,' said the duchess grimly. 'And you will do so, believe me. I am skilled in these things.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Granny glanced around the dungeon. It was beginning to get crowded. King Verence was bursting with such angry vitality that he was very nearly apparent, and was furiously trying to get a grip on a knife. But there were others behind – wavering, broken shapes, not exactly ghosts but memories, implanted in the very substances of the walls themselves by sheer pain and terror.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'My own dagger! The bastards! They killed me with my own dagger,' said the ghost of King Verence silently, raising his transparent arms and imploring the netherworld in general to witness this ultimate humiliation. 'Give me strength...'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes,' said Nanny. 'It's worth a try.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now we will commence,' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said the guard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I SAID,' said Magrat, 'I've come to sell my lovely apples. Don't you listen?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's not a sale on, is there?' The guard was extremely nervous since his colleague had been taken off to the infirmary. He hadn't taken the job in order to deal with this sort of thing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It dawned on him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're not a witch, are you?' he said, fumbling awkwardly with his pike.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course not. Do I look like one?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The guard looked at her occult bangles, her lined cloak, her trembling hands and her face. The face was particulary worrying. Magrat had used a lot of powder to make her face pale and interesting. It combined with the lavishly applied mascara to give the guard the impression that he was looking at two flies that had crashed into a sugar bowl. He found his fingers wanted to make a sign to ward off the evil eyeshadow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' he said uncertainly. His mind was grinding through the problem. She was a witch. Just lately there'd been a lot of gossip about witches being bad for your health. He'd been told not to let witches pass, but no-one had said anything about apple sellers. Apple sellers were not a problem. It was witches that were the problem. She'd said she was an apple seller and he wasn't about to doubt a witch's word.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Feeling happy with this application of logic, he stood to one side and gave an expansive wave.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pass, apple seller,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Thank you,' said Magrat sweetly. 'Would you like an apple?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, thanks. I haven't finished the one the other witch gave me.' His eyes rolled. 'Not a witch. Not a witch, an apple seller An apple seller. She ought to know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How long ago was this?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just a few minutes . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax was not lost. She wasn't the kind of person who ever became lost. It was just that, at the moment, while she knew exactly where SHE was, she didn't know the position of anywhere else. Currently she had arrived in the kitchens again, precipitating a breakdown in the cook, who was trying to roast some celery. The fact that several people had tried to buy apples from her wasn't improving her temper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat found her way to the Great Hall, empty and deserted at this time of day except for a couple of guards who were playing dice. They wore the tabards of Felmet's own personal bodyguard, and stopped their game as soon as she appeared.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, well,' said one, leering. 'Come to keep us company have you, my pretty<a href="#note_12" title="No-one knows why men say things like this. Any minute now he is probably going to say he likes a girl with spirit."><sup class="calibre11">[12]</sup></a>.</span>
        <span>'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was looking for the dungeons,' said Magrat, to whom the words 'sexual harassment' were a mere collection of syllables.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just fancy,' said one of the guards, winking at the other. 'I reckon we can help you there.' They got up and stood either side of her; she was aware of two chins you could strike matches on and an overpowering smell of stale beer. Frantic signals from outlying portions of her mind began to break down her iron-hard conviction that bad things only happened to bad people.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They escorted her down several flights of steps into a maze of dank, arched passageways as she sought hurriedly for some polite way of disengaging herself.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I should warn you,' she said, 'I am not, as I may appear, a simple apple seller.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fancy that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am, in fact, a witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This did not make the impression she had hoped. The guards exchanged glances.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fair enough,' said one. 'I've always wondered what it was like to kiss a witch. Around here they do say you gets turned into a frog.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other guard nudged him. 'I reckon, then,' he said, in the slow, ripe tones of one who thinks that what he is about to say next is going to be incredibly funny, 'you kissed one years ago.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The brief guffaw was suddenly interrupted when Magrat was flung against the wall and treated to a close up view of the guard's nostrils.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Now listen to me, sweetheart,' he said. 'You ain't the first witch we've had down here, if witch you be, but you could be lucky and walk out again. If you are nice to us, d'you see?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a shrill, short scream from somewhere nearby.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That, you see,' said the guard, 'was a witch having it the hard way. You could do us all a favour, see? Lucky you met us, really.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His questing hand stopped its wandering. 'What's this?' he said to Magrat's pale face. 'A knife? A knife? I reckon we've got to take that very seriously, don't you, Hron?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You got to tie her hands and gag her,' said Hron hurriedly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They can't do no magic if they can't speak or wave their hands about . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can take your hands off her!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>All three stared down the passage at the Fool. He was jingling with rage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let her go this minute!' he shouted. 'Or I'll report you!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, you'll report us, will you?' said Hron. 'And will anyone listen to you, you earwax-coloured little twerp?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is a witch we have here,' said the other guard. 'So you can go and tinkle somewhere else.' He turned back to Magrat. 'I like a girl with spirit,' he said, incorrectly as it turned out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool advanced with the bravery of the terminally angry.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I told you to let her go,' he repeated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hron drew his sword and winked at his companion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat struck. It was an unplanned, instinctive blow, its stopping power considerably enhanced by the weight of rings and bangles; her arm whirred around in an arc that connected with her captor's jaw and spun him twice before he folded up in a heap with a quiet little sigh, and incidentally with several symbols of occult significance embossed on his cheek.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hron gaped at him, and then looked at Magrat. He raised his sword at about the same moment that the Fool cannoned into him, and the two men went down in a struggling heap Like most small men the Fool relied on the initial mad rush to secure an advantage and was at a loss for a follow-through and it would probably have gone hard with him if Hron hadn't suddenly become aware that a breadknife was pressed to his neck.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let go of him,' said Magrat, pushing her hair out of her eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stiffened. 'You're wondering whether I really would cut your throat,' panted Magrat. 'I don't know either. Think of the fun we could have together, finding out.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She reached down with her other hand and hauled the Few to his feet by his collar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where did that scream come from?' she said, without taking her eyes off the guard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was down this way. They've got her in the torture dungeon and I don't like it, it's going too far, and I couldn't get in and I came to look for someone—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, you've found me,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You,' she said to Hron, 'will stay here. Or run away, for all I care. But you won't follow us.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He nodded, and stared after them as they hurried down the passage. 'The door's locked,' said the Fool. 'There's all sorts of noises, but the door's locked.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, it's a dungeon, isn't it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They're not supposed to lock from the inside!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was, indeed, unbudgeable. Silence came from the other side – a busy, thick silence that crawled through the cracks and spilled out into the passage, a kind of silence that is worse than screams.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool hopped from one foot to the other as Magrat explored the door's rough surface.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you really a witch?' he said. 'They said you were a witch, are you really? You don't look like a witch, you look very . . . that is . . .'He blushed. 'Not like a, you know, crone at all, but absolutely beautiful . . .' </span>His voice trailed into silence . . .</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I am totally in control of the situation, Magrat told herself. I never thought I would be, but I am thinking absolutely clearly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And she realised, in an absolutely clear way, that her padding had slipped down to her waist, her head felt as though a family of unhygienic birds had been nesting in it, and her eyeshadow had not so much run as sprinted. Her dress was torn in several places, her legs were scratched, her arms were bruised, and for some reason she felt on top of the world.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think you'd better stand back, Verence,' she said. 'I'm not sure how this is going to work.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a sharp intake of breath.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How did you know my name?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sized up the door. The oak was old, centuries old, but she could sense just a little sap under a surface varnished by the years into something that was nearly as tough as stone. Normally what she had in mind would require a day's planning and a bagful of exotic ingredients. At least, so she'd always believed. Now she was prepared to doubt it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>If you could conjure demons out of washtubs, you could do anything.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She became aware that the Fool had spoken.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, I expect I heard it somewhere,' she said vaguely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I shouldn't think so, I never use it,' said the Fool. 'I mean, it's not a popular name with the duke. It was me mam, you see. They like to name you after kings, I suppose. My grandad said I had no business having a name like that and he said I shouldn't go around—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat nodded. She was looking around the dank tunnel with a professional's eye.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It wasn't a promising place. The old oak planks had been down here in the darkness all these years, away from the clock of the seasons . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the other hand . . . Granny had said that somehow all trees were one tree, or something like that. <span>Magrat thought she understood it, although she didn't know exactly what it meant. And it was springtime up there. The ghost of life that still lived in the wood must know that. Or if it had forgotten, it must be told.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She put her palms flat on the door again and shut her eyes, tried to think her way out through the stone, out of the castle, and into the thin, black soil of the mountains, into the air, into the sunlight . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool was merely aware that Magrat was standing very still. Then her hair stood out from her head, gently, and there was a smell of leafmould.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then, without warning, the hammer that can drive a marshmallow-soft toadstool through six inches of solid pavement or an eel across a thousand miles of hostile ocean to a particular pond in an upland field, struck up through her and into the door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stepped back carefully, her mind stunned, fighting against a desperate urge to bury her toes into the rock and put forth leaves. The Fool caught her, and the shock nearly knocked him over.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sagged against the faintly jingling body, and felt triumphant. She had done it! And with no artificial aids! If only the others could have seen this . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't go near it,' she mumbled. 'I think I gave it rather . . . a lot.' The Fool was still holding her toastrack body in his arms and was too overcome to utter a word, but she still got a reply.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I reckon you did,' said Granny Weatherwax, stepping out of the shadows. 'I never would have thought of it myself.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat peered at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've been here all the time?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Just a few minutes.' Granny glanced at the door. <span>'Good technique,' she said, 'but it's old wood. Been in a fire, too, I reckon. Lot of iron nails and stuff in there. Can't see it working, I'd have tried the stones if it was me, but—'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She was interrupted by a soft 'pop'.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another, and then a whole series of them together, like a shower of meringues.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Behind her, very gently, the door was breaking into leaf.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stared at it for a few seconds, and then met Magrat's terrified gaze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Run!' she yelled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They grabbed the Fool and scurried into the shelter of a convenient buttress.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The door gave a warning creak. Several of its planks twisted in vegetable agony and there was a shower of rock splinters when nails were expelled like thorns from a wound, ricocheting off the stonework. The Fool ducked as part of the lock whirred over his head and smashed into the opposite wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The lower parts of the planks extended questing white roots, which slithered across the damp stone to the nearest crack and began to auger in. Knotholes bulged, burst and thrust out branches which hit the stones of the doorway and tumbled them aside. And all the time there was a low groan, the sound of the cells of the wood trying to contain the surge of raw life pounding through them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If it had been <em class="calibre10">me,'</em> said Granny Weatherwax, as part of the ceiling caved in further along the passage, 'I wouldn't have done it like that. Not that I'm objecting, mind you,' she said, as Magrat opened her mouth. 'It's a reasonable job. I think you might have overdone it a bit, that's all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Excuse me,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can't do rocks,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, no, rocks is an acquired taste—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Excuse me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two witches stared at him, and he backed away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Weren't you supposed to be rescuing someone?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh,' said Granny. 'Yes. Come on, Magrat. We'd better see what she's been getting up to.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There were screams,' said the Fool, who couldn't help feeling they weren't taking things seriously enough.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I daresay,' said Granny, pushing him aside and stepping over a writhing taproot. 'If anyone locked <em class="calibre10">me</em> in a dungeon, there'd be screams.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a lot of dust inside the dungeon, and by the nimbus of light around its one torch Magrat could dimly make out two figures cowering in the furthest corner. Most of the furniture had been overturned and scattered across the floor; it didn't look as though any of it had been designed to be the last word in comfort. Nanny Ogg was sitting quite calmly in what appeared to be a sort of stocks.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Took your time,' she observed. 'Let me out of this, will you? I'm getting cramp.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And there was the dagger.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It spun gently in the middle of the room, glinting when the turning blade caught the light.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My own dagger!' said the ghost of the king, in a voice only the witches could hear. 'All this time and I never knew it! My own dagger! They bloody well did me in with my own bloody knife!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He took another step towards the royal couple, waving the dagger. A faint gurgle escaped from the lips of the duke, glad to be out of there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's doing well, isn't he,' said Nanny, as Magrat helped her out of her prison.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Isn't that the old king? Can they see him?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shouldn't think so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>King Verence staggered slightly under the weight. He was too old for such poltergeist activity; you had to be an adolescent for this . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let me just get a grip on this thing,' he said. 'Oh, damn . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The knife dropped from the ghost's tenuous grasp and clattered to the floor. Granny Weatherwax stepped forward smartly and put her foot on it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The dead shouldn't kill the living,' she said. 'It could be a dangerous wossname, precedent. We'd all be outnumbered for one thing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess surfaced from her terror first. There had been knives swooping through the air and exploding doors, and now these women were defying her in her own dungeons. She couldn't be sure how she was supposed to react to the supernatural items, but she had very firm ideas about how she should tackle the last one.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Her mouth opened like the gateway to a red hell. 'Guards!' she yelled, and spotted the Fool hovering near the door. 'Fool! Fetch the guards!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They're busy. We were just leaving,' said Granny. 'Which one of you is the duke?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Felmet stared pink-eyed up at her from his half-crouch in the corner. A thin dribble of saliva escaped from the corner of his mouth, and he giggled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked closer. In the centre of those streaming eyes something else looked back at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm going to give you no cause,' she said quietly. 'But it would be better for you if you left this country. Abdicate, or whatever.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'In favour of whom?' said the duchess icily. 'A witch?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I won't,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What did you say?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke pulled himself upright, brushed some of the dust off his clothes, and looked Granny full in the face. The coldness in the centre of his eyes was larger.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said I won't,' he said. 'Do you think a bit of simple conjuring would frighten me? I am the king by right of conquest, and you cannot change it. It is as simple as that, witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He moved closer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stared at him. She hadn't faced anything like this before. The man was clearly mad, but at the heart of his madness was a dreadful cold sanity, a core of pure interstellar ice in the centre of the furnace. She'd thought him weak under a thin shell of strength, but it went a lot further than that. Somewhere deep inside his mind, somewhere beyond the event horizon of rationality, the sheer pressure of insanity had hammered his madness into something harder than diamond.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you defeat me by magic, magic will rule,' said the duke. 'And you can't do it. And any king raised with your help would be under your power. Hag-ridden, I might say. That which magic rules, magic destroys. It would destroy you, too. You know it. Ha. Ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's knuckles whitened as he moved closer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You could strike me down,' he said. 'And perhaps you could find someone to replace me. But he would have to be a fool indeed, because he would know he was under your evil eye, and if he mispleased you, why, his life would be instantly forfeit. You could protest all you wished, but he'd know he ruled with your permission. And that would make him no king at all. Is this not true?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked away. The other witches hung back, ready to duck.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">said,</em> is this not true?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Granny. 'It is true . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'. . . but there is one who could defeat you,' said Granny slowly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The child? Let him come when he is grown. A young man with a sword, seeking his destiny.' The duke sneered. 'Very romantic. But I have many years to prepare. Let him try.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Beside him King Verence's fist smashed through the air and quite failed to connect.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke leaned closer until his nose was an inch from Granny's face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Get back to your cauldrons, wyrd sisters,' he said softly.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax stalked through the passages of Lancre Castle like a large, angry bat, the duke's laughter echoing around her head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You could give him boils or something,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Haemorrhoids are good. That's allowed. It won't stop him ruling, it just means he'll have to rule standing up. Always good for a laugh, that. Or piles.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax said nothing. If fury were heat, her hat would have caught fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mind you, that'd probably make him worse,' said Nanny, running to keep up. </span>'Same with toothache.' She gave a sideways glance at Granny's twitching features.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You needn't fret,' she said. They didn't do anything much. But thanks, anyway.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I ain't worried about you, Gytha Ogg,' snapped Granny. 'I only come along 'cos Magrat was fretting. What I say is, if a witch can't look after herself, she's got no business calling herself a witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Magrat done well with the woodwork, I thought.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even in the grip of her sullen fury, Granny Weatherwax spared a nod.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's coming along,' she said. She looked up and down the corridor, and then leaned closer to Nanny Ogg's ear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I ain't going to give him the pleasure of saying it,' she said, 'but he's got us beaten.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I don't know,' said Nanny. 'Our Jason and a few sharp lads could soon—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You saw some of his guards. These aren't the old sort. These are a tough kind.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We could give the boys just a bit of help—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It wouldn't work. People have to sort this sort of thing out for themselves.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you say so, Esme,' said Nanny meekly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I do. Magic's there to be ruled, not for ruling.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny nodded and then, remembering a promise, reached down and picked up a fragment of stone from the rubble on the tunnel floor.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought you'd forgotten,' said the ghost of the king, by her ear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Further down the passage the Fool was capering after Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can I see you again?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Well . . . I don't know,' said Magrat, her heart singing a smug song.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How about tonight?' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, no,' said Magrat. </span>'I'm very busy tonight.' She had intended to curl up with a hot milk drink and Goodie Whemper's notebooks on experimental astrology, but instinct told her that any suitor should have an uphill struggle put in front of him, just to make him keener.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tomorrow night, then?' the Fool persisted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think I should be washing my hair.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I could get Friday night free.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We do a lot of work at night, you see—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The afternoon, then.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat hesitated. Perhaps instinct had got it wrong. 'Well—' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'About two o'clock. In the meadow by the pond, all right?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'See you there, then. All right?' said the Fool desperately.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fool!' The duchess's voice echoed along the passage, and a look of terror crossed his face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I've got to go,' he said. 'The meadow, okay? I'll wear something so you recognise me. All right?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' echoed Magrat, hypnotised by the sheer pressure of his persistence. She turned and ran after the other witches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was pandemonium outside the castle. The crowd that had been there at Granny's arrival had grown considerably, and had flowed in through the now unguarded gateway and lapped around the keep. Civil disobedience was new to Lancre, but its inhabitants had already mastered some of its more elementary manifestations, viz, the jerking of rakes and sickles in the air with simple up-and-down motions accompanied by grimaces and cries of 'Gerrh!', although a few citizens, who hadn't quite grasped the idea, were waving flags and cheering. Advanced students were already eyeing the more combustible buildings inside the walls. Several sellers of hot meat pies and sausages in a bun had appeared from nowhere<a href="#note_13" title="They always do, everywhere. No-one sees them arrive. The logical explanation is that the franchise includes the stall, the paper hat and a small gas-powered time machine."><sup class="calibre11">[13]</sup></a></span>
        <span> and were doing a brisk trade. Pretty soon someone was going to throw something.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The three witches stood at the top of the steps that led to the keep's main door and surveyed the seas of faces.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's our Jason,' said Nanny happily. 'And Wane and Darron and Kev and Trev and Nev—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I will remember their faces,' said Lord Felmet, emerging between them and putting a hand on their shoulders. 'And do you see my archers, on the wails?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I see 'em,' said Granny grimly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then smile and wave,' said the duke. 'So that the people may know that all is well. After all, have you not been to see me today on matters of state?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He leaned closer to Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, there are a hundred things you could do,' he said. 'But the ending would always be the same.' He drew back. 'I'm not an unreasonable man, I hope,' he added, in cheerful tones. 'Perhaps, if you persuade the people to be calm, I may be prevailed upon to moderate my rule somewhat. I make no promises, of course.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny said nothing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Smile and wave,' commanded the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny raised one hand in a vague motion and produced a brief rictus that had nothing whatsoever to do with humour. Then she scowled and nudged Nanny Ogg, who was waving and mugging like a maniac.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No need to get carried away,' she hissed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But there's our Reel and our Sharleen and their babbies,' said Nanny. 'Coo-eee!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Will you shut up, you daft old besom!' snapped Granny. 'And pull yourself together!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Jolly good, well done,' said the duke. He raised his hands, or at least his hand. The other still ached. He'd tried the grater again last night, but it hadn't worked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'People of Lancre,' he cried, 'do not be afeared! I am your friend. I will protect you from the witches! They have agreed to leave you in peace!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stared at him as he spoke. He's one of these here maniac depressives, she said. Up and down like a woss-name. Kill you one minute and ask you how you're feeling the next.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She became aware that he was looking at her expectantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, I'll now call upon the respected Granny Weatherwax to say a few words, ha ha,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You said that, did you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've gone a long way too far,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I have, haven't I!' The duke giggled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned to the expectant crowds, which went silent.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Go home,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a further long silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is that all?' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What about pledges of eternal allegiance?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What about them? Gytha, will you stop waving at people!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now we are going to go, too,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we were getting on so well,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come, Gytha,' said Granny icily. 'And where's Magrat got to?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked up guiltily. She had been deep in conversation with the Fool, although it was the kind of conversation where both parties spend a lot of time looking at their feet and picking at their fingernails. Ninety per cent of true love is acute, ear-burning embarrassment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're leaving,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Friday afternoon, remember,' hissed the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, if I can,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg leered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And so Granny Weatherwax swept down the steps and through the crowds, with the other two running behind her. Several of the grinning guards caught her eye and wished they hadn't, but here and there, among the watching crowd, was a barely suppressed snigger. She hurtled through the gateway, across the drawbridge and through the town. Granny walking fast could beat most other people at a run.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Behind them the duke, who had crested the latest maniac peak on the switchback of his madness and was coasting speedily towards the watersplash of despair, laughed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ha ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny didn't stop until she was outside the town and under the welcoming eaves of the forest. She turned off the road and flumped down on a log, her face in her hands.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two approached her carefully. Magrat patted her on the back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't despair,' she said. 'You handled it very well, we thought.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I ain't despairing, I'm thinking,' said Granny. 'Go away.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg raised her eyebrows at Magrat in a warning fashion. They backed off to a suitable distance although, with Granny in her present mood, the next universe might not be far enough, and sat down on a moss-grown stone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you all right?' said Magrat. 'They didn't do anything, did they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Never laid a finger on me,' said Nanny. She sniffed. 'They're not your real royalty,' she added. 'Old King Gruneweld, for one, he wouldn't have wasted time waving things around and menacing people. It'd been bang, needles right under the fingernails from the word go, and no messing. None of this evil laughter stuff. He was a <em class="calibre10">real</em> king. Very gracious.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He was threatening to burn you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, I wouldn't of stood for it. I see you've got a follower,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The young fellow with the bells,' said Nanny. 'And the face like a spaniel what's just been kicked.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Oh, him.' Magrat blushed hotly under her pale makeup. <span>'Really, he's just this man. He just follows me around.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can be difficult, can that,' said Nanny sagely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Besides, he's so small. And he <em class="calibre10">capers</em> all over the place,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Looked at him carefully, have you?' said the old witch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pardon?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You haven't, have you? I thought not. He's a very clever man, that Fool. He ought to have been one of them actor men.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What do you mean?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Next time you have a look at him like a witch, not like a woman,' said Nanny, and gave Magrat a conspiratorial nudge. 'Good bit of work with the door back there,' she added. 'Coming on well, you are. I hope you told him about Greebo.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He said he'd let him out directly, Nanny.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a snort from Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you hear the sniggering in the crowd?' she said. 'Someone sniggered!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg sat down beside her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And a couple of them pointed,' she said. 'I know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not to be borne!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat sat down on the other end of the log.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's other witches,' she said. 'There's lots of witches further up the Ramtops. Maybe they can help.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two looked at her in pained surprise.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't think we need go <em class="calibre10">that</em> far,' sniffed Granny. <em class="calibre10">'Asking</em> for <em class="calibre10">help.</em>'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very bad practice,' nodded Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you asked a demon to help you,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, we didn't,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right. We didn't.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ordered it to assist.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'S'right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax stretched out her legs and looked at her boots. They were good strong boots, with hobnails and crescent-shaped scads; you couldn't believe a cobbler had made them, someone had laid down a sole and <em class="calibre10">built</em> up from there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean, there's that witch over Skund way,' she said. 'Sister Whosis, wossname, her son went off to be a sailor – you know, Gytha, her who sniffs and puts them antimassacres on the backs of chairs soon as you sits down—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Grodley,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Sticks her little finger out when she drinks her tea and drops her Haitches all the time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. Hwell. I haven't hlowered myself to talk to her hever since that business with the gibbet, you recall. I daresay she'd just love to come snooping haround here, running her fingers over heverything and sniffing, telling us how to do things. Oh. yes. <em class="calibre10">Help.</em> We'd all be in a fine to-do if we went around helping all the time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, and over Skund way the trees talk to you and walk around of night,' said Nanny. 'Without even asking permission. Very poor organisation.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not really good organisation, like we've got here?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stood up purposefully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm going home,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There are thousands of good reasons why magic doesn't rule the world. They're called witches and wizards. Magrat reflected, as she followed the other two back to the road.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was probably some wonderful organisation on the part of Nature to protect itself. It saw to it that everyone with any magical talent was about as ready to co-operate as a she-bear with toothache, so all that dangerous power was safely dissipated as random bickering and rivalry. There were differences in style, of course. Wizards assassinated each other in draughty corridors, witches just cut one another dead in the street. And they were all as self-centred as a spinning top. Even when they help other people, she thought, they're secretly doing it for themselves. Honestly, they're just like big children.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Except for me, she thought smugly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's very upset, isn't she,' said Magrat to Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah, well,' said Nanny. 'There's the problem, see. The more you get used to magic, the more you don't want to use it. The more it gets in your way. I expect, when you were just starting out, you learned a few spells from Goodie Whemper, maysherestinpeace, and you used them all the time, didn't you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, yes. Everyone does.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well-known fact,' agreed Nanny. 'But when you get along in the Craft, you learn that the hardest magic is the sort you don't use at all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat considered the proposition cautiously. 'This isn't some kind of Zen, is it?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Dunno. Never seen one.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When we were in the dungeons, Granny said something about trying the rocks. That sounded like pretty hard magic.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, Goodie wasn't much into rocks,' said Nanny. 'It's not really hard. You just prod their memories. You know, of the old days. When they were hot and runny.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She hesitated, and her hand flew to her pocket. She gripped the lump of castle stone and relaxed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Thought I'd forgotten it, for a minute there,' she said, lifting it out. 'You can come out now.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was barely visible in the brightness of day, a mere shimmer in the air under the trees. King Verence blinked. He wasn't used to daylight.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Esme,' said Nanny. 'There's someone to see you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned slowly and squinted at the ghost.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I saw you in the dungeon, didn't I?' she said. 'Who're you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Verence, King of Lancre,' said the ghost, and bowed. 'Do I have the honour of addressing Granny Weatherwax, doyenne of witches?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It has already been pointed out that just because Verence came from a long line of kings didn't mean that he was basically stupid, and a year without the distractions of the flesh had done wonders as well. Granny Weatherwax considered herself totally unsusceptible to buttering up, but the king was expertly applying the equivalent of the dairy surplus of quite a large country. Bowing was a particularly good touch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A muscle twitched at the corner of Granny's mouth. She gave a stiff little bow in return, because she wasn't quite sure what 'doyenne' meant.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm her,' she conceded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can get up now,' she added, regally.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>King Verence remained kneeling, about two inches above the actual ground.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I crave a boon,' he said urgently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here, how did you get out of the castle?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The esteemed Nanny Ogg assisted me,' said the king. 'I reasoned, if I am anchored to the stones of Lancre, then I can also go where the stones go. I am afraid I indulged in a little trickery to arrange matters. Currently I am haunting her apron.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not the first, either,' said Granny, automatically.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Esme!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And I beg you, Granny Weatherwax, to restore my son to the throne.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Restore?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You know what I mean. He is in good health?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded. 'The last time we Looked at him, he was eating an apple,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It is his destiny to be King of Lancre!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, well. Destiny is tricky, you know,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You will not help?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked wretched. 'It's meddling, you see,' she said. 'It always goes wrong if you meddle in politics. Like, once you start, you can't stop. Fundamental rule of magic, is that. You can't go around messing with fundamental rules.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're not going to help?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well ... naturally, one day, when your lad is a bit older ...'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where is he now?' said the king, coldly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches avoided one another's faces.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We saw him safe out of the country, you see,' said Granny awkwardly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very good family,' Nanny Ogg put in quickly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What kind of people?' said the king. 'Not commoners, I trust?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Absolutely not,' said Granny with considerable firmness as a vision of Vitoller floated across her imagination. 'Not common at all. Very uncommon. Er.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Her eyes implored Magrat for help.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They were Thespians,' said Magrat firmly, her voice radiating such approval that the king found himself nodding automatically.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh,' he said. 'Good.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Were they?' whispered Nanny Ogg. 'They didn't look it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't show your ignorance, Gytha Ogg,' sniffed Granny. She turned back to the ghost of the king. 'Sorry about that, your majesty. It's just her showing off. She don't even know where Thespia <em class="calibre10">is</em>.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wherever it is, I hope that they know how to school a man in the arts of war,' said Verence. 'I know Felmet. In ten years he'll be dug in here like a toad in a stone.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The king looked from witch to witch. 'What kind of kingdom will he have to come back to? I hear what the kingdom is becoming, even now. Will you watch it change, over the years, become shoddy and mean?' The king's ghost faded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His voice hung in the air, faint as a breeze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Remember, good sisters,' he said, 'the land and the king are one.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And he vanished.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The embarrassed silence was broken by Magrat blowing her nose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'One what?' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We've got to do something,' said Magrat, her voice choked with emotion. 'Rules or no rules!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's very vexing,' said Granny, quietly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but what are you going to do?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Reflect on things,' said Granny. 'Think about it all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've been thinking about it for a year,' Magrat said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'One what? Are one what?' said Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's no good just reacting,' said Granny. 'You've got to—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A cart came bouncing and rumbling along the track from Lancre. Granny ignored it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—give these things careful consideration.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You don't know what to do, do you?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nonsense. I—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's a cart coming, Granny.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax shrugged. 'What you youngsters don't realise—' she began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Witches never bothered with elementary road safety. Such traffic as there was on the roads of Lancre either went around them or, if this was not possible, waited until they moved out of the way. Granny Weatherwax had grown up knowing this for a fact; the only reason she didn't die knowing that it wasn't was that Magrat, with rather better reflexes, dragged her into the ditch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was an interesting ditch. There were jiggling corkscrew things in it which were direct descendants of things which had been in the primordial soup of creation. Anyone who thought that ditchwater was dull could have spent an instructive half-hour in that ditch with a powerful microscope. It also had nettles in it, and now it had Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She struggled up through the weeds, incoherent with rage, and rose from the ditch like Venus Anadyomene, only older and with more duckweed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'T-t-t,' she said, pointing a shaking finger at the disappearing cart.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was young Nesheley from over Inkcap way,' said Nanny Ogg, from a nearby bush. 'His family were always a bit wild. Of course, his mother was a Whipple.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He ran us down!' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You could have got out of the way,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Get out of the way?'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said Granny. 'We're witches! People get out of <em class="calibre10">our</em> way!' She squelched on to the track, her finger still pointing at the distant cart. 'By Hoki, I'll make him wish he'd never been born—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He was quite a big baby, I recall,' said the bush. 'His mother had a terrible time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's never happened to me before, ever,' said Granny, still twanging like a bowstring. 'I'll teach him to run us down as though, as though, as though we was ordinary people!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He already knows,' said Magrat. 'Just help me get Nanny out of this bush, will you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll turn his-'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'People haven't got any respect any more, that's what it is,' said Nanny, as Magrat helped her with the thorns. 'It's all due to the king being one, I expect.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're witches!' screamed Granny, turning her face towards the sky and shaking her fists.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes,' said Magrat. 'The harmonious balance of the universe and everything. I think Nanny's a bit tired.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What've I been doing all this time?' said Granny, with a rhetorical flourish that would have made even Vitoller gasp.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not a lot,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Laughed at! Laughed at! On my own roads! In my own country!' screamed Granny. 'That just about does it! I'm not taking ten more years of this! I'm not taking another <em class="calibre10">day</em> of it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The trees around her began to sway and the dust from the road sprang up into, writhing shapes that tried to swirl out of her way. Granny Weatherwax extended one long arm and at the end of it unfolded one long finger and from the rip of its curving nail there was a brief flare of octarine fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Half a mile down the track all four wheels fell off the cart at once.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lock up a witch, would he?' Granny shouted at the trees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny struggled to her feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We'd better grab her,' she whispered to Magrat. The two of them leapt at Granny and forced her arms down to her sides.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll bloody well show him what a witch could do!' she yelled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes, very good, very <em class="calibre10">good,'</em> said Nanny. 'Only perhaps not just now and not just like this, eh?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wyrd sisters, indeed!' Granny yelled. 'I'll make his—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hold her a minute, Magrat,' said Nanny Ogg, and rolled up her sleeve.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It can be like this with the highly-trained ones,' she said, and brought her palm round in a slap that lifted both witches off their feet. On such a flat, final note the universe ought have ended.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At the conclusion of the breathless silence which followed Granny Weatherwax said, 'Thank you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She adjusted her dress with some show of dignity, and added, 'But I meant it. We'll meet tonight at the stone and do what must be done. Ahem.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She reset the pins in her hat and set off unsteadily in the direction of her cottage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whatever happened to the rule about not meddling in politics?' said Magrat, watching her retreating back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg massaged some life back into her fingers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'By Hoki, that woman's got a jaw like an anvil,' she said 'What was that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, what about this rule about not meddling?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said Nanny. She took the girl's arm. 'The thing is,' she explained, 'as you progress in the Craft, you'll learn there is another rule. Esme's obeyed it all her life.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And what's that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When you break rules, break 'em good and hard,' said Nanny, and grinned a set of gums that were more menacing than teeth. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke smiled out over the forest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It works,' he said. 'The people mutter against the witches. How do you do it, Fool?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Jokes, nuncle. And gossip. People are halfway ready to believe it anyway. Everyone respects the witches. The point is that no-one actually likes them very much.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Friday afternoon, he thought. I'll have to get some flowers. And my best suit, the one with the silver bells. Oh gosh.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is very pleasing. If it goes on like this, Fool, you shall have a knighthood.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This was no.302, and the Fool knew better than to let a feed line go hungry. 'Marry, nuncle,' he said wearily, ignoring the spasm of pain that crawled across the duke's face, 'if n I had a Knighthood (Night Hood), why, it would keep my ears Warm in Bedde; i'faith, if many a Knight is a Fool, why, should a—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, yes, all right,' snapped Lord Felmet. </span>In fact he was feeling much better already. His porridge hadn't been oversalted this evening, and there was a decently empty feel about the castle. There were no more voices on the cusp of hearing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He sat down on the throne. It felt really comfortable for the first time . . .</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duchess sat beside him, her chin on her hand, watching the Fool intently. This bothered him. He thought he knew where he stood with the duke, it was just a matter of hanging on until his madness curved back to the cheerful stage, but the duchess genuinely frightened him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It seems that words are extremely powerful,' she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Indeed, lady.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You must have made a lengthy study.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool nodded. The power of words had sustained him through the hell of the Guild. Wizards and witches used words as if they were tools to get things done, but the Fool reckoned that words were things in their own right.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Words can change the world,' he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her eyes narrowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'So you have said before. I remain unconvinced. Strong men change the world,' she said. 'Strong men and their deeds. Words are just like marzipan on a cake. Of course you think words are important. You are weak, you have nothing else.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Your ladyship is wrong.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duchess's fat hand drummed impatiently on the arm of her throne.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You had better,' she said, 'be able to substantiate that comment.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Lady, the duke wishes to chop down the forests, is this not so?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'The trees talk about me,' whispered Lord Felmet. 'I hear them whisper when I go riding. They tell lies about me!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duchess and the Fool exchanged glances.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'But,' the Fool continued, 'this policy has met with fanatical opposition.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'People don't like it.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duchess exploded. 'What does that matter?' she roared. 'We rule! They will do what we say or they will be pitilessly executed!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool bobbed and capered and waved his hands in a conciliatory fashion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'But, my love, we will run out of people,' murmured the duke.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No need, no need!' said the Fool desperately. 'You don't have to do that at all! What you do is, you—' he paused for a moment, his lips moving quickly – 'you embark upon a far-reaching and ambitious plan to expand the agricultural industry, provide long-term employment in the sawmills, open new land for development, and reduce the scope for banditry.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This time the duke looked baffled. 'How will I do that?' he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Chop down the forests.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'But you said—'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Shut up, Felmet,' said the duchess. She subjected the Fool to another long, thoughtful stare.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Exactly how,' she said, eventually, 'does one go about knocking over the houses of people one does not like?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Urban clearance,' said the Fool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I was thinking of burning them down.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">'Hygienic</em> urban clearance,' the Fool added promptly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And sowing the ground with salt.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Marry, I suspect that is hygienic urban clearance and a programme of environmental improvements. It might be a good idea to plant a few trees as well.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No more trees!' shouted Felmet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Oh, it's all right. They won't survive. The important thing is to have planted them.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'But I also want us to raise taxes,' said the duchess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Why, nuncle—'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And I am not your nuncle.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'N'aunt?' said the Fool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Why . . . prithee . . . you need to finance your ambitious programme for the country.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Sorry?' said the duke, who was getting lost again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'He means that chopping down trees costs money,' said the duchess. She smiled at the Fool. It was the first time he had ever seen her look at him as if he was other than a disgusting little cockroach. There was still a large element of cockroach in her glance, but it said: good little cockroach, you have learned a trick.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Intriguing,' she said. 'But can your words change the past?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool considered this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'More easily, I think,' he said. 'Because the past is what people remember, and memories are words. Who knows how a king behaved a thousand years ago? There is only recollection, and stories. And plays, of course.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Ah, yes. I saw a play once,' said Felmet. 'Bunch of funny fellows in tights. A lot of shouting. The people liked it.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You tell me history is what people are told?' said the duchess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fool looked around the throne room and found King Gruneberry the Good (906-967).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">'Was</em> he?' he said, pointing. 'Who knows, now? What was he good <em class="calibre10">at?</em> But he will be Gruneberry the Good until the end of the world.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duke was leaning forward in his throne, his eyes gleaming.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I want to be a <em class="calibre10">good</em> ruler,' he said. 'I want people to like me. I would like people to remember me fondly.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Let us assume,' said the duchess, 'that there were other matters, subject to controversy. Matters of historical record that had . . . been clouded.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I didn't do it, you know,' said the duke, quickly. 'He slipped and fell. That was it. Slipped and fell. I wasn't even there. He attacked me. It was self-defence. That's it. He slipped and fell on his own dagger in self-defence.' His voice fell to a mumble. 'I have no recollection of it at this time,' he murmured. He rubbed his dagger hand, although the word was becoming inappropriate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Be quiet, husband,' snapped the duchess. 'I know you didn't do it. I wasn't there with you, you may recall. It was I who didn't hand you the dagger.' The duke shuddered again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And now, Fool,' said Lady Felmet. 'I was saying, I believe, that perhaps there are matters that should be <em class="calibre10">properly recorded.</em>'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Marry, that you were not there at the time?' said the Fool, brightly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It is true that words have power, and one of the things they are able to do is get out of someone's mouth before the speaker has the chance to stop them. If words were sweet little lambs, then the Fool watched them bound cheerfully away into the flamethrower of the duchess's glare.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Not <em class="calibre10">where?'</em> she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Anywhere,' said the Fool hastily.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Stupid man! Everyone is somewhere.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I mean, you were everywhere but at the top of the stairs,' said the Fool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Which stairs?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Any stairs,' said the Fool, who was beginning to sweat. 'I distinctly remember not seeing you!'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The duchess eyed him for a while.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'So long as you remember it,' she said. The duchess rubbed her chin, which made an audible rasping noise.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Reality is only weak words, you say. Therefore, words are reality. But how can words become history?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It was a very good play, the play that I saw,' said Felmet dreamily. 'There were fights, and no-one really died. Some very good speeches, I thought.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was another sandpapery sound from the duchess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Fool?' she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Lady?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Can you write a play? A play that will go around the world, a play that will be remembered long after rumour has died?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No, lady. It is a special talent.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'But can you find someone who has it?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'There are such people, lady.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Find one,' murmured the duke. 'Find the best. Find the best. The truth will out. Find one.'</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The storm was resting. It didn't want to be, but it was. It had spent a fortnight understudying a famous anticyclone over the Circle Sea, turning up every day, hanging around in the cold front, grateful for a chance to uproot the occasional tree or whirl a farmhouse to any available emerald city of its choice. But the big break in the weather had never come.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It consoled itself with the thought that even the really great storms of the past – the Great Gale of 1789, for example, or Hurricane Zelda and Her Amazing Raining Frogs – had gone through this sort of thing at some stage in their career. It was just part of the great tradition of the weather.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Besides, it had had a good stretch in the equivalent of pantomime down on the plains, bringing seasonal snow and terminal frostbite to millions. It just had to be philosophical about being back up here now with nothing much to do except wave the heather about. If weather was people, this storm would be filling in time wearing a cardboard hat in a hamburger hell.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Currently it was observing three figures moving slowly over the moor, converging with some determination on a bare patch where the standing stone stood, or usually stood, though just at the moment it wasn't visible.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It recognised them as old friends and connoisseurs, and conjured up a brief unseasonal roll of thunder as a form of greeting. This was totally ignored.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'The bloody stone's gone,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'However many there is of it.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her face was pale. It might also have been drawn; if so, then it was by a very neurotic artist. She looked as though she meant business. Bad business.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Light the fire, Magrat,' she added automatically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I daresay we'll all feel better for a cup of tea,' said Nanny Ogg, mouthing the words like a mantra. She fumbled in the recesses of her shawl. 'With something in it,' she added, producing a small bottle of applejack.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Alcohol is a deceiver and tarnishes the soul,' said Magrat virtuously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I never touch the stuff,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'We should keep a clear head, Gytha.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Just a drop in your tea isn't drinking,' said Nanny. 'It's medicine. It's a chilly old wind up here, sisters.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Very well,' said Granny. 'But just a drop.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They drank in silence. Eventually Granny said, 'Well, Magrat. You know all about the coven business. We might as well do it right. What do we do next?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Magrat hesitated. She wasn't up to suggesting dancing naked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'There's a song,' she said. 'In praise of the full moon.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It ain't full,' Granny pointed out. 'It's wossname. Bulging.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Gibbous,' said Nanny obligingly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I think it's in praise of full moons in general,' Magrat hazarded. 'And then we have to raise our consciousness. It really ought to be full moon for that, I'm afraid. Moons are very important.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Granny gave her a long, calculating look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'That's modern witchcraft for you, is it?' she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It's part of it, Granny. There's a lot more.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax sighed. 'Each to her own, I suppose. I'm blowed if I'll let a ball of shiny rock tell <em class="calibre10">me</em> what to do.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, bugger all that,' said Nanny. 'Let's curse somebody.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool crept cautiously along the nighttime corridors. He wasn't taking any chances either. Magrat had given him a graphic account of Greebo's general disposition, and the Fool had borrowed a couple of gloves and a sort of metal wimple from the castle's store of hereditary chain mail.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He reached the lumber room, lifted the latch cautiously, pushed the door and then flung himself against the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The corridor became slightly darker as the more intense darkness inside the room spilled out and mingled with the rather lighter darkness already there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Apart from that, nothing. The number of spitting, enraged balls of murderous fur pouring through the door was zero. The Fool relaxed, and slipped inside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo dropped on his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had been a long day. The room did not offer the kind of full life that Greebo had come to expect and demand. The only point of interest had been the discovery, around mid-morning, of a colony of mice who had spent generations eating their way through a priceless tapestry history of Lancre and had just got as far as King Murune (709-745), who met a terrible fate<a href="#note_14" title="Involving a red hot poker, a privy, ten pounds of live eels, a three mile stretch of frozen river, a butt of wine, a couple of tulip bulbs, a number of poisoned eardrops, an oyster and a large man with a mallet. King Murune didn't make friends easily."><sup class="calibre11">[14]</sup></a></span>
        <span>, when they did, too. He had sharpened his claws on a bust of Lancre's only royal vampire, Queen Grimnir the Impaler (1514-1553, 1553-1557, 1557-1562, 1562-1567 and 1568-1573). He had performed his morning ablutions on a portrait of an unknown monarch, which was beginning to dissolve. Now he was bored, and also angry.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He raked his claws across the place where the Fool's ears should have been, and was rewarded with nothing more than a metallic scraping noise.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who's a good boy, den?' said the Fool. 'Wowsa wowsa whoosh.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This intrigued Greebo. The only other person who had ever spoken to him like this was Nanny Ogg; everyone else addressed him as 'Yarrgeroffoutofityahbarstard'. He leaned down very carefully, intrigued by the new experience.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>From the Fool's point of view an upside-down cat face lowered itself slowly into his field of vision, wearing an expression of evil-eyed interest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Does oo want to go home, den?' said the Fool hopefully. 'Look, Mr Door is <em class="calibre10">open.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo increased his grip. He had found a friend.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool shrugged, very carefully, turned, and walked back into the passage. He made his way down through the hall, out into the courtyard, around the side of the guardroom and out through the main gate, nodding – carefully – to the guards.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Man just went past with a cat on his head,' one of them remarked, after a minute or two's reflection.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'See who it was?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The Fool, I think.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a thoughtful pause. The second guard shifted his grip on his halberd.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a rotten job,' he said. 'But I suppose someone's got to do it.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ain't going to curse anyone,' said Granny firmly. 'It hardly ever works if they don't know you've done it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What you do is, you send him a doll of himself with pins in.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, Gytha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All you have to do is get hold of some of his toenails,' Nanny persisted, enthusiastically.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Or some of his hair or anything. I've got some pins.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'No.'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cursing people is morally unsound and extremely bad for your karma,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I'm going to curse him anyway,' said Nanny. 'Under my breath, like. I could of caught my death in that dungeon for all he cared.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ain't going to curse him,' said Granny. 'We're going to replace him. What did you do with the old king?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I left the rock on the kitchen table,' said Nanny. 'I couldn't stand it any more.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't see why,' said Magrat. 'He seemed very pleasant. For a ghost.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, <em class="calibre10">he</em> was all right. It was the others,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Others?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "Pray carry a stone out of the palace so's I can haunt it, good mother," he says,' said Nanny Ogg. ' "It's bloody boring in here, Mistress Ogg, excuse my Klatchian," he says, so of course I did. I reckon they was all listening. Ho yes, they all thinks, all aboard, time for a bit of a holiday. I've nothing against ghosts. Especially royal ghosts,' she added loyally. 'But my cottage isn't the place for them. I mean, there's some woman in a chariot yelling her head off in the washhouse. I ask you. And there's a couple of little kiddies in the pantry, and men without heads all over the place, and someone screaming under the sink, and there's this little hairy man wandering around looking lost and everything. It's not right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just so long as he's not here,' said Granny. 'We don't want any men around.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's a ghost, not a man,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We don't have to go into details,' Granny said icily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you can't put the old king back on the throne,' said Magrat. 'Ghosts can't rule. You'd never get the crown to stay on. It'd drop through.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're going to replace him with his son,' said Granny. 'Proper succession.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, we've been through all that,' said Nanny, dismissively. 'In about fifteen years' time, perhaps, but—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tonight,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A child on the throne? He wouldn't last five minutes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not a child,' said Granny quietly. 'A grown man. Remember Aliss Demurrage?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence. Then Nanny Ogg sat back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bloody hell,' she whispered. 'You ain't going to try that, are you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean to have a go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bloody hell,' said Nanny again, very quietly, and added. 'You've been thinking about this, have you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'See here, Esme. I mean, Black Aliss was one of the best. I mean, you're very good at, well, headology and thinking and that. I mean, Black Aliss, well, she just upped and went at it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You saying I couldn't do it, are you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Excuse me,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No. No. Of course not,' said Nanny, ignoring her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only . . . well, she was a, you know, a hoyden of witches, like the king said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Doyenne,' said Granny, who had looked it up. 'Not hoyden.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Excuse me,' said Magrat, louder this time. 'Who was Black Aliss? And,' she added quickly, 'none of this exchanging meaningful glances and talking over my head. There's three witches in this coven, remember?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She was before your time,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Before mine, really. She lived over Skunid way. Very powerful witch.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If you listen to rumour,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She turned a pumpkin into a royal coach once,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Showy,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'That's no help to anyone, turning up at a ball smelling like a pie. And that business with the glass slipper. Dangerous, to my mind.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But the biggest thing she ever did,' said Nanny, ignoring the interruption, 'was to send a whole palace to sleep for a hundred years until. . .' She hesitated. 'Can't remember. Was there rose bushes involved, or was it spinning wheels in that one? I think some princess had to finger . . . no, there was a prince. That was it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Finger a prince?' said Magrat, uneasily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No . . .he had to kiss her. Very romantic, Black Aliss was. There was always a bit of romance in her spells. She liked nothing better than Girl meets Frog.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why did they call her Black Aliss?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fingernails,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And teeth,' said Nanny Ogg. 'She had a sweet tooth. Lived in a real gingerbread cottage. Couple of kids shoved her in her own oven at the end. Shocking.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you're going to send the castle to sleep?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She never sent the castle to sleep,' said Granny. 'That's just an old wives' tale,' she added, glaring at Nanny. 'She just stirred up time a little. It's not as hard as people think. Everyone does it all the time. It's like rubber, is time. You can stretch it to suit yourself.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was about to say, that's not right, time is time, every second lasts a second, that's what it's for, that's its <em class="calibre10">job . . .</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then she recalled weeks that had flown past and afternoons that had lasted forever. Some minutes had lasted hours, some hours had gone past so quickly she hadn't been aware they'd gone past at all . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But that's just people's perception,' she said. 'Isn't it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes,' said Granny, 'of course it is. It all is. What difference does that make?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A hundred years'd be over-egging it, mind,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I reckon fifteen'd be a nice round number,' said Granny. 'That means the lad will be eighteen at the finish. </span>We just do the spell, go and fetch him, he can manifest his destiny, and everything will be nice and neat.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Magrat didn't comment on this, because it had occurred to her that destinies sounded easy enough when you talked about them but were never very bankable where real human beings were concerned. But Nanny Ogg sat back and tipped another generous measure of apple brandy in her tea.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Could work out nice,' she said. 'A bit of peace and quiet for fifteen years. If I recall the spell, after you say it you have to fly around the castle before cock crow.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I wasn't thinking about that,' said Granny. 'It wouldn't be right. Felmet would still be king all that time. The kingdom would still get sick. No, what I was thinking of doing was moving the whole kingdom.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She beamed at them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'The whole of Lancre?' said Nanny.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Fifteen years into the future?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny looked at Granny's broomstick. It was a well-made thing, built to last, apart from the occasional starting problem. But there were limits.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You'll never do it,' she said. 'Not around the whole kingdom in that. That's all the way up to Powderknife and down to Drumlin's Fell. You just couldn't carry enough magic.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I've thought of that,' said Granny.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She beamed again. It was terrifying.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She explained the plan. It was dreadful.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A minute later the moor was deserted, as the witches hurried to their tasks. It was silent for a while, apart from the squeak of bats and the occasional rustle of the wind in the heather.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then there was a bubbling from the nearby peat bog. Very slowly, crowned with a thicket of sphagnum moss, the standing stone surfaced and peered around the landscape with an air of deep distrust. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo was really enjoying this. At first he thought his new friend was taking him to Magrat's cottage, but for some reason he'd wandered off the path in the dark and was taking a stroll in the forest. In one of the more interesting bits, Greebo had always felt. It was a hummocky area, rich in hidden potholes and small, intense swamps, full of mist even in fine weather. Greebo often came up here on the offchance that a wolf was lying up for the day.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought cats could find their own way home,' the Fool muttered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He cursed himself under his breath. It would have been easy to take this wretched creature back to Nanny Ogg's house, which was only a few streets away, almost in the shadow of the castle. But then he'd had the idea of delivering it to Magrat. It would impress her, he thought. Witches were very keen on cats. And then she'd be bound to ask him in, for a cup of tea or something . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He put his foot in another water-filled hole. Something wriggled underneath it. The Fool groaned, and stepped back on to a tumescent mushroom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look, cat,' he said. 'You've got to come down, right? And then you can find your way home and I'll follow you. Cats are good at seeing in the dark and finding their own way home,' he added hopefully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He reached up. Greebo sank his claws into his arm as a friendly warning, and found to his surprise that this had no effect on chain mail.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's a good cat,' said the Fool, and lowered him to the ground. 'Go on, find your way home. Any home will do.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo's grin gradually faded, until there was nothing left but the cat. This was nearly as spooky as the opposite way round.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stretched and yawned to hide his embarrassment. Being called a good cat in the middle of one of his favourite stalking grounds wasn't going to do anything for his prowl-credibility. He disappeared into the undergrowth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool peered into the gloom. It dawned on him that while he liked forests, he liked them at one remove, as it were; it was nice to know that they were there, but the forests of the mind were not quite the same as real forests that, for example, you got lost in. They had more mighty oaks and fewer brambles. They also tended to be viewed in daylight, and the trees didn't have malevolent faces and long scratchy branches. The trees of the imagination were proud giants of the forest. Most of the trees here appeared to be vegetable gnomes, mere trellises for fungi and ivy.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool was vaguely aware that you could tell which direction the Hub lay by seeing which side of the trees the moss grew on. A quick inspection of the nearby trunks indicated that, in defiance of all normal geography, the Hub lay everywhere.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Greebo had vanished.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool sighed, removed his chain mail protection, and tinkled gently through the night in search of high ground. High ground seemed a good idea. The ground he was on at the moment appeared to be trembling. He was sure it shouldn't do that. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat hovered on her broomstick several hundred feet above the Turnwise borders of Lancre, looking down on a sea of mist through which the occasional treetop poked like a seaweed-covered rock at high tide. A bulging moon floated above her, probably gibbous again. Even a decent thin crescent would have been better, she felt. More appropriate.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She shivered, and wondered where Granny Weatherwax was at this moment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The old witch's broomstick was known and feared throughout the skies of Lancre. Granny had been introduced to flying quite late in life, and after some initial suspicion had taken to it like a bluebottle to an ancient fish-head. A problem, however, was that Granny saw every flight simply as a straight line from A to B and was unable to get alongside the idea that other users of the air might have any rights whatsoever; the flight migration patterns of an entire continent had been changed because of that simple fact. High-speed evolution among local birds had developed a generation that flew on their backs, so that they could keep a watchful eye on the skies.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's implicit belief that everything should get out of her way extended to other witches, very tall trees and, on occasion, mountains.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny had also browbeaten the dwarfs who lived under the mountains and in fear of their lives into speeding the thing up. Many an egg had been laid in mid-air by unsuspecting fowls who had suddenly glimpsed Granny bearing down on them, scowling over the top of the broomstick.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh dear,' thought Magrat. 'I hope she hasn't happened to someone.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A midnight breeze turned her gently around in the air, like an unsupported weathercock. She shivered and squinted at the moonlit mountains, the high Ramtops, whose freezing crags and ice-green chasms acknowledged no king or cartographer. Only on the Rim ward side was Lancre open to the world; the rest of its borders looked as jagged as a wolfs mouth and far more impassable. From up here it was possible to see the whole kingdom . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a ripping noise in the sky above her, a blast of wind that spun her around again, and a Doppler-distorted cry of, 'Stop dreaming, girl!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She gripped the bristles with her knees and urged the stick upward.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It took several minutes to catch up with Granny, who was lying almost full length along her broomstick to reduce wind resistance. Dark treetops roared far below them as Magrat came alongside. Granny turned to her, holding her hat on with one hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not before time,' she snapped. 'I don't reckon this one's got more'n a few minutes flight left. Come on, get a move on.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She reached out a hand. So did Magrat. Unsteadily, the broomsticks bucking and dipping in one another's slipstream, they touched fingertips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat's arm tingled as the power flowed up it<a href="#note_15" title="Possibly the first attempt at the in-flight refuelling of a broomstick."><sup class="calibre11">[15]</sup></a>. </span>
        <span>
          <span>Granny's broomstick jerked forward.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Leave me a bit,' shouted Magrat. 'I've got to get down!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shouldn't be difficult,' screamed Granny, above the noise of the wind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean get down safely!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're a witch, ain't you? By the way, did you bring the cocoa? I'm freezing up here!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat nodded desperately, and with her spare hand passed up a straw bag.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' said Granny. 'Well done. See you at Lancre Bridge.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She uncurled her fingers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat whirled away in the buffeting wind, clinging tightly to a broomstick which now, she feared, had about as much buoyancy as a bit of firewood. It certainly wasn't capable of sustaining a full-grown woman against the beckoning fingers of gravity.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>As she plunged down towards the forest roof in a long shallow dive she reflected that there was possibly something complimentary in the way Granny Weatherwax resolutely refused to consider other people's problems. It implied that, in her considerable opinion, they were quite capable of sorting them out by themselves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Some kind of Change spell was probably in order.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat concentrated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Well, that seemed to work.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nothing in the sight of mortal man had in fact changed. What Magrat had achieved was a mere adjustment of the mental processes, from a bewildered and slightly frightened woman gliding inexorably towards the inhospitable ground to a clearheaded, optimistic and positive thinking woman who had really got it together, was taking full responsibility for her own life and in general knew where she was coming from although, unfortunately, where she was <em class="calibre10">heading</em> had not changed in any way. But she felt a lot better about it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She dug her heels in and forced the broomstick to yield the last dregs of its power in a brief burst, sending it skimming erratically a few feet from the trees. As it sagged again and started to plough a furrow among the midnight leaves she tensed herself, prayed to whatever gods of the forest might be listening that she would land on something soft, and let go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There are three thousand known major gods on the Disc, and research theologians discover more every week. Apart from the minor gods of rock, tree and water, there are two that haunt the Ramtops – Hoki, half a man, half a goat, and entirely a bad practical joker, who was banished from Dunmanifestin for pulling the old exploding mistletoe joke on Blind Io, chief of all the gods; and also Herne the Hunted, the terrified and apprehensive deity of all small furry creatures whose destiny it is to end their lives as a brief, crunchy squeak . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Either could have been candidates for the small miracle which then occurred, for – in a forest full of cold rocks, jagged stumps and thorn bushes – Magrat landed on something soft.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny, meanwhile, was accelerating towards the mountains on the second leg of the journey. She consumed the regrettably tepid cocoa and, with proper environmental consideration, dropped the bottle as she passed over an upland lake.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It turned out that Magrat's idea of sustaining food was two rounds of egg and cress sandwiches with the crusts cut off and, Granny noticed before the wind whipped it away, a small piece of parsley placed with consideration and care on top of each one. Granny regarded them for some time. Then she ate them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A chasm loomed, still choked with winter snow. Like a tiny spark in the darkness, a dot of light against the hugeness of the Ramtops, Granny tackled the maze of the mountains.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Back in the forest, Magrat sat up and absent-mindedly pulled a twig from her hair. A few yards away the broomstick dropped through the trees, showering leaves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A groan and a small, half-hearted tinkle caused her to peer into the gloom. An indistinct figure was on its hands and knees, searching for something.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did I land on you?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Someone did,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They crawled nearer to one another.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you doing here?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, I was walking along the ground,' said the Fool. 'A lot of people do, you know. I mean, I know it's been done before. It's not original. It probably lacks imagination but, well, it's always been good enough for me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did I hurt you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think I've got one or two bells that won't be the same again.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool scrabbled through the leafmould, and finally located his hated hat. It clonked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Totally crushed, i'faith,' he said, putting it on anyway. He seemed to feel better for that, and went on, 'Rain, yes, hail, yes, even lumps of rock. Fish and small frogs, okay. Women no, up till now. Is it going to happen again?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've got a bloody hard head,' said Magrat, pulling herself to her feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Modesty forbids me to comment,' said the Fool, and then remembered himself and added, quickly, 'Prithee.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They stared at one another again, their minds racing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat thought: Nanny said look at him properly. I'm looking at him. He just looks the same. A sad thin little man in a ridiculous jester's outfit, he's practically a hunchback.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then, in the same way that a few random bulges in a cloud can suddenly become a galleon or a whale in the eye of the beholder, Magrat realised that the Fool was not a little man. He was at least of average height, but he <em class="calibre10">made</em> himself small, by hunching his shoulders, bandying his legs and walking in a half-crouch that made him appear as though he was capering on the spot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I wonder what else Gytha Ogg noticed? she thought, intrigued.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He rubbed his arm and gave her a lopsided grin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose you haven't got any idea where we are?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Witches never get lost,' said Magrat firmly. 'Although they can become temporarily mislaid. Lancre's over <em class="calibre10">that</em> way, I think. I've got to find a hill, if you'll excuse me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'To see where you are?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'To see when, I think. There's a lot of magic going on tonight.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is there? Then I think I'll accompany you,' the Fool added chivalrously, after peering cautiously into the tree-haunted gloom that apparently lay between him and his flagstones. 'I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny lay low over the broomstick as it plunged through the trackless chasms of the mountains, leaning from side to side in the nope that this might have some effect on the steering which seemed, strangely, to be getting worse. Falling snow behind her was whipped and spiralled into odd shapes by the wind of her passage. Rearing waves of crusted snow, poised all winter over the glacial valleys, trembled and then began the long, silent fall. Her flight was punctuated by the occasional boom of an avalanche.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked down at a landscape of sudden death and jagged beauty, and knew it was looking back at her, as a dozing man may watch a mosquito. She wondered if it realised what she was doing. She wondered if it'd make her fall any softer, and mentally scolded herself for such softness. No, the land wasn't like that. It didn't bargain. The land gave hard, and took hard. A dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then she was through, vaulting so low over the last peak that one of her boots filled with snow, and barrelling down towards the lowlands.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The mist, never far away in the mountains, was back again, but this time it was making a fight of it and had become a thick, silver sea in front of her. She groaned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Somewhere in the middle of it Nanny Ogg floated, taking the occasional pull from a hip flask as a preventative against the chill.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And thus it was that Granny, her hat and iron-grey hair dripping with moisture, her boots shedding lumps of ice, heard the distant and muffled sound of a voice enthusiastically explaining to the invisible sky that the hedgehog had less to worry over than just about any other mammal. Like a hawk that has spotted something small and fluffy in the grass, like a wandering interstellar flu germ that has just seen a nice blue planet drifting by, Granny turned the stick and plunged down through the choking billows.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come on!' she screamed, drunk with speed and exhilaration, and the sound from five hundred feet overhead put a passing wolf severely off its supper. 'This minute, Gytha Ogg!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg caught her hand with considerable reluctance and the pair of broomsticks swept up again and into the clear, starlit sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Disc, as always, gave the impression that the Creator has designed it specifically to be looked at from above. Streamers of cloud in white and silver stretched away to the rim, stirred into thousand-mile swirls by the turning of the world. Behind the speeding brooms the sullen roof of the fog was dragged up into a curling tunnel of white vapour, so that the watching gods – and they were certainly watching – could see the terrible flight as a furrow in the sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A thousand feet and rising fast into the frosty air, the two witches were bickering again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was a bloody stupid idea,' moaned Nanny. 'I never liked heights.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you bring something to drink?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly. You said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I drank it, didn't I,' said Nanny. 'Sitting around up there at my age. Our Jason would have a fit.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny gritted her teeth. 'Well, let's have the power,' she said. 'I'm running out of up. Amazing how—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's voice ended in a scream as; without any warning at all, her broomstick pinwheeled sharply across the clouds and dropped from sight. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool and Magrat sat on a log on a small outcrop that looked out across the forest. The lights of Lancre town were in fact not very far away, but neither of them had suggested leaving.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The air between them crackled with unspoken thoughts and wild surmisings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've been a Fool long?' said Magrat, politely. She blushed in the darkness. In that atmosphere it sounded the most impolite of questions.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All my life,' said the Fool bitterly. 'I cut my teeth on a set of bells.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose it gets handed on, from father to son?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I never saw much of my father. He went off to be Fool for the Lords of Quirm when I was small,' said the Fool. 'Had a row with my grandad. He comes back from time to time, to see my mam.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's terrible.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a sad jingle as the Fool shrugged. He vaguely recalled his father as a short, friendly little man, with eyes like a couple of oysters. Doing something as brave as standing up to the old boy must have been quite outside his nature. The sound of two suits of bells shaken in anger still haunted his memory, which was full enough of bad scenes as it was.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Still,' said Magrat, her voice higher than usual and with a vibrato of uncertainty, 'it must be a happy life. Making people laugh, I mean.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When there was no reply she turned to look at the man. His face was like stone. In a low voice, talking as though she was not there, the Fool spoke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He spoke of the Guild of Fools and Joculators in Ankh-Morpork.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Most visitors mistook it at first sight for the offices of the Guild of Assassins, which in fact was the rather pleasant,- airy collection of buildings next door (the Assassins always had plenty of money); sometimes the young Fools, slaving at their rote in rooms that were always freezing, even in high summer, heard the young Assassins at play over the wall and envied them, even though, of course, the number of piping voices grew noticeably fewer towards the end of term (the Assassins also believed in competitive examination).</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact all sorts of sounds managed to breach the high grim windowless walls, and from keen questioning of servants the younger Fools picked up a vision of the city beyond. There were taverns out there, and parks. There was a whole bustling world, in which the students and apprentices of the various Guilds and Colleges took a full ripe part, either by playing tricks on it, running through it shouting, or throwing parts of it up. There was laughter which paid no attention to the Five Cadences or Twelve Inflections. And – although the students debated this news in the dormitories at night – there was apparently unauthorised humour, delivered freestyle, with no reference to the <em class="calibre10">Monster Fun Book</em> or the Council or anyone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Out there, beyond the stained stonework, people were telling jokes without reference to the Lords of Misrule.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a sobering thought. Well, not a sobering thought in actual fact, because alcohol wasn't allowed in the Guild. But if it was, it would have been.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was nowhere more sober than the Guild.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool spoke bitterly of the huge, redfaced Brother Prankster, of evenings learning the Merry Jests, of long mornings in the freezing gymnasium learning the Eighteen Pratfalls and the accepted trajectory for a custard pie. And juggling. Juggling! Brother Jape, a man with a soul like cold boiled string, taught juggling. It wasn't that the Fool was bad at juggling that reduced him to incoherent fury. Fools were <em class="calibre10">expected</em> to be bad at juggling, especially if juggling inherently funny items like custard pies, flaming torches or extremely sharp cleavers. What had Brother Jape laying about him in red-hot, clanging rage was the fact that the Fool was bad at juggling <em class="calibre10">because he wasn 't any good at it.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Didn't you want to be anything else?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What else is there?' said the Fool. 'I haven't seen anything else I could be.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Student Fools were allowed out, in the last year of training, but under a fearsome set of restrictions. Capering miserably through the streets he'd seen wizards for the first time, moving like dignified carnival floats. He'd seen the surviving assassins, foppish, giggling young men in black silk, as sharp as knives underneath; he'd seen priests, their fantastic costumes only slightly marred by the long rubber sacrificial aprons they wore for major services. Every trade and profession had its costume, he saw, and he realised for the first time that the uniform he was wearing had been carefully and meticulously designed for no other purpose than making its wearer look like a complete and utter pillock.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even so, he'd persevered. He'd spent his whole life persevering.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He persevered precisely because he had absolutely no talent, and because grandfather would have flayed him alive if he didn't. He memorised the authorised jokes until his head rang, and got up even earlier in the morning to juggle until his elbows creaked. He had perfected his grasp of the comic vocabulary until only the very senior Lords could understand him. He'd capered and clowned with an impenetrable grim determination and he'd graduated top of his year and had been awarded the Bladder of Honour. He'd dropped it down the privy when he came home.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was silent.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool said, 'How did you get to be a witch?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Um?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean, did you go to a school or something?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. No. Goodie Whemper just walked down to the village one day, got all us girls lined up, and chose me. You don't choose the Craft, you see. It chooses you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but when do you actually become a witch?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When the other witches treat you as one, I suppose.' Magrat sighed. 'If they ever do,' she added. 'I thought they would after I did that spell in the corridor. It was pretty good, after all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, t'was a rite of passage,' said the Fool, unable to stop himself. Magrat gave him a blank look. He coughed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The other witches being those two old ladies?' he said, relapsing into his usual gloom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very strong characters, I imagine.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very,' said Magrat, with feeling.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wonder if they ever met my grandad,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked at her feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They're quite nice really,' she said. 'It's just that, well, when you're a witch you don't think about other people. I mean, you <em class="calibre10">think</em> about them, but you don't actually think about their feelings, if you see what I mean. </span>At least, not unless you think about it.' She looked at her feet again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're not like that,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look, I wish you'd stop working for the duke,' said Magrat desperately. 'You know what he's like. Torturing people and setting fire to their cottages and everything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I'm his Fool,' said the Fool. 'A Fool has to be loyal to his master. Right up until he dies. I'm afraid it's tradition. Tradition is very important.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you don't even like being a Fool!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I hate it. But that's got nothing to do with it. If I've got to be a Fool, I'll do it properly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's really stupid,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Foolish, I'd prefer.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool had been edging along the log. 'If I kiss you,' he added carefully, 'do I turn into a frog?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked down at her feet again. They shuffled themselves under her dress, embarrassed at all this attention.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She could sense the shades of Gytha Ogg and Esme Weatherwax on either side of her. Granny's spectre glared at her. <em class="calibre10">A witch is master of every situation,</em> it said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>Mistress,</span>
        </em>
        <span> said the vision of Nanny Ogg, and made a brief gesture involving much grinning and waving of forearms.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We shall have to see,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was destined to be the most impressive kiss in the history of foreplay.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Time, as Granny Weatherwax had pointed out, is a subjective experience. The Fool's years in the Guild had been an eternity whereas the hours with Magrat on the hilltop passed like a couple of minutes. And, high above Lancre, a double handful of seconds extended like taffy into hours of screaming terror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ice!' screamed Granny. 'It's iced up!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg came alongside, trying vainly to match courses with the tumbling, bucking broomstick. Octarine fire crackled over the frozen bristles, shorting them out at random. She leaned over and snatched a handful of Granny's skirt.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I tole you it was daft!' she shouted. 'You went all through all that wet mist and then up into the cold air, you daft besom!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You let go of my skirt, Gytha Ogg!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come on, grab hold o'mine. You're on fire at the back there!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They shot through the bottom of the cloud bank and screamed in unison as the shrub-covered ground emerged from nowhere and aimed itself directly at them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And <em class="calibre10">went past.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny looked down a black perspective at the bottom of which a boil of white water was dimly visible. They had flown over the edge of Lancre Gorge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Blue smoke was pouring out of Granny's broomstick but she hung on, determined, and forced it around.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What the hell you doing?' roared Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can follow the river,' Granny Weatherwax screamed, above the crackle of flames. 'Don't you worry!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You come aboard, d'you hear? It's all over, you can't do it . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a small explosion behind Granny and several handfuls of burning bristles broke off and whirled away into the booming depths of the gorge. Her stick jerked sideways and Nanny grabbed her around the shoulders as a gout of fire snapped another binding.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The blazing broomstick shot from between her legs, twisted in the air, and went straight upwards, trailing sparks and making a noise like a wet finger dragged around the top of a wineglass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This left Nanny flying upside down, supporting Granny Weatherwax at arm's length. They stared into one another's face and screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can't pull you up!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I can't climb up, can I? Act your age, Gytha!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny considered this. Then she let go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Three marriages and an adventurous girlhood had left Nanny Ogg with thigh muscles that could crack coconuts, and the G-forces sucked at her as she forced the speeding stick down and around in a tight loop.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Ahead of her she made out Granny Weatherwax dropping like a stone, one hand clutching her hat, the other trying to prevent gravity from seeing up her skirts. She urged the stick forwards until it creaked, snatched the falling witch around the waist, fought the plunging stick back up to level flight, and sagged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The subsequent silence was broken by Granny Weatherwax saying, 'Don't you ever do that again, Gytha Ogg.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I promise.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Now turn us around. We're heading for Lancre Bridge, remember?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny obediently turned the broomstick, brushing the canyon walls as she did so.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's still miles to go,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean to do it,' said Granny. 'There's plenty of night left.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not enough, I'm thinking.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A witch doesn't know the meaning of the word "failure". Gytha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They shot up into the clear air again. The horizon was a line of golden light as the slow dawn of the Disc sped across the land, bulldozing the suburbs of the night.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Esme?' said Nanny Ogg, after a while.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It means "lack of success".'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They flew in chilly silence for several seconds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was speaking wossname. Figuratively,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. Well. You should of said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The line of light was bigger, brighter. For the first time a flicker of doubt invaded Granny Weatherwax's mind, puzzled to find itself in such unfamiliar surroundings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wonder how many cockerels there are in Lancre?' she said quietly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Was that one of them wossname questions?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was just wondering.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg sat back. There were thirty-two of crowing age, she knew. She knew because she'd worked it out last night – <em class="calibre10">tonight -</em> and had given Jason his instructions. She had fifteen grown-up children and innumerable grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and they'd had most of the evening to get into position. It should be enough.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you hear that?' said Granny. 'Over Razorback way?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny looked innocently across the misty landscape. Sound travelled very clearly in these early hours.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sort of an "urk" noise?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny spun around.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Over there,' she said. 'I definitely heard it this time. Something like "cock-a-doo-arrgh".'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can't say I did, Esme,' said Nanny, smiling at the sky. 'Lancre Bridge up ahead.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And over there! Right down there! It was a definite squawk!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Dawn chorus, Esme, I expect. Look, only half a mile to go.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny glared at the back of her colleague's head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's something going on here,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Search me, Esme.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your shoulders are shaking!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lost my shawl back there. I'm a bit chilly. Look, we're nearly there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny glared ahead, her mind a maze of suspicions. She was going to get to the bottom of this. When she had time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The damp logs of Lancre's main link to the outside world drifted gently underneath them. From the chicken farm half a mile away came a chorus of strangled squawks and a thud.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And that? What was that, then?' demanded Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fowl pest. Careful, I'm bringing us down.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you laughing at me?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just pleased for you, Esme. You'll go down in history for this, you know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They drifted between the timbers of the bridge. Granny Weatherwax alighted cautiously on the greasy planking and adjusted her dress.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. Well,' she added, nonchalantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Better than Black Aliss, everyone'll say,' Nanny Ogg went on.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Some people will say anything,' said Granny. She peered over the parapet at the foaming torrent far below, and then up at the distant outcrop on which stood Lancre Castle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you think they will?' she added, nonchalantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mark my words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hmm.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you've got to complete the spell, mind.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax nodded. She turned to face the dawn, raised her arms, and completed the spell. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It is almost impossible to convey the sudden passage of fifteen years and two months in words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It's a lot easier in pictures, when you just use a calendar with lots of pages blowing off, or a clock with hands moving faster and faster until they blur, or trees bursting into blossom and fruiting in a matter of seconds . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Well, <em class="calibre10">you</em> know. Or the sun becomes a fiery streak across the sky, and days and nights flicker past jerkily like a bad zoetrope, and the fashions visible in the clothes shop across the road whip on and off faster than a lunchtime stripper with five pubs to do.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There are any amount of ways, but they won't be required because, in fact, none of this happened.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The sun <em class="calibre10">did</em> jerk sideways a bit, and it seemed that the trees on the rimward side of the gorge were rather taller, and Nanny couldn't shake off the sensation that someone had just sat down heavily on her, squashed her flat, and then opened her out again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This was because the kingdom did not, in so many words, move through time in the normal flickering sky, high-speed photography sense of the word. It moved around it, which is much cleaner, considerably easier to achieve, and saves all that travelling around trying to find a laboratory opposite a dress shop that will keep the same dummy in the window for sixty years, which has traditionally been the most time-consuming and expensive bit of the whole business.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The kiss lasted more than fifteen years.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Not even frogs can manage that.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool drew back, his eyes glazed, his expression one of puzzlement.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you feel the world move?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat peered over his shoulder at the forest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think she's done it,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Done what?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat hesitated. 'Oh. Nothing. Nothing much, really.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shall we have another try? I don't think we got it quite right that time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat nodded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This time it lasted only fifteen seconds. It seemed longer. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A tremor ran through the castle, shaking the breakfast tray from which the Duke Felmet, much to his relief, was eating porridge that wasn't too salty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was felt by the ghosts that now filled Nanny Ogg's cottage like a rugby team in a telephone box.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It spread to every henhouse in the kingdom, and a number of hands relaxed their grip. And thirty-two purple-faced cockerels took a deep bream and crowed like maniacs, but they were too late, too late ...  </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I still reckon you were up to something,' said Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Have another cup of tea,' said Nanny pleasantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You won't go and put any drink in it, will you,' Granny said flatly. 'It was the drink what did it last night. I would never have put myself forward like that. It's shameful.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Black Aliss never done anything like it,' said Nanny, encouragingly. 'I mean, it was a hundred years, all right, but it was only one castle she moved. I reckon anyone could do a castle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's frown puckered at the edge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And she let all weeds grow over it,' she observed primly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right enough.'</span>

        <span>'Very well done,' said King Verence, eagerly. 'We all thought it was superb. Being in the ethereal plane, of course, we were in a position to observe closely.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very good, your graciousness,' said Nanny Ogg. She turned and observed the crowding ghosts behind him, who hadn't been granted the privilege of sitting at, or partly through, the kitchen table.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you lot can bugger off back to the outhouse,' she said. 'The cheek! Except the kiddies, they can stay,' she added. 'Poor little mites.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I am afraid it feels so good to be out of the castle,' said the king.</span>

        <span>Granny Weatherwax yawned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway,' she said, 'we've got to find the boy now. That's the next step.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We shall look for him directly after lunch.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lunch?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's chicken,' said Nanny. 'And you're tired. Besides, making a decent search will take a long time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He'll be in Ankh-Morpork,' said Granny. 'Mark my words. Everyone ends up there. We'll start with Ankh-Morpork. You don't have to search for people when destiny is involved, you just wait for them in Ankh-Morpork.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny brightened up. 'Our Karen got married to an innkeeper from there,' she said. 'I haven't seen the baby yet. We could get free board and everything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We needn't actually go. The whole point is that he should come <em class="calibre10">here.</em> There's something about that city,' said Granny. 'It's like a drain.'  </span>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No. Nothing like that. Not as bad as that.' The Fool hesitated. He'd introduced Felmet to the world of words. Surely that was better than hitting people with swords? Wouldn't that buy time? Wouldn't it be best for everybody, in the circumstances?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, yes. But I still have to do it. I gave my word.'</span>

        <span>Magrat came close to stamping her foot, but didn't sink so low.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

        <span>Hwel pinched the bridge of his nose and squinted wearily at the wax-spattered paper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The play wasn't going at all well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd sorted out the falling chandelier, and found a place for a villain who wore a mask to conceal his disfigurement, and he'd rewritten one of the funny bits to allow for the fact that the hero had been born in a handbag. It was the clowns who were giving him trouble again. They kept changing every time he thought about them. He preferred them in twos, that was traditional, but now there seemed to be a third one, and he was blowed if he could think of any funny lines for him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His quill moved scratchily over the latest sheet of paper, trying to catch the voices that had streamed through his dreaming mind and had seemed so funny at the time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His tongue began to stick out of the corner of his mouth. He was sweating.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel stared at this in horror. On the page it looked nonsensical, ridiculous. And yet, and yet, in the thronged auditorium of his mind . . .</span>
      </div>

        <span>He dipped the quill in the inkpot, and chased the echoes further.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel gave up. Yes, it was funny, he <em class="calibre10">knew</em> it was funny, he'd heard the laughter in his dreams. But it wasn't right. Not yet. Maybe never. It was like the other idea about the two clowns, one fat, one thin . . . </span>
        <em class="calibre10">Thys ys amain Dainty Messe youe have got me into, Stanleigh</em> . . . He had laughed until his chest ached, and the rest of the company had looked at him in astonishment. <span>But in his dreams it was hilarious.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He laid down the pen and rubbed his eyes. It must be nearly midnight, and the habit of a lifetime told him to spare the candles although, for a fact, they could afford all the candles they could eat now, whatever Vitoller might say.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hour gongs were being struck all across the city and nightwatchmen were proclaiming that it was indeed midnight and also that, in the face of all the evidence, all was well. Many of them got as far as the end of the sentence before being mugged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel pushed open the shutters and looked out at Ankh-Morpork.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It would be tempting to say the twin city was at its best this time of year, but that wouldn't be entirely correct. It was at its most <em class="calibre10">typical.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The river Ankh, the cloaca of half a continent, was already pretty wide and silt laden when it reached the city's outskirts. By the time it left it didn't so much flow as exude. Owing to the accretion of the mud of centuries the bed of the river was in fact higher than some of the low lying areas and now, with the snow melt swelling the flow, many of the low-rent districts on the Morpork side were flooded, if you can use that word for a liquid you could pick up in a net. This sort of thing happened every year and would have caused havoc with the drains and sewage systems, so it is just as well that the city didn't have very many. Its inhabitants merely kept a punt handy in the back yard and, periodically, built another storey on the house.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was reckoned to be very healthy there. Very few germs were able to survive.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked across a sort of misty sea in which buildings clustered like a sandcastle competition at high tide. Flares and lighted windows made pleasing patterns on the iridescent surface, but there was one glare of light, much closer to hand, which particularly occupied his attention.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On a patch of slightly higher ground by the river, bought by Vitoller for a ruinous sum, a new building was rising. It was growing even by night, like a mushroom – Hwel could see the cressets burning all along the scaffolding as the hired craftsmen and even some of the players themselves refused to let the mere shade of the sky interrupt their labours.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>New buildings were rare in Morpork, but this was even a new <em class="calibre10">type</em> of building.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The <em class="calibre10">Dysk.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller had been aghast at the idea at first, but young Tomjon had kept at him. And everyone knew that once the lad had got the feel of it he could persuade water to flow uphill.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we've <em class="calibre10">always</em> moved around, laddie,' said Vitoller, in the desperate voice of one who knows that, at the end of it all, he's going to lose the argument. 'I can't go around settling down at my time of life.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not doing you any good,' said Tomjon firmly. 'All these cold nights and frosty mornings. You're not getting any younger. We should stay put somewhere, and let people come to us. And they will, too. You know the crowds we're getting now. Hwel's plays are famous.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not my plays,' Hwel had said. 'It's the players.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can't see me sitting by a fire in a stuffy room and sleeping on feather beds and all that nonsense,' said Vitoller, but he'd seen the look on his wife's face and had given in.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then there had been the theatre itself. Making water run uphill was a parlour trick compared to getting the cash out of Vitoller but, it was a fact, they had been doing well these days. Ever since Tomjon had been big enough to wear a ruff and say two words without his voice cracking.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel and Vitoller had watched the first few beams of the wooden framework go up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's against nature,' Vitoller had complained, leaning on his stick. 'Capturing the spirit of the theatre, putting it in a cage. It'll kill it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, I don't know,' said Hwel diffidently. Tomjon had laid his plans well, he'd devoted an entire evening to Hwel before even broaching the subject to his father, and now the dwarfs mind was on fire with the possibilities of backdrops and scenery changes and wings and flies and magnificent engines that could lower gods from the heavens and trapdoors that could raise demons from hell. Hwel was no more capable of objecting to the new theatre than a monkey was of resenting a banana plantation.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Damn thing hasn't even got a name,' Vitoller had said. 'I should call it the <em class="calibre10">Golde Mine,</em> because that's what it's costing me. Where's the money going to come from, that's what I'd like to know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact they'd tried a lot of names, none of which suited Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's got to be a name that means everything,' he said. 'Because there's everything inside it. The whole world on the stage, do you see?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And Hwel had said, knowing as he said it that what he was saying was exactly right, 'The Disc.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And now the Dysk was nearly done, and still he hadn't written the new play.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He shut the window and wandered back to his desk, picked up the quill, and pulled another sheet of paper towards him. A thought struck him. The whole world <em class="calibre10">was</em> a stage, to the gods . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Presently he began to write.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>All the Disc it is but an Theater,</span>
        </em>
        <span> he wrote, <em class="calibre10">Aite alle men and wymmen are but Players.</em> He made the mistake of pausing, and another inspiration sleeted down, sending his train of thought off along an entirely new track.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He looked at what he had written and added: <em class="calibre10">Except Those who selle popcorn.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a while he crossed this out, and tried: <em class="calibre10">Like unto thee Staje of a Theater ys the World, whereon alle Persons strut as Players.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This seemed a bit better.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He thought for a bit, and continued conscientiously: <em class="calibre10">Sometimes they walke on. Sometimes they walke off.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He seemed to be losing it. Time, time, what he needed was an infinity . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a muffled cry and a thump from the next room. Hwel dropped the quill and pushed open the door cautiously.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The boy was sitting up in bed, white-faced. He relaxed when Hwel came in.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hwel?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's up, lad? Nightmares?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Gods, it was terrible! I saw them again! I really thought for a minute that—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel, who was absent-mindedly picking up the clothes that Tomjon had strewn around the room, paused in his work. He was keen on dreams. That was when the ideas came.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That what?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'It was like . . . I mean, I was sort of <em class="calibre10">inside</em> something, like a bowl, and there were these three terrible faces peering in at me.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aye?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, and then they all said, "All hail . . ." and then they started arguing about my name, and then they said, "Anyway, who shall be king hereafter?" And then one of them said, "Here after what?" and one of the other two said, "Just hereafter, girl, it's what you're supposed to say in these circumstances, you might try and make an effort", and then they all peered closer, and one of the others said, "He looks a bit peaky, I reckon it's all that foreign food", and then the youngest one said, "Nanny, I've told you already, there's no such place as Thespia", and then they bickered a bit, and one of the old ones said, "He can't hear us, can he? He's tossing and turning a bit", and the other one said, "You know I've never been able to get sound on this thing, Esme", and then they bickered some more, and it went cloudy, and then . . . </span>I woke up . . .' he finished lamely. <span>'It was horrible, because every time they came close to the bowl it sort of magnified everything, so all you could see was eyes and nostrils.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel hoisted himself on to the edge of the narrow bed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Funny old things, dreams,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not much funny about that one.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, but I mean, last night, I had this dream about a little bandy-legged man walking down a road,' said Hwel. 'He had a little black hat on, and he walked as though his boots were full of water.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nodded politely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' he said. 'And—?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, that was it. And nothing. He had this little cane which he twirled and, you know, it was incredibly . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarfs voice trailed off. Tomjon's face had that familiar expression of polite and slightly condescending puzzlement that Hwel had come to know and dread.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway, it was very amusing,' he said, half to himself. But he knew he'd never convince the rest of the company. If it didn't have a custard pie in it somewhere, they said, it wasn't funny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon swung his legs out of bed and reached for his britches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm not going back to sleep,' he said. 'What's the time?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's after midnight,' said Hwel. 'And you know what your father said about going to bed late.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm not,' said Tomjon, pulling on his boots. Tm getting up early. Getting up early is very healthy. And now I'm going out for a very healthy drink. You can come too,' he added, 'to keep an eye on me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel gave him a doubting look.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You also know what your father says about going out drinking,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. He said he used to do it all the time when he was a lad. He said he'd think nothing of quaffing ale all night and coming home at 5 a.m., smashing windows. He said he was a bit of a roister-doister, not like these white-livered people today who can't hold their drink.' Tomjon adjusted his doublet in front of the mirror, and added, 'You know, Hwel, I reckon responsible behaviour is something to get when you grow older. Like varicose veins.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel sighed. Tomjon's memory for ill-judged remarks was legendary.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' he said. 'Just the one, though. Somewhere decent.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'I promise.' Tomjon adjusted his hat. <span>It had a feather in it.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'By the way,' he said, 'exactly how does one quaff?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think it means you spill most of it,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>If the water of the river Ankh was rather thicker and more full of personality than ordinary river water, so the air in the Mended Drum was more crowded than normal air. It was like dry fog.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon and Hwel watched it spilling out into the street. The door burst open and a man came through backwards, not actually touching the ground until he hit the wall on the opposite side of the street.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>An enormous troll, employed by the owners to keep a measure of order in the place, came out dragging two more limp bodies which he deposited on the cobbles, kicking them once or twice in soft places.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I reckon they're roistering in there, don't you?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It looks like it,' said Hwel. He shivered. He hated taverns. People always put their drinks down on his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They scurried in quickly while the troll was holding one unconscious drinker up by one leg and banging his head on the cobbles in a search for concealed valuables.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Drinking in the Drum has been likened to diving in a swamp, except that in a swamp the alligators don't pick your pockets first. Two hundred eyes watched the pair as they pushed their way through the crowd to the bar, a hundred mouths paused in the act of drinking, cursing or pleading, and ninety-nine brows crinkled with the effort of working out whether the newcomers fell into category A, people to be frightened of or B, people to frighten.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon walked through the crowd as though it was his property and, with the impetuosity of youth, rapped on the bar. Impetuosity was not a survival trait in the Mended Drum.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Two pints of your finest ale, landlord,' he said, in tones so carefully judged that the barman was astonished to find himself obediently filling the first mug before the echoes had died away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked up. There was an extremely big man on his right, wearing the outside of several large bulls and more chains than necessary to moor a warship. A face that looked like a building site with hair on it glared down at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bloody hell,' it said. 'It's a bloody lawn ornament.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel went cold. Cosmopolitan as they were, the people of Morpork had a breezy, no-nonsense approach to the non-human races, i.e., hit them over the head with a brick and throw them in the river. This did not apply to trolls, naturally, because it is very difficult to be racially prejudiced against creatures seven feet tall who can bite through walls, at least for very long. But people three feet high were absolutely <em class="calibre10">designed</em> to be discriminated against.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The giant prodded Hwel on the top of his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where's your fishing rod, lawn ornament?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The barman pushed the mugs across the puddled counter.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here you are,' he said, leering. 'One pint. And one half pint.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon opened his mouth to speak, but Hwel nudged him sharply in the knee. Put up with it, put up with it, slip out as soon as possible, it was the only way . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where's your little pointy hat, then?' said the bearded man.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The room had gone quiet. This looked like being cabaret time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">said,</em> where's your pointy hat, dopey?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The barman got a grip of the blackthorn stick with nails in which lived under the counter, just in case, and said, 'Er—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was talking to the lawn ornament here.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The man took the dregs of his own drink and poured them carefully over the silent dwarfs head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I ain't drinking here again,' he muttered, when even this tailed to have any effect. 'It's bad enough they let monkeys drink here, but pygmies—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Now the silence in the bar took on a whole new intensity in which the sound of a stool being slowly pushed back was like the creak of doom. All eyes swivelled to the other end of the room, where sat the one drinker in the Mended Drum who came into category C.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>What Tomjon had thought was an old sack hunched over the bar was extending arms and – other arms, except that they were its legs. A sad, rubbery face turned towards the speaker, its expression as melancholy as the mists of evolution. Its funny lips curled back. There was abolutely nothing funny about its teeth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Er,' said the barman again, his voice frightening even him in that terrible simian silence. 'I don't think you meant that, did you? Not about monkeys, eh? You didn't really, did you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What the hell's that?' hissed Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think it's an orang-utan,' said Hwel. 'An ape.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A monkey's a monkey,' said the bearded man, at which several of the Drum's more percipient customers started to edge for the door. 'I mean, so what? But these bloody lawn ornaments—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel's fist struck out at groin height.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dwarfs have a reputation as fearsome fighters. Any race of three-foot tall people who favour axes and go into battle as into a championship tree-felling competition soon get talked about. But years of wielding a pen instead of a hammer had relieved Hwel's punches of some of their stopping power, and it could have been the end of him when the big man yelled and drew his sword if a pair of delicate, leathery hands hadn't instantly jerked the thing from his grip and, with only a small amount of effort, bent it double<a href="#note_16" title="An explanation may be needed at this point. The Librarian of the magic library at Unseen University, the Disc's premier college of wizardry, had been turned into an orang-utan some years previously by a magical accident in that accident-prone academy, and since then had strenuously resisted all well-meaning efforts to turn him back. For one thing, longer arms and prehensile toes made getting around the higher shelves a whole lot easier, and being an ape meant you didn't have to bother with all this angst business. He had also been rather pleased to find that his new body, although looking deceptively like a rubber sack full of water, gave him three times the strength and twice the reach of his old one."><sup class="calibre11">[16]</sup></a>.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When the giant growled, and turned around, an arm like a couple of broom handles strung together with elastic and covered with red fur unfolded itself in a complicated motion and smacked him across the jaw so hard that he rose several inches in the air and landed on a table.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>By the time that the table had slid into another table and overturned a couple of benches there was enough impetus to start the night's overdue brawl, especially since the big man had a few friends with him. Since no-one felt like attacking the ape, who had dreamily pulled a bottle from the shelf and smashed the bottom off on the counter, they hit whoever happened to be nearest, on general principles. This is absolutely correct etiquette for a tavern brawl.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel walked under a table and dragged Tomjon, who was watching all this with interest, after him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So this is roistering. I always wondered.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think perhaps it would be a good idea to leave,' said the dwarf firmly. 'Before there's, you know, any trouble.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a thump as someone landed on the table above them, and a tinkle of broken glass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is it real roistering, do you suppose, or merely rollicking?' said Tomjon, grinning.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's going to be bloody murder in a minute, my lad!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nodded, and crawled back out into the fray. Hwel heard him thump on the bar counter with something and call for silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel put his arms over his head in panic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't mean—' he began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact calling for silence was a sufficiently rare event in the middle of a tavern brawl that silence was what Tomjon got. And silence was what he filled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel started as he heard the boy's voice ring out, full of confidence and absolutely first-class projection.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Brothers! And yet may I call all men brother, for on this night—'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf craned up to see Tomjon standing on a chair, one hand raised in the prescribed declamatory fashion. Around him men were frozen in the act of giving one another a right seeing-to, their faces turned to his.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Down at tabletop height Hwel's lips moved in perfect synchronisation with the words as Tomjon went through the familiar speech. He risked another look.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The fighters straightened up, pulled themselves together, adjusted the hang of their tunics, glanced apologetically at one another. Many of them were in fact standing to attention.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even Hwel felt a fizz in his blood, and he'd written those words. He'd slaved half a night over them, years ago, when Vitoller had declared that they needed another five minutes in Act III of <em class="calibre10">The King of Ankh.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Scribble us something with a bit of spirit in it,' he'd said. 'A bit of zip and sizzle, y'know. Something to summon up the blood and put a bit of backbone in our friends in the ha'penny seats. And just long enough to give us time to change the set.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd been a bit ashamed of that play at the time. The famous Battle of Morpork, he strongly suspected, had consisted of about two thousand men lost in a swamp on a cold, wet day, hacking one another into oblivion with rusty swords. What would the last King of Ankh have said to a pack of ragged men who knew they were outnumbered, outflanked and outgeneralled? Something with bite, something with edge, something like a drink of brandy to a dying man; no logic, no explanation, just words that would reach right down through a tired man's brain and pull him to his feet by his testicles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Now he was seeing its effect.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He began to think the walls had fallen away, and there was a cold mist blowing over the marshes, its choking silence broken only by the impatient cries of the carrion birds . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And this voice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And he'd written the words, they were <em class="calibre10">his,</em> no half-crazed king had ever really spoken like this. And he'd written all this to fill in a gap so that a castle made of painted sacking stretched over a frame could be shoved behind a curtain, and this voice was taking the coal dust of his words and filling the room with diamonds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I <em class="calibre10">made</em> these words, Hwel thought. But they don't belong to me. They belong to him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Look at those people. Not a patriotic thought among them, but if Tomjon asked them, this bunch of drunkards would storm die Patrician's palace tonight. And they'd probably succeed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I just hope his mouth never falls into the wrong hands . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>As the last syllables died away, their white-hot echoes searing across every mind in the room, Hwel shook himself and crawled out of hiding and jabbed Tomjon on the knee.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come away now, you fool,' he hissed. 'Before it wears off.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He grasped the boy firmly by the arm, handed a couple of complimentary tickets to the stunned barman, and hurried up the steps. He didn't stop until they were a street away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought I was doing rather well there,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A good deal too well, I reckon.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The boy rubbed his hands together. 'Right. Where shall we go next?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Next?'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tonight is young!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, <em class="calibre10">tonight</em> is dead. It's <em class="calibre10">today</em> that's young,' said the dwarf hurriedly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I'm not going home yet. Isn't there somewhere a bit more friendly? We haven't actually drunk anything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel sighed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A troll tavern,' said Tomjon. 'I've heard about them. There's some down in the Shades<a href="#note_17" title="The Shades is an ancient part of Ankh-Morpork considered considerably more unpleasant and disreputable than the rest of the city. This always amazes visitors. "><sup class="calibre11">[17]</sup></a>. </span>
        <span>
          <span>I'd like to see a troll tavern.'</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They're for trolls only, boy. Molten lava to drink and rock music and cheese 'n' chutney flavoured pebbles.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What about dwarf bars?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You'd hate it,' said Hwel, fervently. 'Besides, you'd run out of headroom.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Low dives, are they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look at it like this – how long do you think you could sing about gold?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "It's yellow and it goes chink and you can buy things with it," ' said Tomjon experimentally, as they strolled through the crowds on the Plaza of Broken Moons. 'Four seconds, I think.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right. Five hours of it gets a bit repetitive.' Hwel kicked a pebble gloomily. He'd investigated a few dwarf bars last time they were in town, and hadn't approved. For some reason his fellow expatriates, who at home did nothing more objectionable than mine a bit of iron ore and hunt small creatures, felt impelled, once in the big city, to wear chain mail underwear, go around with axes in their belts, and call themselves names like Timkin Rumbleguts. And no-one could beat a city dwarf when it came to quaffing. Sometimes they missed their mouths altogether.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway,' he added, 'you'd get thrown out for being too creative. The actual words are, "Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold".'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is there a chorus?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold",' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You left out a "gold" there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think it's because I wasn't cut out to be a dwarf.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cut <em class="calibre10">down,</em> lawn ornament,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a little hiss of indrawn breath.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry,' said Tomjon hurriedly. 'It's just that father—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I've known your father for a long time,' said Hwel 'Through thick and thin, and there was a damn sight more thin than thick. Since before you were bor—' He hesitated 'Times were hard in those days,' he mumbled. 'So what I'm saying is ... well, some things you earn.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. I'm sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You see, just—' Hwel paused at the mouth of a dark alley 'Did you hear something?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They squinted into the alley, once again revealing themselves as newcomers to the city. Morporkians don't look down dark alleys when they hear strange noises. If they see four struggling figures their first instinct is not to rush to anyone's assistance, or at least not to rush to the assistance of the one who appears to be losing and on the wrong end of someone else's boot. Nor do they shout 'Oi!' Above all, they don't look surprised when the assailants, instead of guiltily running off. flourish a small piece of cardboard in front of them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's this?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a clown!' said Hwel. 'They've mugged a clown!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "Theft Licence"?' said Tomjon, holding the card up to the light.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right,' said the leader of the three. 'Only don't expect us to do you too, 'cos we're on our way home.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'S'right,' said one of his assistants. 'It's the thingy, the quota.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you were kicking him!'</span>

      </div>

        <span>'More foot nudging, sort of thing,' said the third thief.</span>

        <span>'Fair's fair. He bloody well went and fetched Ron here a right thump, didn't he?'</span>

I mean, we'd never have done for him, only it was on our way home. You try and do someone a favour, this is what happens.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How much has he got, then?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There must be a hundred silver dollars in here,' moaned Boggis, waving a purse. 'I mean, that's not my league. That's not my class. I can't handle that sort of money. You've got to be in the Guild of Lawyers or something to steal that much. It's way over my quota, is that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Give it back then,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I done him a receipt!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They've all got, you know, numbers on,' explained the younger of the nephews. 'The Guild checks up, sort of . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel grabbed Tomjon's hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Will you excuse us a moment?' he said to the frantic thief, and dragged Tomjon to the other side of the alley.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Okay,' he said. 'Who's gone mad? Them? Me? You?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon explained.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's legal?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Up to a certain point. Fascinating, isn't it? Man in a pub told me about it, sort of thing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But he's stolen <em class="calibre10">too much?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So it appears. I gather the Guild is very strict about it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a groan from the victim hanging between them. He tinkled gently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Look after him,' said Tomjon. 'I'll sort this out.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He went back to the thieves, who were looking very worried.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My client feels,' he said, 'that the situation could be resolved if you give the money back.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ye-es,' said Boggis, approaching the idea as if it was a brand new theory of cosmic creation. 'But it's the receipt. see, we have to fill it up, time and place, signed and everything . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My client feels that possibly you could rob him of, let us say, five copper pieces,' said Tomjon, smoothly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—I bloody don't!—' shouted the Fool, who was coming round.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>That represents two copper pieces as the going rate, plus expenses of three copper pieces for time, call-out fees—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wear and tear on cosh,' said Boggis.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Exactly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very fair. Very fair.' Boggis looked over Tomjon's head at the Fool, who was now completely conscious and very angry. 'Very fair,' he said loudly. 'Statesmanlike. Much obliged, I'm sure.' He looked down at Tomjon. 'And anything for yourself, sir?' he added. 'Just say the word. We've got a special on GBH this season. Practically painless, you'll barely feel a thing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hardly breaks the skin,' said the older nephew. 'Plus you get choice of limb.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I believe I am well served in that area,' said Tomjon smoothly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. Well. Right you are then. No problem.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Which merely leaves,' continued Tomjon, as the thieves started to walk away, 'the question of legal fees.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The gentle greyness at the stump of the night flowed across Ankh-Morpork. Tomjon and Hwel sat on either side of the table in their lodgings, counting.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Three silver dollars and eighteen copper pieces in profit, I make it,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That was amazing,' said the Fool. 'I mean, the way they volunteered to go home and get some more money as well, after you gave them that speech about the rights of man.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He dabbed some more ointment on his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And the youngest one started to cry,' he added. 'Amazing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It wears off,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're a dwarf, aren't you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel didn't feel he could deny this.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can tell you're a Fool,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. It's the bells, isn't it?' said the Fool wearily, rubbing his ribs.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes, and the bells.' Tomjon grimaced and kicked Hwel under die table.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I'm very grateful,' said the Fool. He stood up, and winced. 'I'd really like to show my gratitude,' he added. 'Is there a tavern open around here?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon joined him at the window, and pointed down the length of the street.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'See all those tavern signs?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. Gosh. There's hundreds.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right. See the one at the end, with the blue and white sign?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. I think so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, as far as I know, that's the only one around here that's ever closed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then pray allow me to treat you to a drink. It's the least I can do,' said the Fool nervously. 'And I'm sure the little fellow would like something to quaff.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel gripped the edge of the table and opened his mouth to roar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And stopped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stared at the two figures. His mouth stayed open.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It closed again with a snap.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Something the matter?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked away. It had been a long night. 'Trick of the light,' he muttered. 'And I could do with a drink,' he added. 'A bloody good quaff.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact, he thought, why fight it? 'I'll even put up with the singing,' he said. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Was' the nex' wor'?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'S'gold. I think.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked unsteadily into his mug. Drunkenness had this to be said for it, it stopped the flow of inspirations.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you left out the "gold",' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where?' said Tomjon. He was wearing the Fool's hat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel considered this. 'I reckon,' he said, concentrating, 'it was between the "gold" and the "gold". An' I reckon,' he peered again into the mug. It was. empty, a horrifying sight. 'I reckon,' he tried again, and finally gave up, and substituted, 'I reckon I could do with another drink.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My shout this time,' said the Fool. </span>'Hahaha. My squeak. Hahaha.' He tried to stand up, and banged his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In the gloom of the bar a dozen axes were gripped more firmly. The part of Hwel that was sober, and was horrified to see the rest of him being drunk, urged him to wave his hand at the beetling brows glaring at them through the gloom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'S'all right,' he said, to the bar at large. 'He don't mean it, he ver' funny wossname, idiot. Fool. Ver' funny Fool, all way from wassisplace.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Lancre,' said the Fool, and sat down heavily on the bar.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'S'right. Long way away from wossname, sounds like foot disease. Don't know how to behave. Don't know many dwarfs.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hahaha,' said the Fool, clutching his head. 'Bit <em class="calibre10">short</em> of them where I come from.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Someone tapped Hwel on the shoulder. He turned and looked into a craggy, hairy face under an iron helmet. The dwarf in question was tossing a throwing axe up and down in a meaningful way.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You ought to tell your friend to be a bit less funny,' he suggested. 'Otherwise he will be amusing the demons in Hell!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel squinted at him through the alcoholic haze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who're you?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Grabpot Thundergust,' said the dwarf, striking his chain-mailed torso. 'And I say—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel peered closer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here, I know you,' he said. 'You got a cosmetics mill down Hobfast Street. I bought a lot of greasepaint off you last week—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A look of panic crossed Thundergust's face. He leaned forward in panic. 'Shutup, shutup,' he whispered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right, it said the Halls of Elven Perfume and Rouge Co.,' said Hwel happily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ver' good stuff,' said Tomjon, who was trying to stop himself from sliding off the tiny bench. 'Especially your No. 19, Corpse Green, my father swears it's the best. First class.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf hefted-his axe uneasily. 'Well, er,' he said. 'Oh. But. Yes. Well, thank you. Only the finest ingredients, mark you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Chop them up with that, do you?' said Hwel innocently, pointing to the axe. 'Or is it your night off?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Thundergust's brows beetled again like a cockroach convention.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here, you're not with the theatre?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tha's us,' said Tomjon. </span>'Strolling players.' He corrected himself. <span>'Standing-still players now. Haha. Slidin'-down players now.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf dropped his axe and sat down on the bench, his face suddenly softened with enthusiasm.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I went last week,' he said. 'Bloody good, it was. There was this girl and this fellow, but she was married to this old man, and there was this other fellow, and they said he'd died, and she pined away and took poison, but then it turned out this man was the other man really, only he couldn't tell her on account of—' Thundergust stopped, and blew his nose. 'Everyone died in the end,' he said. 'Very tragic. I cried all the way home, I don't mind telling you. </span>She was so pale.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'No. 19 and a layer of powder,' said Tomjon cheerfully. 'Plus a bit of brown eyeshadow.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Eh?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'And a couple of hankies in the vest,' he added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What's he saying?' said the dwarf to the company at, for want of a better word, large.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hwel smiled into his tankard.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Give 'em a bit of Gretalina's soliloquy, boy,' he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Right.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Tomjon stood up, hit his head, sat down and then knelt on the floor as a compromise. He clasped his hands to what would have been, but for a few chance chromosomes, his bosom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">'You lie who call it Summer . .</em> .' he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The assembled dwarfs listened in silence for several minutes. One of them dropped his axe, and was noisily hushed by the rest of them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'. . . <em class="calibre10">and melting snow. Farewell,'</em> Tomjon finished. 'Drinks phial, collapses behind battlements, down ladder, out of dress and into tabard for Comic Guard No.2, wait one, entrance left. <em class="calibre10">What ho, good—'</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">'That's about enough,' said Hwel quietly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Several of the dwarfs were crying into their helmets. There was a chorus of blown noses.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Thundergust dabbed at his eyes with a chain-mail handkerchief.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'That was the most saddest thing I've ever heard,' he said. He glared at Tomjon. 'Hang on,' he said, as realisation dawned. 'He's a man. I bloody fell in love with that girl on stage.' He nudged Hwel. 'He's not a bit of an elf, is he?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Absolutely human,' said Hwel. 'I know his father.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Once again he stared hard at the Fool, who was watching them with his mouth open, and looked back at Tomjon.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nah, he thought. Coincidence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'S'acting,' he said. 'A good actor can be anything, right?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He could feel the Fool's eye boring into the back of his short neck.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Yes, but dressing up as women, it's a bit—' said Thundergust doubtfully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Tomjon slipped off his shoes and knelt down on them, bringing his face level with the dwarfs. He gave him a calculating stare for a few seconds, and then adjusted his features.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there were two Thundergusts. True, one of them was kneeling and had apparently been shaved.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'What ho, what ho,' said Tomjon in the dwarf's voice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This was by way of being a hilarious gag to the rest of the dwarfs, who had an uncomplicated sense of humour. As they gathered round the pair Hwel felt a gentle touch on the shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'You two are with a theatre?' said the Fool, now almost sober.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">'S'right.'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then I've come five hundred miles to find you.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was, as Hwel would have noted in his stage directions, Later the Same Day. The sounds of hammering as the Dysk theatre rose from its cradle of scaffolding thumped through Hwel's head and out the other side.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He could remember the drinking, he was certain. And the dwarfs bought lots more rounds when Tomjon did his impersonations. Then they had all gone to another bar Thundergust knew, and then they'd gone to a Klatchian takeaway, and after that it was just a blur . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wasn't very good at quaffing. Too much of the drink actually landed in his mouth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Judging by the taste in it, some incontinent creature of the night had also scored a direct hit.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can you do it?' said Vitoller.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel smacked his lips to get rid of the taste.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I expect,' said Tomjon. 'It sounded interesting, the way he told it. Wicked king ruling with the help of evil witches. Storms. Ghastly forests. True Heir to Throne in Life-and-Death Struggle. Flash of Dagger. Screams, alarums. Evil king dies. Good triumphs. Bells ring out.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Showers of rose petals could be arranged,' said Vitoller. 'I know a man who can get them at practically cost.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They both looked at Hwel, who was drumming his fingers on his stool. All three found their attention drawn to the bag of silver the Fool had given Hwel. Even by itself it represented enough money to complete the Dysk. And there had been talk of more to follow. Patronage, that was the thing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You'll do it then, will you?' said Vitoller.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's got a certain something,' Hwel conceded. </span>'But . . . I don't know . . .'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tm not trying to pressure you,' said Vitoller. All three pairs of eyes swivelled back to the money bag.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It seems a bit fishy,' Tomjon conceded. 'I mean, the Fool is decent enough. But the way he tells it . . . it's very odd. His mouth says the words, and his eyes say something else. And I got the impression he'd much rather we believed his eyes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'On the other hand,' said Vitoller hurriedly, 'what harm could it do? The pay's the thing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel raised his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' he said muzzily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, the play's the thing,' said Vitoller.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence again, except for the drumming of Hwel's fingertips. The bag of silver seemed to have grown larger. In fact, it seemed to fill the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The thing is—' Vitoller began, unnecessarily loudly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The way I see it—' Hwel began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They both stopped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'After you. Sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It wasn't important. Go ahead.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was going to say, we could afford to build the Dysk anyway,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just the shell and the stage,' said Vitoller. 'But not all the other things. Not the trapdoor mechanism, or the machine for lowering gods out of heaven. Or the big turntable, or the wind fans.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We used to manage without all that stuff,' said Hwel. 'Remember the old days? All we had was a few planks and a bit of painted sacking. But we had a lot of spirit. If we wanted wind we had to make it ourselves.' He drummed his fingers for a while. 'Of course,' he added quietly, 'we should be able to afford a wave machine. A small one. I've got this idea about this ship wrecked on an island, where there's this—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Sorry.' Vitoller shook his head. '</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we've had some huge audiences!' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sure, lad. Sure. But they pay in ha'pennies. The artificers want silver. If we wanted to be rich men – people,' he corrected hurriedly, 'we should have been born carpenters.' Vitoller shifted uneasily. 'I already owe Chrystophrase the Troll more than I should.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two stared.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's the one that has people's limbs torn off!' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How much do you owe him?' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's all right,' said Vitoller hurriedly, Tm keeping up the interest payments. More or less.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but how much does he want?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'An arm and a leg.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf and boy stared at him in horror. 'How could you have been so—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I did it for you two! Tomjon deserves a better stage, he doesn't want to go ruining his health sleeping in lattys and never knowing a home, and you, my man, you need somewhere settled, with all the proper things you ought to have, like trapdoors and . . . wave machines and so forth. You talked me into it, and I thought, they're right. It's no life out on the road, giving two performances a day to a bunch of farmers and going round with a hat afterwards, what sort of future is that? I thought, we've got to get a place somewhere, with comfortable seats for the gentry, people who don't throw potatoes at the stage. I said, blow the cost. I just wanted you to—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right, all right!' shouted Hwel. 'I'll write it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll act it,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm not forcing you, mind,' said Vitoller. 'It's your own choice.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel frowned at the table. There were, he had to admit, some nice touches. Three witches was good. Two wouldn't be enough, four would be too many. They could be meddling with the destinies of mankind, and everything. Lots of smoke and green light. You could do a lot with three witches. It was surprising no-one had thought of it before.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So we can tell this Fool that we'll do it, can we?' said Vitoller, his hand on the bag of silver.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And of course you couldn't go wrong with a good storm. And there was the ghost routine that Vitoller had cut out of <em class="calibre10">Please Yourself,</em> saying they couldn't afford the muslin. And perhaps he could put Death in, too. Young Dafe would make a damn good Death, with white makeup and platform soles . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How far away did he say he'd come from?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The Ramtops,' said the playmaster. 'Some little kingdom no-one has ever heard of. Sounds like a chest infection.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It'd take months to get there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'd like to go, anyway,' said Tomjon. 'That's where I was born.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller looked at the ceiling. Hwel looked at the floor. Anything was better, just at that moment, than looking at each other's face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's what you said,' said the boy. 'When you did a tour of the mountains, you said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but I can't remember where,' said Vitoller. 'All those little mountain towns looked the same to me. We spent more time pushing the lattys across rivers and dragging them up hills than we ever did on the stage.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I could take some of the younger lads and we could make a summer of it,' said Tomjon. 'Put on all the old favourites. And we could still be back by Soulcake Day. You could stay here and see to the theatre, and we could be back for a Grand Opening.' He grinned at his father. 'It'd be good for them,' he said slyly. 'You always said some of the young lads don't know what a real acting life is like.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hwel's still got to write the play,' Vitoller pointed out.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel was silent. He was staring at nothing at all. After a while one hand fumbled in his doublet and brought out a sheaf of paper, and then disappeared in the direction of his belt and produced a small corked ink pot and a bundle of quills.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They watched as, without once looking at them, the dwarf smoothed out the paper, opened the ink pot, dipped a quill, held it poised like a hawk waiting for its prey, and then began to write.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller nodded at Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Walking as quietly as they could, they left the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Around mid-afternoon they took up a tray of food and a bundle of paper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The tray was still there at teatime. The paper had gone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A few hours later a passing member of the company reported hearing a yell of 'It can't work! It's back to front!' and the sound of something being thrown across the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Around supper Vitoller heard a shouted request for more candles and fresh quills.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon tried to get an early night, but sleep was murdered by the sound of creativity from the next room. There were mutterings about balconies, and whether the world really needed wave machines. The rest was silence, except for the insistent scratching of quills.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Eventually, Tomjon dreamed.</span>

        <span>Tomjon awoke, shivering. The room was dark. Outside a few stars pierced the mists of the city, and there was the occasional whistle of burglars and footpads as they went about their strictly lawful occasions.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence from the next room, but he could see the light of a candle under the door.</span>

        <span>He went back to bed.</span>

        <span>Across the turgid river the Fool had also awakened. He was staying in the Fool's Guild, not out of choice but because the duke hadn't given him any money for anything else, and getting to sleep had been difficult in any case. The chilly walls had brought back too many memories. Besides, if he listened hard he could hear the muted sobs and occasional whimpers from the students' dormitories, as they contemplated with horror the life that lay ahead of them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He punched the rock-hard pillow, and sank into a fitful sleep. Perchance to dream.</span>

        <span>Tomjon wondered vaguely what divers alarums, which Hwel always included somewhere in the stage directions, actually were. Hwel always refused to say. Perhaps they referred to dangerous depths, or lack of air pressure.</span>

        <span>In his dreams gods rose and fell, ships moved with cunning and art across canvas oceans, pictures jumped and ran together and became flickering images; men flew on wires, flew without wires, great ships of illusion fought against one another in imaginary skies, seas opened, ladies were sawn in half, a thousand special effects men giggled and gibbered. Through it all he ran with his arms open in desperation, knowing that none of this really existed or ever would exist and all he <em class="calibre10">really</em> had was a few square yards of planking, some canvas and some paint on which to trap the beckoning images that invaded his head.</span>

        <span>They stood to one side and watched the dwarf artificers assembling the wave machine. It consisted of half a dozen long spindles, covered in complex canvas spirals painted in shades of blue and green and white, and stretching the complete width of the stage. An arrangement of cogs and endless belts led to a treadmill in the wings. When the spirals were all turning at once people with weak stomachs had to look away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sea battles,' breathed Hwel. 'Shipwrecks. Tritons. Pirates!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Squeaky bearings, laddie,' groaned Vitoller, shifting his weight on his stick. 'Maintenance expenses. Overtime.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It does look extremely . . . intricate,' Hwel admitted. 'Who designed it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A daft old chap in the Street of Cunning Artificers,' said Vitoller. 'Leonard of Quirm. He's a painter really. He just does this sort of thing for a hobby. I happened to hear that he's been working on this for months. I just snapped it up quick when he couldn't get it to fly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They watched the mock waves turn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're bent on going?' said Vitoller, at last.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes. Tomjon's still a bit wild. He needs an older head around the place.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll miss you, laddie. I don't mind telling you. You've been like a son to me. How old are you, exactly? I never did know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A hundred and two.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller nodded gloomily. He was sixty, and his arthritis was playing him up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've been like a father to me, then,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It evens out in the end,' said Hwel diffidently. 'Half the height, twice the age. You could say that on the overall average we live about the same length of time as humans.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The playmaster sighed. 'Well, I don't know what I will do without you and Tomjon around, and that's a fact.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's only for the summer, and a lot of the lads are staying. In fact it's mainly the apprentices that are going. You said yourself it'd be good experience.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller looked wretched and, in the chilly air of the half-finished theatre, a good deal smaller than usual, like a balloon two weeks after the party. He prodded some wood shavings distractedly with his stick.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We grow old, Master Hwel. At least,' he corrected himself, 'I grow old and you grow older. We have heard the gongs at midnight.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aye. You don't want him to go, do you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was all for it at first. You know. Then I thought, there's destiny afoot. Just when things are going well, there's always bloody destiny. I mean, that's where he came from.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Somewhere up in the mountains. Now fate is calling him back. I shan't see him again.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's only for the summer—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Vitoller held up a hand. 'Don't interrupt. I'd got the right dramatic flow there.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry.'</span>

        <span> went the stick on the wood shavings, knocking them into the air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean, you know he's not my flesh and blood.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's your son, though,' said Hwel. 'This hereditary business isn't all it's cracked up to be.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's fine of you to say that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I mean it. Look at me. I wasn't supposed to be writing plays. Dwarfs aren't even supposed to be able to <em class="calibre10">read. I</em> shouldn't worry too much about destiny, if I was you. I was destined to be a miner. Destiny gets it wrong half the time.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you said he looks like the Fool person. I can't see it myself, mark you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The light's got to be right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Could be some destiny at work there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel shrugged. Destiny was funny stuff, he knew. You couldn't trust it. Often you couldn't even see it. Just when you knew you had it cornered, it turned out to be something else – coincidence, maybe, or providence. You barred the door against it, and it was standing behind you. Then just when you thought you had it nailed down it walked away with the hammer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He used destiny a lot. As a tool for his plays it was even better than a ghost. There was nothing like a bit of destiny to get the old plot rolling. But it was a mistake to think you could spot the shape of it. And as for thinking it could be controlled ...</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax squinted irritably into Nanny Ogg's crystal ball. It wasn't a particularly good one, being a greenish glass fishing float brought back from forn seaside parts by one of her sons. It distorted everything including, she suspected, the truth.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's definitely on his way,' she said, at last. 'In a cart.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A fiery white charger would have been favourite,' said Nanny Ogg. 'You know. Caparisoned, and that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Has he got a magic sword?' said Magrat, craning to see.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax sat back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're a disgrace, the pair of you,' she said. 'I don't know – magic chargers, fiery swords. Ogling away like a couple of milkmaids.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A magic sword is important,' said Magrat. 'You've got to have one. We could make him one,' she added wistfully. 'Out of thunderbolt iron. I've got a spell for that. You take some thunderbolt iron,' she said uncertainly, 'and then you make a sword out of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I can't be having with that old stuff,' said Granny. 'You can wait days for the damn things to hit and then they nearly take your arm off.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And a strawberry birthmark,' said Nanny Ogg, ignoring the interruption.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two looked at her expectantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A strawberry birthmark,' she repeated. 'It's one of those things you've got to have if you're a prince coming to claim your kingdom. That's so's everyone will know. O'course, I don't know how they know it's <em class="calibre10">strawberry.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can't abide strawberries,' said Granny vaguely, quizzing the crystal again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In its cracked green depths, smelling of bygone lobsters, a minute Tomjon kissed his parents, shook hands or hugged the rest of the company, and climbed aboard the leading latty.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It must of worked, she told herself. Else he wouldn't be coming here, would he? All those others must be his trusty band of good companions. After all, common sense, he's got to come five hundred miles across difficult country, anything could happen.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I daresay the armour and swords is in the carts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She detected a twinge of doubt, and set out to quell it instantly. There isn't any other reason for him to come, stands to reason. We got the spell exactly right. Except for the ingredients. And most of the poetry. And it probably wasn't the right time. And Gytha took most of it home for the cat, which couldn't of been proper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But he's on his way. What can't speak, can't lie.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Best put the cloth over it when you've done, Esme,' said Nanny. 'I always get worried someone'll peer in at me when I'm having my bath.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's on his way,' said Granny, the satisfaction in her voice so strong you could have ground corn with it. She dropped the black velvet bag over the ball.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a long road,' said Nanny. 'There's many a slip twixt dress and drawers. There could be bandits.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We shall watch over him,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's not right. If he's going to be king he ought to be able to fight his own battles,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We don't want him to go wasting his strength,' said Nanny primly. 'We want him good and fresh for when he gets here.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And then, I hope, we shall leave him to fight his battles in his own way,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny clapped her hands together in a businesslike fashion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Quite right,' she said. 'Provided he looks like winning.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They had been meeting at Nanny Ogg's cottage. Magrat made an excuse to tarry after Granny left, around dawn, allegedly to help Nanny with tidying up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whatever happened to not meddling?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What do you mean?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You know, Nanny.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not proper meddling,' said Nanny awkwardly. 'Just helping matters along.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Surely you can't really think that!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny sat down and fidgeted with a cushion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, see, all this not meddling business is fine in the normal course of things,' she said. 'Not meddling is easy when you don't have to. And then I've got the family to think about. Our Jason's been in a couple of fights because of what people have been saying. Our Shawn was thrown out of the army. The way I see it, when we get the new king in, he should owe us a few favours. It's only fair.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But only last week you were saying—' Magrat stopped, shocked at this display of pragmatism.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A week is a long time in magic,' said Nanny. 'Fifteen years, for one thing. Anyway, Esme is determined and I'm in no mood to stop her.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So what you're saying,' said Magrat, icily, 'is that this "not meddling" thing is like taking a vow not to swim. You'll absolutely never break it unless of course you happen to find yourself in the water?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Better than drowning,' Nanny said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She reached up to the mantelpiece and took down a clay pipe that was like a small tar pit. She lit it with a spill from the remains of the fire, while Greebo watched her carefully from his cushion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat idly lifted the hood from the ball and glared at it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' she said, 'that I will never really understand about witchcraft. Just when I think I've got a grip on it, it changes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'We're all just people.' Nanny blew a cloud of blue smoke at the chimney. <span>'Everyone's just people.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can I borrow the crystal?' said Magrat suddenly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Feel free,' said Nanny. She grinned at Magrat's back. 'Had a row with your young man?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I really don't know what you're talking about.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Haven't seen him around for weeks.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, the duke sent him to—' Magrat stopped, and went on – 'sent him away for something or other. Not that it bothers me at all, either way.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So I see. Take the ball, by all means.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat was glad to get back home. No-one was about on the moors at night anyway, but over the last couple of months things had definitely been getting worse. On top of the general suspicion of witches, it was dawning on the few people in Lancre who had any dealings with the outside world that a) either more things had been happening than they had heard about before or b) time was out of joint. It wasn't easy to prove<a href="#note_19" title="Because of the way time was recorded among the various states, kingdoms and cities. After all, when over an area of a hundred square miles the same year is variously the Year of the Small Bat, and Anticipated Monkey, the Hunting Cloud, Fat Cows, Three Bright Stallions and at least nine numbers recording the time since* assorted kings, prophets, and strange events were either crowned, born or happened, and each year has a different number of months, and some of them don't have weeks, and one of them refuses to accept the day as a measure of time, the only thing it is possible to be sure of is that good sex doesn't last long enough.†"><sup class="calibre11">[19]</sup></a></span>
        <span>, but the few traders who came along the mountain tracks after the winter seemed to be rather older than they should have been. Unexplained happenings were always more or less expected in the Ramtops because of the high magical potential, but several years disappearing overnight was a bit of a first.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She locked the door, fastened the shutters, and carefully laid the green glass globe on the kitchen table.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She concentrated . . .</span>

        <span>The Fool dozed under the tarpaulins of the river barge, heading up the Ankh at a steady two miles an hour. It wasn't an exciting method of transport but it got you there eventually.</span>

        <span>He looked safe enough, but he was tossing and turning in his sleep.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat wondered what it was like, spending your whole life doing something you didn't want to do. Like being dead, she considered, only worse, the reason being, you were alive to suffer it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She considered the Fool to be weak, badly led and sorely in need of some backbone. And she was longing for him to get back, so she could look forward to never seeing him again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a long, hot summer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They didn't rush things. There was a lot of country between Ankh-Morpork and the Ramtops. It was, Hwel had to admit, fun. It wasn't a word dwarfs were generally at home with.</span>

          <span>Please Yourself</span>

        <span> went over well. It always did. The apprentices excelled themselves. They forgot lines, and played jokes; in Sto Lat the whole third act of <em class="calibre10">Gretalina and Mellias</em> was performed against the backdrop for the second act of <em class="calibre10">The Mage Wars,</em> but no-one seemed to notice that the greatest love scene in history was played on a set depicting a tidal wave sweeping across a continent. That was possibly because Tomjon was playing Gretalina. The effect was so disconcertingly riveting that Hwel made him swap roles for the next house, if you could apply the term to a barn hired for the day, and the effect still had more rivets than a suit of plate armour, including the helmet, and even though Gretalina in this case was now young Wimsloe, who was a bit simple and tended to stutter and whose spots might eventually clear up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The following day, in some nameless village in the middle of an endless sea of cabbages, he let Tomjon play Old Miskin in <em class="calibre10">Please Yourself,</em> a role that Vitoller always excelled in. You couldn't let anyone play it who was under the age of forty, not unless you wanted an Old Miskin with a cushion up his jerkin and greasepaint wrinkles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel didn't consider himself old. His father had still been digging three tons of ore a day at the age of two hundred.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>Now</span>
        </em>
        <span> he felt old. He watched Tomjon hobble off the stage, and for a fleeting instant knew what it was to be a fat old man, pickled in wine, fighting old wars that no-one cared about any more, hanging grimly on to the precipice of late middle-age for fear of dropping off into antiquity, but only with one hand, because with the other he was raising two fingers at Death. Of course, he'd known that when he wrote the part. But he hadn't <em class="calibre10">known</em> it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The same magic didn't seem to infuse the new play. They tried it a few times, just to see how it went. The audience watched attentively, and went home. They didn't even bother to throw anything. It wasn't that they thought it was bad. They didn't think it was anything.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But all the right ingredients were there, weren't they? Tradition was full of people giving evil rulers a well-justified seeing to. Witches were always a draw. The apparition of Death was particularly good, with some lovely lines. Mix them all together . . . and they seemed to cancel out, become a mere humdrum way of filling the stage for a couple of hours.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Late at night, when the cast was alseep, Hwel would sit up in one of the carts and feverishly rewrite. He rearranged scenes, cut lines, <em class="calibre10">added</em> lines, introduced a clown, included another fight, and tuned up the special effects. It didn't seem to have any effect. The play was like some marvellous intricate painting, a feast of impressions close to, a mere blur from the distance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When the inspirations were sleeting fast he even tried changing the style. In the morning the early risers grew accustomed to finding discarded experiments decorating the grass around the carts, like extremely literate mushrooms.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon kept one of the strangest: </span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' said Tomjon, later, 'you ought to slow down a bit. You've done what was ordered. No-one said it had to <em class="calibre10">sparkle.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It could, you know. If I could just get it right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're absolutely sure about the ghost, are you?' said Tomjon. The way he threw the line away made it clear that he wasn't.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's nothing wrong with the ghost,' snapped Hwel. 'The scene with the ghost is the best I've done.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was just wondering if this is the right play for it, that's all.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The ghost stays. Now let's get on, boy.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Two days later, with the Ramtops a blue and white wall that was beginning to dominate the Hubward horizon, the company was attacked. There wasn't much drama; they had just manhandled the lattys across a ford and were resting in the shade of a grove of trees, which suddenly fruited robbers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked along the line of half a dozen stained and rusty blades. Their owners seemed slightly uncertain about what to do next.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We've got a receipt somewhere—' he began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nudged him. 'These don't look like Guild thieves,' he hissed. 'They definitely look freelance to me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It would be nice to say that the leader of the robbers was a black-bearded, swaggering brute, with a red headscarf and one gold earring and a chin you could clean pots with. Actually it would be practically compulsory. And, in fact, this was so. Hwel thought the wooden leg was overdoing it, but the man had obviously studied the role.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well now,' said the bandit chief. 'What have we here, and do they have any money?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're actors,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That ought to answer both questions,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And none of your repartee,' said the bandit. 'I've been to the city, I have. I know repartee when I see it and—' he half turned to his followers, raising an eyebrow to indicate that the next remark was going to be witty – 'if you're not careful I can make a few <em class="calibre10">cutting</em> remarks of my own.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was dead silence behind him until he made an impatient gesture with his cutlass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' he said, against a chorus of uncertain laughter. 'We'll just take any loose change, valuables, food and clothing you might be having.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Could I say something?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The company backed away from him. Hwel smiled at his own feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're going to beg for mercy, are you?' said the bandit.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel thrust his hands deep into his pockets and looked up at the sky, whistling under his breath and trying not to break into a maniac grin. He was aware that the other actors were also looking expectantly at Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He's going to give them the mercy speech from <em class="calibre10">The Troll's Tale,</em> he thought . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The point I'd just like to make is that—' said Tomjon, and his stance changed subtly, his voice became deeper, his right hand flung out dramatically – ' "The worth of man lies not in feats of arms, Or the fiery hunger o' the ravening—" '</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It's going to be like when that man tried to rob us back in Sto Lat, Hwel thought. If they end up giving us their swords, what the hell can we do with them? And it's so embarrassing when they start crying.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was at this moment that the world around him took a green tint and he thought he could make out, right on the cusp of hearing, other voices.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'There's men with swords, Granny!'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—rend with glowing blades the marvel of the world—' Tomjon said, and the voices at the edge of imagination said. <em class="calibre10">'No king of</em> mine <em class="calibre10">is going to beg anything off anyone. Give me that milk jug, Magrat.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—the heart of compassion, the kiss—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'That was a present from my aunt.'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—this jewel of jewels, this crown of crowns.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence. One or two of the bandits were weeping silently into their hands.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Their chief said, 'Is that it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>For the first time in his life Tomjon looked nonplussed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, yes,' he said. 'Er. Would you like me to repeat it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was a good speech,' the bandit conceded. 'But I don't see what it's got to do with me. I'm a practical man. Hand over your valuables.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His sword came up until it was level with Tomjon's throat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And all the rest of you shouldn't be standing there like idiots,' he added. 'Come on. Or the boy gets it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe the apprentice raised a cautious hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said the bandit.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A-are you s-sure you listened carefully, sir?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I won't tell you again! Either I hear the clink of coins, or you hear a gurgle!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In fact what they all heard was a whistling noise, high in the air, and the crash as a milk jug, its sides frosted with the ice of altitude, dropped out of the sky on to the spike atop the chief's helmet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The remaining bandits took one look at the results, and fled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The actors stared down at the recumbent bandit. Hwel prodded a lump of frozen milk with his boot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, well,' he said weakly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He didn't take any notice!' whispered Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A born critic,' said the dwarf. It was a blue and white jug. Funny how little details stood out at a time like this. It had been smashed several times in the past, he could see, because the pieces had been carefully glued together again. Someone had really loved that jug.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What we're dealing with here,' he said, rallying some shreds of logic, 'is a freak whirlwind. Obviously.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But milk jugs don't just drop out of the sky,' said Tomjon, demonstrating the astonishing human art of denying the obvious.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know about that. I've heard of fish and frogs and rocks,' said Hwel. </span>'There's nothing against crockery.' He began to rally. <span>'It's just one of these uncommon phenomenons.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They happen all the time in this part of the world, there's nothing unusual about it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They got back on to the carts and rode on in unaccustomed silence. Young Wimsloe collected every bit of jug he could find and stored them carefully in the props box, and spent the rest of the day watching the sky, hoping for a sugar basin.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The lattys toiled up the dusty slopes of the Ramtops, mere motes in the foggy glass of the crystal.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are they all right?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They're wandering all over the place,' said Granny. 'They may be good at the acting, but they've got something to learn about the travelling.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was a nice jug,' said Magrat. 'You can't get them like that any more. I mean, if you'd have said what was on your mind, there was a flatiron on the shelf.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's more to life than milk jugs.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It had a daisy pattern round the top.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny ignored her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' she said, 'it's time we had a look at this new king. </span>Close up.' She cackled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You cackled, Granny,' said Magrat darkly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I did not! It was,' Granny fumbled for a word, 'a chuckle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I bet Black Aliss used to cackle.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You want to watch out you don't end up the same way as she did,' said Nanny, from her seat by the fire. 'She went a bit funny at the finish, you know. Poisoned apples and suchlike.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just because I might have chuckled a . . . a bit roughly,' sniffed Granny. She felt that she was being unduly defensive. 'Anyway, there's nothing wrong with cackling. In moderation.'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think,' said Tomjon, 'that we're lost.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked at the baking purple moorland around them, which stretched up to the towering spires of the Ramtops themselves. Even in the height of summer there were pennants of snow flying from the highest peaks. It was a landscape of describable beauty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Bees were busy, or at least endeavouring to look and sound busy, in the thyme by the trackside. Cloud shadows flickered over the alpine meadows. There was the kind of big, empty silence made by an environment that not only doesn't have any people in it, but doesn't need them either.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Or signposts.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We were lost ten miles ago,' said Hwel. 'There's got to be a new word for what we are now.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You said the mountains were honeycombed with dwarf mines,' said Tomjon. 'You said a dwarf could tell wherever he was in the mountains.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Underground,</span>
        </em>
        <span> I said. It's all a matter of strata and rock formations. Not on the surface. All the landscape gets in the way.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We could dig you a hole,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But it was a nice day and, as the road meandered through clumps of hemlock and pine, outposts of the forest, it was pleasant enough to let the mules go at their own pace. The road, Hwel felt, had to go somewhere.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This geographical fiction has been the death of many people. Roads don't necessarily have to go anywhere, they just have to have somewhere to start.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We <em class="calibre10">are</em> lost, aren't we?' said Tomjon, after a while.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly not.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Where are we, then?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The mountains. Perfectly clear on any atlas.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ought to stop and ask someone.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon gazed around at the rolling countryside. Somewhere a lonely curlew howled, or possibly it was a badger – Hwel was a little hazy about rural matters, at least those that took place higher than about the limestone layer. There wasn't another human being within miles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who did you have in mind?' he said sarcastically.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That old woman in the funny hat,' said Tomjon, pointing. 'I've been watching her. She keeps ducking down behind a bush when she thinks I've seen her.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel turned and looked down at a bramble bush, which wobbled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ho there, good mother,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The bush sprouted an indignant head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whose mother?' it said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel hesitated. 'Just a figure of speech, Mrs . . . Miss . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Mistress,' snapped Granny Weatherwax. 'And I'm a poor old woman gathering wood,' she added defiantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She cleared her throat. 'Lawks,' she went on. 'You did give me a fright, young master. My poor old heart.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was silence from the carts. Then Tomjon said, 'I'm sorry?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your poor old heart what?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What about my poor old heart?' said Granny, who wasn't used to acting like an old woman and had a very limited repertoire in this area. But it's traditional that young heirs seeking their destiny get help from mysterious old women gathering wood, and she wasn't about to buck tradition.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's just that you mentioned it,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, it isn't important. Lawks. I expect you're looking for Lancre,' said Granny testily, in a hurry to get to the point.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, yes,' said Tomjon. 'All day.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've come too far,' said Granny. 'Go back about two miles, and take the track on the right, past the stand of pines.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe tugged at Tomjon's shirt.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When you m-meet a m-mysterious old lady in the road,' he said, 'you've got to offer to s-share your lunch. Or help her across the r-river.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You have?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's t-terribly b-bad luck not to.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon gave Granny a polite smile.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Would you care to share our lunch, good mo – old wo – ma'am?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny looked doubtful.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What is it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Salt pork.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She shook her head. 'Thanks all the same,' she said graciously. 'But it gives me wind.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned on her heel and set off through the bushes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We could help you across the river if you like,' shouted Tomjon after her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What river?' said Hwel. 'We're on the moor, there can't be a river in miles.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Y-you've got to get them on y-your side,' said Wimsloe. 'Then t-they help you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Perhaps we should have asked her to wait while we went and looked for one,' said Hwel sourly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They found the turning. It led into a forest criss-crossed with as many tracks as a marshalling yard, the sort of forest where the back of your head tells you the trees are turning around to watch you as you go past and the sky seems to be very high up and a long way off. Despite the heat of the day a dank, impenetrable gloom hovered among the tree trunks, which crowded up to the track as if intending to obliterate it completely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They were soon lost again, and decided that being lost somewhere where you didn't know where you were was even worse than being lost in the open.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She could have given more explicit instructions,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Like ask at the next crone,' said Tomjon. 'Look over there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stood up in the seat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ho there, old . . . good . . .' he hazarded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat pushed back her shawl.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just a humble wood gatherer,' she snapped. She held up a twig for proof. Several hours waiting with nothing but trees to talk to hadn't improved her temper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe nudged Tomjon, who nodded and fixed his face in an ingratiating smile.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Would you care to share our lunch, old . . . good wo . . . miss?' he said. 'It's only salt pork, I'm afraid.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Meat is extremely bad for the digestive system,' said Magrat. 'If you could see inside your colon you'd be horrified.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think I would,' muttered Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you know that an adult male carries up to five pounds of undigested red meat in his intestines at all times?' said Magrat, whose informative lectures on nutrition had been known to cause whole families to hide in the cellar until she went away. 'Whereas pine kernels and sunflower seeds—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There aren't any rivers around that you need helping over, are there?' said Tomjon desperately.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't be silly,' said Magrat. 'I'm just a humble wood gatherer, lawks, collecting a few sticks and mayhap directing lost travellers on the road to Lancre.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said Hwel, 'I thought we'd get to that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You fork left up ahead and turn right at the big stone with the crack in it, you can't miss it,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fine,' growled Hwel. 'Well, we won't keep you. I'm sure you've got a lot of wood to collect and so forth.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He whistled the mules into a plod again, grumbling to himself.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When, an hour later, the track ran out among a landscape of house-sized boulders, Hwel laid down the reins carefully and folded his arms. Tomjon stared at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What do you think you're doing?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Waiting,' said the dwarf grimly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It'll be getting dark soon.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We won't be here long,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Eventually Nanny Ogg gave up and came out from behind her rock.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's salt pork, understand?' said Hwel sharply. 'Take it or leave it, okay? Now – which way's Lancre?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Keep on, left at the ravine, then you pick up the track that leads to a bridge, you can't miss it,' said Nanny promptly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel grabbed the reins. 'You forgot about the lawks.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bugger. Sorry. Lawks.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you're a humble old wood gatherer, I expect,' Hwel went on.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Spot on, lad,' said Nanny cheerfully. 'Just about to make a start, as a matter of fact.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nudged the dwarf.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You forgot about the river,' he said. Hwel glared at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh yes,' he muttered, 'and can you wait here while we go and find a river.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'To help you across,' said Tomjon carefully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg gave him a bright smile. 'There's a perfectly good bridge,' she said. 'But I wouldn't say no to a lift. Move over.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>To Hwel's irritation Nanny Ogg hitched up her skirts and scrambled on to the board, inserting herself between Tomjon and the dwarf and then twisting like an oyster knife until she occupied half the seat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You mentioned salt pork,' she said. 'There wouldn't be any mustard, would there?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' said Hwel sullenly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can't abide salt pork without condiments,' said Nanny conversationally. </span>'But pass it over, anyway.' Wimsloe wordlessly handed over the basket holding the troupe's supper. <span>Nanny lifted the lid and gave it a critical assessment.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That cheese in there is a bit off,' she said. 'It needs eating up quick. What's in the leather bottle?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Beer,' said Tomjon, a fraction of a second before Hwel had the presence of mind to say, 'Water.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pretty weak stuff,' said Nanny, eventually. She fumbled in her apron pocket for her tobacco pouch.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Has anyone got a light?' she inquired.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A couple of actors produced bundles of matches. Nanny nodded, and put the pouch away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good,' she said. 'Now, has anyone got any tobacco?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Half an hour later the lattys rattled over the Lancre Bridge, across some of the outlying farmlands, and through the forests that made up most of the kingdom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is it?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, not all of it,' said Nanny, who had been expecting rather more enthusiasm. 'There's lots more of it behind the mountains over there. But this is the flat bit.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You call this flat?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Flattish,' Nanny conceded. 'But the air's good. That's the palace up there, offering outstanding views of the surrounding countryside.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You mean forests.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You'll like it here,' said Nanny encouragingly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a bit small.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny thought about this. She'd spent nearly all her life inside the boundaries of Lancre. It had always seemed about the right size to her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bijou,' she said. 'Handy for everywhere.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Everywhere <em class="calibre10">where?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny gave up. 'Everywhere close,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel said nothing. The air <em class="calibre10">was</em> good, rolling down the unclimbable slopes of the Ramtops like a sinus wash, tinted with turpentine from the high forests. They passed through a gateway into what was, up here, probably called a town; the cosmopolitan he had become decided that, down on the plains, it would just about have qualified, as an open space.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's an inn,' said Tomjon doubtfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel followed his gaze. 'Yes,' he said, eventually. 'Yes, it probably is.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When are we going to do the play?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know. I think we just send up to the castle and say we're here.' Hwel scratched his chin. 'Fool said the king or whoever would want to see the script.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon looked around Lancre town. It seemed peaceful enough. It didn't look like the kind of place likely to turn actors out at nightfall. It needed the population.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is the capital city of the kingdom,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Well-designed streets, you'll notice.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Streets?' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Street,' corrected Granny. 'Also houses in quite good repair, stone's throw from river—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Throw?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Drop,' Nanny conceded. 'Neat middens, look, and extensive—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Madam, we've come to entertain the town, not buy it,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg looked sidelong at Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just wanted you to see how attractive it is,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Your civic pride does you credit,' said Hwel. 'And now, please, leave the cart. I'm sure you've got some wood to gather. Lawks.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Much obliged for the snack,' said Nanny, climbing down.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Meals,' corrected Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon nudged him. 'You ought to be more polite,' he said. </span>'You never know.' He turned to Nanny. <span>'Thank you, good – oh, she's gone.'</span></div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They've come to do a theatre,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax carried on shelling beans in the sun, much to Nanny's annoyance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well? Aren't you going to say something? I've been finding out things,' she said. 'Picking up information. Not sitting around making soup—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Stew.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I reckon it's very important,' sniffed Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What kind of a theatre?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They didn't say. Something for the duke, I think.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's he want a theatre for?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They didn't say that, either.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's probably all a trick to get in the castle,' Granny said knowingly. 'Very clever idea. Did you see anything in the carts?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Boxes and bundles and such.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They'll be full of armour and weapons, depend upon it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg looked doubtful.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They didn't look very much like soldiers to me. They were awfully young and spotty.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Clever. I expect in the middle of the play the king will manifest his destiny, right where everyone can see him. Good plan.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's another thing,' said Nanny, picking up a bean pod and chewing it. 'He doesn't seem to like the place much.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course he does. It's in his blood.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I brought him the pretty way. He didn't seem very impressed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny hesitated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He was probably suspicious of you,' she concluded. 'He was probably too overcome to speak, really.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She put down the bowl of beans and looked thoughtfully at the trees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Have you got any family still working up at the castle?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shirl and Daff help out in the kitchens since the cook went off his head.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good. I'll have a word with Magrat. I think we should see this theatre.'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Perfect,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Thank you,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've got it exactly spot on about that dreadful accident,' said the duke. 'You might almost have been there. Ha. Ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You weren't, were you?' said Lady Felmet, leaning forward and glaring at the dwarf.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I just used my imagination,' said Hwel hurriedly. The duchess glared at him, suggesting that his imagination could consider itself lucky it wasn't being dragged off to the courtyard to explain itself to four angry wild horses and a length of chain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Exactly right,' said the duke, leafing one-handedly through the pages. 'This is exactly, exactly, exactly how it was.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Will have been,'</span>
        </em>
        <span> snapped the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke turned another page.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're in this too,' he said. 'Amazing. It's a word for word how I'm going to remember it. I see you've got Death in it, too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Always popular,' said Hwel. 'People expect it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How soon can you act it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Stage it,' corrected Hwel, and added, 'We've tried it out. As soon as you like.' And then we can get away from here, he said to himself, away from your eyes like two raw eggs and this female mountain in the red dress and this castle which seems to act like a magnet for the wind. This is not going to go down as one of my best plays, I know that much.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How much did we say we were going to pay you?' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think you mentioned another hundred silver pieces,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Worth every penny,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel left hurriedly, before the duchess could start to bargain. But he felt he'd gladly pay something to be out of this place. Bijou, he thought. Gods, how could anyone like a kingdom like this?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool waited in the meadow with the lake. He stared wistfully at the sky and wondered where the hell Magrat was. This was, she said, <em class="calibre10">their</em> place; the fact that a few dozen cows also shared it at the moment didn't appear to make any difference.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She turned up in a green dress and a filthy temper.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's all this about a play?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool sagged on to a willow log.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aren't you glad to see me?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, yes. Of course. Now, this play . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My lord wants something to convince people that he is the rightful King of Lancre. Himself mostly, I think.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is that why you went to the city?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's disgusting!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool sat calmly. 'You would prefer the duchess's approach?' he said. 'She just thinks they ought to kill everyone. She's good at that sort of thing. And then there'd be fighting, and everything. Lots of people would die anyway. This way might be easier.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, where's your spunk, man?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Pardon?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't you want to die nobly for a just cause?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'd much rather live quietly for one. It's all right for you witches, you can do what you like, but I'm circumscribed,' said the Fool.</span>

        <span>Magrat sat down beside him. <em class="calibre10">Find out all about this play,</em> Granny had ordered. <em class="calibre10">Go and talk to that jingling friend of yours.</em> She'd replied, <em class="calibre10">He's very loyal. He might not tell me anything.</em> And Granny had said, <em class="calibre10">This is no time for half measures. If you have to, seduct him.</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When's this play going to be, then?' she said, moving closer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Marry, I'm sure I'm not allowed to tell you,' said the Fool. 'The duke said to me, he said, don't tell the witches that it's tomorrow night.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I shouldn't, then,' agreed Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'At eight o'clock.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I see.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But meet for sherry beforehand at seven-thirty, i'faith.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I expect you shouldn't tell me who <em class="calibre10">is</em> invited, either,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right. Most of the dignitaries of Lancre. You understand I'm not telling you this.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right,' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I think you have a right to know what it is you're not being told.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good point. Is there still that little gate around the back, that leads to the kitchens?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The one that is often left unguarded?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, we hardly ever guard it these days.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you think there might be someone guarding it at around eight o'clock tomorrow?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, <em class="calibre10">I</em> might be there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Good.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool pushed away the wet nose of an inquisitive cow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The duke will be expecting you,' he added.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You said he said we weren't to know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He said I mustn't tell you. But he also said, "They'll come anyway, I hope they do." Strange, really. He seemed in a very good mood when he said it. Um. Can I see you after the show?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is that all he said?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, there was something about showing witches their future. I didn't understand it. I really would like to see you after the show, you know. I brought—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think I might be washing my hair,' said Magrat vaguely. 'Excuse me, I really ought to be going.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but I brought you this pres—' said the Fool vaguely, watching her departing figure.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He sagged as she disappeared between the trees, and looked down at the necklace wound tightly between his nervous fingers. It was, he had to admit, terribly tasteless, but it was the sort of thing she liked, all silver and skulls. It had cost him too much.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A cow, misled by his horns, stuck its tongue in his ear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was true, the Fool thought. Witches <em class="calibre10">did</em> do unpleasant things to people, sometimes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomorrow night came, and the witches went by a roundabout route to the castle, with considerable reluctance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'If he wants us to be here, I don't want to go,' said Granny. 'He's got some plan. He's using headology on us.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's something up,' said Magrat. 'He had his men set fire to three cottages in our village last night. He always does that when he's in a good mood. That new sergeant is a quick man with the matches, too.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Our Daff said she saw them actors practisin' this morning,' said Nanny Ogg, who was carrying a bag'of walnuts and a leather bottle from which rose a rich, sharp smell. 'She said it was all shouting and stabbing and then wondering who done it and long bits with people muttering to themselves in loud voices.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Actors,' said Granny, witheringly. 'As if the world weren't full of enough history without inventing more.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They shout so loud, too,' said Nanny. 'You can hardly hear yourself talk.' She was also carrying, deep in her apron pocket, a lump of haunted castle rock. The king was getting in free.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny nodded. But, she thought, it was going to be worth it. She hadn't got the faintest idea what Tomjon had in mind, but her inbuilt sense of drama assured her that the boy would be bound to do something important. She wondered if he would leap off the stage and stab the duke to death, and realised that she was hoping like hell that he would.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All hail wossname,' she said under her breath, 'who shall be king here, after.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Let's get a move on,' said Nanny. 'All the sherry'll be gone.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool was waiting despondently inside the little wicket gate. His face brightened when he saw Magrat, and then froze in an expression of polite surprise when he saw the other two.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's not going to be any trouble, is there?' he said. 'I don't want there to be any trouble. Please.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm sure I don't know what you mean,' said Granny regally, sweeping past.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wotcha, jinglebells,' said Nanny, elbowing the man in the ribs. 'I hope you haven't been keeping our girl here up late o'nights!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nanny!' said Magrat, shocked. The Fool gave the terrified, ingratiating rictus of young men everywhere when confronted by importunate elderly women commenting on their intimately personal lives.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The older witches brushed past. The Fool grabbed Magrat's hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know where we can get a good view,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She hesitated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's all right,' said the Fool urgently. 'You'll be perfectly safe with me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, I will, won't I,' said Magrat, trying to look around him to see where the others had gone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They're staging the play outside, in the big courtyard. We'll get a lovely view from one of the gate towers, and no-one else will be there. I put some wine up there for us, and everything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When she still looked half-reluctant he added, 'And there's a cistern of water and a fireplace that the guards use sometimes. In case you want to wash your hair.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The castle was full of people standing around in that polite, sheepish way affected by people who see each other all day and are now seeing each other again in unusual social circumstances, like an office party. The witches passed quite unremarked among them and found seats in the rows of benches in the main courtyard, set up before a hastily assembled stage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg waved her bag of walnuts at Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Want one?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>An alderman of Lancre shuffled past her and pointed politely to the seat on her left.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is anyone sitting here?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The alderman looked distractedly at the rest of the benches, which were filling up fast, and then down at the clearly empty space in front of him. He hitched up his robes with a determined expression.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think that since the play is commencing to start, your friends must find a seat elsewhere, when they arrive,' he said, and sat down.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Within seconds his face went white. His teeth began to chatter. He clutched at his stomach and groaned<a href="#note_20" title="The observant will realise that this was because the king was already seated there. It was not because the man had used the phrase 'commence to start' in cold blood. But it ought to have been."><sup class="calibre11">[20]</sup></a>.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">told</em> you,' said Nanny, as he lurched away. 'What's the good of asking if you're not going to listen?' She leaned towards the empty seat. 'Walnut?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, thank you,' said King Verence, waving a spectral hand. 'They go right through me, you know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'Pray, gentles all, list to our tale ...'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's this?' hissed Granny. 'Who's the fellow in the tights?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He's the Prologue,' said Nanny. 'You have to have him at the beginning so everyone knows what the play's about.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can't understand a word of it,' muttered Granny. 'What's a gentle, anyway?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Type of maggot,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's nice, isn't it? "Hallo maggots, welcome to the show." Puts people in a nice frame of mind, doesn't it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a chorus of 'sshs'.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'These walnuts are damn tough,' said Nanny, spitting one out into her hand. 'I'm going to have to take my shoe off to this one.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny subsided into unaccustomed, troubled silence, and tried to listen to the prologue. The theatre worried her. It had a magic of its own, one that didn't belong to her, one that wasn't in her control. It changed the world, and said things were otherwise than they were. And it was worse than that. It was magic that didn't belong to magical people. It was commanded by ordinary people, who didn't know the rules. They altered the world because it sounded better.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke and duchess were sitting on their thrones right in front of the stage. As Granny glared at them the duke half turned, and she saw his smile.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I want the world the way it is, she thought. I want the past the way it was. The past used to be a lot better than it is now.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And the band struck up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel peered around a pillar and signalled to Wimsloe and Brattsley, who hobbled out into the glare of the torches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>OLD MAN</span>
        </span>
        <span> (an Elder): <em class="calibre10">'What hath befell the land?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

          <span>OLD WOMAN</span>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf watched them for a few seconds from the wings, his lips moving soundlessly. Then he scuttled back to the guardroom where the rest of the cast were still in the last hasty stages of dressing. He uttered the stage manager's traditional scream of rage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'C'mon,' he ordered. 'Soldiers of the king, at the double! And the witches – <em class="calibre10">where are the blasted witches?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Three junior apprentices presented themselves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I've lost my wart!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The cauldron's all full of yuk!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's something living in this wig!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Calm down, calm down,' screamed Hwel. 'It'll all be all right on the night!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is the night, Hwel!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel snatched a handful of putty from the makeup table and slammed on a wart like an orange. The offending straw wig was rammed on its owner's head, livestock and all. and the cauldron was very briefly inspected and pronounced full of just the right sort of yuk, nothing wrong with yuk like that.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On stage a guard dropped his shield, bent down to pick it up, and dropped his spear. Hwel rolled his eyes and offered up a silent prayer to any gods that might be watching.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was already going wrong. The earlier rehearsals had their little teething troubles, it was true, but Hwel had known one or two monumental horrors in his time and this one was shaping up to be the worst. The company was more jittery than a potful of lobsters. Out of the corner of his ear he heard the on-stage dialogue falter, and scurried to the wings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—avenge the terror of thy father's death—' he hissed, and hurried back to the trembling witches. He groaned. Divers alarums. This lot were supposed to be terrorising a kingdom. He had about a minute before the cue.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right!' he said, pulling himself together. 'Now, what are you? You're evil hags, right?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, Hwel,' they said meekly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Tell me what you are,' he commanded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're evil hags, Hwel.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Louder!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're Evil Hags!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel stalked the length of the quaking line, then turned abruptly on his heel, 'And what are you going to do?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The 2nd Witche scratched his crawling wig.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're going to curse people?' he ventured. 'It says in the script—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I-can't-HEAR-you!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're going to curse people!' they chorused, springing to attention and staring straight ahead to avoid his gaze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel stumped back along the line.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're hags, Hwel!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What kind of hags?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're black and midnight hags!' they yelled, getting into the spirit.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What kind of black and midnight hags?'</span>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel drew himself to his full height, such as it was.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What-are-you?' he screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're scheming evil secret black and midnight hags!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right!' He pointed a vibrating finger towards the stage and lowered his voice and, at that moment, a dramatic inspiration dived through the atmosphere and slammed into his creative node, causing him to say, 'Now I want you to get out there and give 'em hell. <span>Not</span><span> for me. Not for the goddam captain.' He shifted the butt of an imaginary cigar from one side of his mouth to the other, and pushed back a non-existent tin helmet, and rasped, 'But for Corporal Walkowski and his little dawg.'</span></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They stared at him in disbelief.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On cue, someone shook a sheet of tin and broke the spell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel rolled his eyes. He'd grown up in the mountains, where thunderstorms stalked from peak to peak on legs of lightning. He remembered thunderstorms that left mountains a different shape and flattened whole forests. Somehow, a sheet of tin wasn't the same, no matter how enthusiastically it was shaken.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Just once, he thought, just once. Let me get it right just once.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He opened his eyes and glared at the witches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What are you hanging around here for?' he yelled. 'Get out there and <em class="calibre10">curse</em> them!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He watched them scamper on to the stage, and then Tomjon tapped him on the head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hwel, there's no crown.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hmm?' said the dwarf, his mind wrestling with ways of building thunder-and-lightning machines.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's no crown, Hwel. I've got to wear a crown.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course there's a crown. The big one with the red glass, very impressive, we used it in that place with the big square—'</span>

        <span>'I think we left it there.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another tinny roll of thunder but, even so, the part of Hwel that was living the play heard a faltering voice on stage. He darted to the wings.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—I have smother'd many a babe—' he hissed, and sprinted back.</span>

        <span>'Well, just find another one, then,' he said vaguely. 'In the props box. You're the Evil King, you've got to have a crown. Get on with it, lad, you're on in a few minutes. Improvise.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon wandered back to the box. He'd grown up among crowns, big golden crowns made of wood and plaster, studded with finest glass. He'd cut his teeth on the hat-brims of Authority. But most of them had been left in the Dysk now. He pulled out collapsible daggers and skulls and vases, the strata of the years and, right at the bottom, his fingers closed on something thin and crown shaped, which no-one had ever wanted to wear because it looked so uncrownly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It would be nice to say it tingled under his hand. Perhaps it did.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny was sitting as still as a statue, and almost as cold. The horror of realisation was stealing over her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's us,' she said. 'Round that silly cauldron. That's meant to be us, Gytha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg paused with a walnut halfway to her gums. She listened to the words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I never shipwrecked anybody!' she said. 'They just said they shipwreck people! I never did!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Up in the tower Magrat elbowed the Fool in the ribs.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Green blusher,' she said, staring at the 3rd Witche. 'I don't look like that. I don't, do I?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Absolutely not,' said the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And that hair!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool peered through the crenellations like an over-eager gargoyle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It looks like straw,' he said. 'Not very clean, either.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He hesitated, picking at the lichened stonework with his fingers; Before he'd left the city he'd asked Hwel for a few suitable words to say to a young lady, and he had been memorising them on the way home. It was now or never.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'd like to know if I could compare you to a summer's day. Because – well, June 12th was quite nice, and . . .Oh. You've gone . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>King Verence gripped the edge of his seat; his fingers went through it. Tomjon had strutted on to the stage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's him, isn't it? That's my son?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The uncracked walnut fell from Nanny Ogg's fingers and rolled on to the floor. She nodded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Verence turned a haggard, transparent face towards her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But what is he doing? What is he saying?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny shook her head. The king listened with his mouth open as Tomjon, lurching crabwise across the stage, launched into his major speech.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think he's meant to be you,' said Nanny, distantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I never walked like that! Why's he got a hump on his back? What's happened to his leg?' He listened some more, and added, in horrified tones, 'And I certainly never did <em class="calibre10">that!</em> Or that. Why is he saying I did that?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The look he gave Nanny was full of pleading. She shrugged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The king reached up, lifted off his spectral crown, and examined it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And it's my crown he's wearing! Look, this is it! And he's saying I did all those—' He paused for a minute, to listen to the latest couplet, and added, 'All right. Maybe I did <em class="calibre10">that.</em> So I set fire to a few cottages. But everyone does that. It's good for the building industry, anyway.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He put the ghostly crown back on his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why's he saying all this about me?' he pleaded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's art,' said Nanny. 'It wossname, holds a mirror up to life.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny turned slowly in her seat to look at the audience. They were staring at the performance, their faces rapt. The words washed over them in the breathless air. This was real. This was more real even than reality. This was history. It might not be true, but that had nothing to do with it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny had never had much time for words. They were so insubstantial. Now she wished that she had found the time. Words were indeed insubstantial. They were as soft as water, but they were also as powerful as water and now they were rushing over the audience, eroding the levees of veracity, and carrying away the past.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>That's us down there, she thought. Everyone knows who we really are, but the things down there are what they'll remember – three gibbering old baggages in pointy hats. All we've ever done, all we've ever been, won't exist any more.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked at the ghost of the king. Well, he'd been no worse than any other king. Oh, he might burn down the odd cottage every now and again, in a sort of absent-minded way, but only when he was really angry about something, and he could give it up any time he liked. Where he wounded the world, he left the kind of wounds that healed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Whoever wrote this Theatre knew about the uses of magic. Even I believe what's happening, and I know there's no truth in it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This is Art holding a Mirror up to Life. That's why everything is exactly the wrong way round.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>We've lost. There is nothing we can do against this without becoming exactly what we aren't.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg gave her a violent nudge in the ribs.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Did you hear that?' she said. 'One of 'em said we put babbies in the cauldron! They've done a slander on me! I'm not sitting here and have 'em say we put babbies in a cauldron!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny grabbed her shawl as she tried to stand up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't do anything!' she hissed. 'It'll make things worse.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "Ditch-delivered by adrabe", they said. That'll be young Millie Hipwood, who didn't dare tell her mum and then went out gathering firewood. I was up all night with that one,' Nanny muttered. 'Fine girl she produced. It's a slander! What's a drabe?' she added.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Words,' said Granny, half to herself. 'That's all that's left. Words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And now there's a man with a trumpet come on. What's he going to do? Oh. End of Act One,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The words won't be forgotten, thought Granny. They've got a power to them. They're damn good words, as words go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was yet another rattle of thunder, which ended with the kind of crash made, for example, by a sheet of tin escaping from someone's hands and hitting the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In the world outside the stage the heat pressed down like a pillow, squeezing the very life out of the air. Granny saw a footman bend down to the duke's ear. No, he won't stop the play. Of course he won't. He wants it to run its course.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke must have felt the heat of her gaze on the back of his neck. He turned, focused on her, and gave her a strange little smile. Then he nudged his wife. They both laughed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax was often angry. She considered it one of her strong points. Genuine anger was one of the world's great creative forces. But you had to learn how to control it. That didn't mean you let it trickle away. It meant you dammed it, carefully, let it develop a working head, let it drown whole valleys of the mind and then, just when the whole structure was about to collapse, opened a tiny pipeline at the base and let the iron-hard stream of wrath power the turbines of revenge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She felt the land below her, even through several feet of foundations, flagstones, one thickness of leather and two thicknesses of sock. She felt it waiting.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She heard the king say, 'My own flesh and blood? Why has he done this to me? I'm going to confront him!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She gently took Nanny Ogg's hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Come, Gytha,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Lord Felmet sat back in his throne and beamed madly at the world, which was looking good right at the moment. Things were working out better than he had dared to hope. He could feel the past melting behind him, like ice in the spring thaw.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On an impulse he called the footman back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Call the captain of the guard,' he said, 'and tell him to find the witches and arrest them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess snorted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Remember what happened last time, foolish man?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We left two of them loose,' said the duke. 'This time . . . all three. The tide of public feeling is on our side. That sort of thing affects witches, depend upon it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess cracked her knuckles to indicate her view of public opinion.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You must admit, my treasure, that the experiment seems to be working.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It would appear so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very well. Don't just stand there, man. Before the play ends, tell him. Those witches are to be under lock and key.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death adjusted his cardboard skull in front of the mirror, twitched his cowl into a suitable shape, stood back and considered the general effect. It was going to be his first speaking part. He wanted to get it right.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cower now, Brief Mortals,' he said. 'For I am Death, 'Gainst Whom No . . . no . . . no . . . </span>Hwel, 'gainst whom no?'</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, good grief, Dafe. " 'Gainst whom no lock will hold nor fasten'd portal bar", I really don't see why you have difficulty with . . . not that way up, you idiots!' Hwel strode off through the backstage melee in pursuit of a pair of importunate scene shifters.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right,' said Death, to no-one in particular. He turned back to the mirror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">' 'Gainst Whom No . . . Tumpty-Tum . . . nor Tumpty-Tumpty bar,' he said, uncertainly, and flourished his scythe. <span>The end fell off.</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you think I'm fearsome enough?' he said, as he tried to fix it on again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon, who was sitting on his hump and trying to drink some tea, gave him an encouraging nod.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No problem, my friend,' he said. 'Compared to a visit from you, even Death himself would hold no fears. But you could try a bit more hollowness.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How d'you mean?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon put down his cup. Shadows seemed to move across his face; his eyes sank, his lips drew back from his teeth, his skin stretched and paled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'</span>
        <span>
          <span>I HAVE COME TO GET YOU, YOU TERRIBLE ACTOR,</span>
        </span>
        <span>' he intoned, each syllable falling into place like a coffin lid. His features sprang back into shape.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Like that,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dafe, who had flattened himself against the wall, relaxed a bit and gave a nervous giggle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Gods, I don't know how you do it,' he said. 'Honestly, I'll never be as good as you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There really isn't anything to it. Now run along, Hwel's fit to be tied as it is.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dafe gave him a look of gratitude and ran off to help with the scene shifting.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon sipped his tea uneasily, the backstage noises whirring around him like so much fog. He was worried.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel had said that everything about the play was fine, except for the play itself. And Tomjon kept thinking that the play itself was trying to force itself into a different shape. His mind had been hearing other words, just too faint for hearing. It was almost like eavesdropping on a conversation. He'd had to shout more to drown out the buzzing in his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This wasn't right. Once a play was written it was, well, written. It shouldn't come alive and start twisting itself around.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No wonder everyone needed prompting all the time. The play was writhing under their hands, trying to change itself.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Ye gods, he'd be glad to get out of this spooky castle, and away from this mad duke. He glanced around, decided that it would be some time before the next act was called, and wandered aimlessly in search of fresher air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A door yielded to his touch and he stepped out on to the battlements. He pushed it shut behind him, cutting off the sounds of the stage and replacing them by a velvet hush. There was a livid sunset imprisoned behind bars of cloud, but the air was as still as a mill pond and as hot as a furnace. In the forest below some night bird screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He walked to the other end of the battlements and peered down into the sheer depths of the gorge. Far beneath, the Lancre boiled in its eternal mists.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He turned, and walked into a draught of such icy coldness that he gasped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Unusual breezes plucked at his clothing. There was a strange muttering in his ear, as though someone was-trying to talk to him but couldn't get the speed right. He stood rigid for a moment, getting his breath, and then fled for the door.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we're <em class="calibre10">not</em> witches!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why do you look like them, then? Tie their hands, lads.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, excuse me, but we're not <em class="calibre10">really</em> witches!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The captain of the guard looked from face to face. His gaze took in the pointy hats, the disordered hair smelling of damp haystacks, the sickly green complexions and the herd of warts. Guard captain for the duke wasn't a job that offered long-term prospects for those who used initiative. Three witches had been called for, and these seemed to fit the bill.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The captain never went to the theatre. When he was on the rack of adolescence he'd been badly frightened by a Punch and Judy show, and since then had taken pains to avoid any organised entertainment and had kept away from anywhere where crocodiles could conceivably be expected. He'd spent the last hour enjoying a quiet drink in the guardroom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said tie their hands, didn't I?' he snapped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shall we gag them as well, cap'n?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But if you'd just <em class="calibre10">listen,</em> we're with the theatre—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said the captain, shuddering. 'Gag them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Please . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The captain leaned down and stared at three pairs of frightened eyes. He was trembling.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That,' he said, 'is the last time <em class="calibre10">you'll</em> eat anyone's sausage.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was aware that now the soldiers were giving him odd looks as well. He coughed and pulled himself together.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very well then, my theatrical witches,' he said. 'You've done your show, and now it's time for your applause.' He nodded to his men.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Clap them in chains,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Three other witches sat in the gloom behind the stage, staring vacantly into the darkness. Granny Weatherwax had picked up a copy of the script, which she peered at from time to time, as if seeking ideas.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "Divers alarums and excursions",' she read, uncertainly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That means lots of terrible happenings,' said Magrat. 'You always put that in plays.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Alarums and what?' said Nanny Ogg, who hadn't been listening.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Excursions,' said Magrat patiently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh.' Nanny Ogg brightened a bit. 'The seaside would be nice,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do shut up, Gytha,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'They're not for you. They're only for divers, like it says. Probably so they can recover from all them alarums.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We can't let this happen,' said Magrat, quickly and loudly. 'If this gets about, witches'll always be old hags with green blusher.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And meddlin' in the affairs of kings,' said Nanny. 'Which we never do, as is well known.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not the meddlin' I object to,' said Granny Weatherwax, her chin on her hand. 'It's the <em class="calibre10">evil</em> meddling.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And the unkindness to animals,' muttered Magrat. 'All that stuff about eye of dog and ear of toad. <em class="calibre10">No-one</em> uses that kind of stuff.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg carefully avoided one another's faces.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Drabe!' said Nanny Ogg bitterly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Witches just aren't like that,' said Magrat. 'We live in harmony with the great cycles of Nature, and do no harm to anyone, and it's wicked of them to say we don't. We ought to fill their bones with hot lead.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The other two looked at her with a certain amount of surprised admiration. She blushed, although not greenly, and looked at her knees.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Goodie Whemper did a recipe,' she confessed. 'It's quite easy. What you do is, you get some lead, and you—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't think that would be appropriate,' said Granny carefully, after a certain amount of internal struggle. 'It could give people the wrong idea.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But not for long,' said Nanny wistfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, we can't be having with that sort of thing,' said Granny, a little more firmly this time. 'We'd never hear the last of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why don't we just change the words?' said Magrat. 'When they come back on stage we could just put the 'fluence on them so they forget what they're saying, and give them some new words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose you're an expert at theatre words?' said Granny sarcastically. 'They'd have to be the proper sort, otherwise people would suspect.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Shouldn't be too difficult,' said Nanny Ogg dismissively. 'I've been studyin' it. You go tumpty-tumpty-tumpty.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny gave this some consideration.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's more to it than that, I believe,' she said. 'Some of those speeches were very good. I couldn't understand hardly any of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's no trick to it at all,' Nanny Ogg insisted. 'Anyway, half of them are forgetting their lines as it is. It'll be easy.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We could put words in their mouths?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg nodded. 'I don't know about <em class="calibre10">new</em> words,' she said. 'But we can make them forget these words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They both looked at Granny Weatherwax. She shrugged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose it's worth a try,' she conceded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Witches as yet unborn will thank us for it,' said Magrat ardently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, good,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'At last! What are you three playing at? We've been looking for you everywhere!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches turned to see an irate dwarf trying to loom over them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Us?' said Magrat. 'But we're not in—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh yes you are, remember, we put it in last week. Act Two, Downstage, around the cauldron. You haven't got to say anything. You're symbolising occult forces at work. Just be as wicked as you can. Come on, there's good lads. You've done well so far.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel slapped Magrat on the bottom. 'Good complexion you've got mere, Wilph,' he said encouragingly. 'But for goodness' sake use a bit more padding, you're still the wrong shape. Fine warts there, Billem. I must say,' he added, standing back, 'you look as nasty a bunch of hags as a body might hope to clap eyes on. Well done. Shame about the wigs. Now run along. Curtain up in one minute. Break a leg.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He gave Magrat another ringing slap on her rump, slightly hurting his hand, and hurried off to shout at someone else.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>None of the witches dared to speak. Magrat and Nanny Ogg found themselves instinctively turning towards Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She sniffed. She looked up. She looked around. She looked at the brightly lit stage behind her. She brought her hands together with a clap that echoed around the castle, and then rubbed them together.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Useful,' she said grimly. 'Let's do the show right here.' Nanny squinted sullenly after Hwel. 'Break your own leg,' she muttered.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel stood in the wings and gave the signal for the curtains. And for the thunder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It didn't come.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Thunder!' he hissed, in a voice heard by half the audience. 'Get on with it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A voice from behind the nearest pillar wailed, 'I went and bent the thunder, Hwel! It just goes clonk-clonk!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel stood silent for a moment, counting. The company watched him, awestruck but not, unfortunately, thunderstruck.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At last he raised his fists to the open sky and said, 'I wanted a storm! Just a storm. Not even a big storm. Any storm. Now I want to make myself absolutely CLEAR! I have had ENOUGH! I want thunder right NOW!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The stab of lightning that answered him turned the multi-hued shadows of the castle into blinding white and searing black. It was followed by a roll of thunder, on cue.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was the loudest noise Hwel had ever heard. It seemed to start inside his head and work its way outwards.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It went on and on, shaking every stone in the castle. Dust rained down. A distant turret broke away with balletic slowness and, tumbling end over end, dropped gently into the hungry depths of the gorge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When it finished it left a silence that rang like a bell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel looked up at the sky. Great black clouds were blowing across the castle, blotting out the stars.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The storm was back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It had spent ages learning its craft. It had spent years lurking in distant valleys. It had practised for hours in front of a glacier. It had studied the great storms of the past. It had honed its art to perfection. And now, tonight, with what it could see was clearly an appreciative audience waiting for it, it was going to take them by, well . . . tempest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel smiled. Perhaps the gods <em class="calibre10">did</em> listen, after all. He wished he'd asked for a really good wind machine as well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He gestured frantically at Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Get on with it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The boy nodded, and launched into his main speech.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'And now our domination is complete—'</span>
        </em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Behind him on the stage the witches bent over the cauldron.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's just tin, this one,' hissed Nanny. 'And it's full of all yuk.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And the fire is just red paper,' whispered Magrat. 'It looked so real from up there, it's just red paper! Look, you can poke it—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Never mind,' said Granny. 'Just look busy, and wait until I say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>As the Evil King and the Good Duke began the exchange that was going to lead to the exciting Duel Scene they became uncomfortably aware of activity behind them, and occasional chuckles from the audience. After a totally inappropriate burst of laughter Tomjon risked a sideways glance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>One of the witches was taking their fire to bits. Another one was trying to clean the cauldron. The third one was sitting with her arms folded, glaring at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'The very soil cries out at tyranny—'</span>
        </em>
        <span> said Wimsloe, and then caught the expression on Tomjon's face and followed his gaze. His voice trailed into silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "And calls me forth for vengeance",' prompted Tomjon helpfully.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'B-but—' whispered Wimsloe, trying to point surreptitiously with his dagger.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wouldn't be seen dead with a cauldron like this,' said Nanny Ogg, in a whisper loud enough to carry to the back of the courtyard. 'Two days' work with a scourer and a bucket of sand, is this.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>' "And calls me forth for vengeance" ' hissed Tomjon. Out of the tail of his eye he saw Hwel in the wings, frozen in an attitude of incoherent rage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'How do they make it flicker?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Be quiet, you two,' said Granny. </span>'You're upsetting people.' She raised her hat to Wimsloe. <span>'Go ahead, young man. Don't mind us.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wha?' said Wimsloe.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aha, it calls you forth for vengeance, does it?' said Tomjon. in desperation. 'And the heavens cry revenge, too, I expect.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On cue, the storm produced a thunderbolt that blew the top off another tower . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke crouched in his seat, his face a panorama of fear. He extended what had once been a finger.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There they are,' he breathed. 'That's them. What are they doing in my play? Who said they could be in my play?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess, who was less inclined to deal in rhetorical questions, beckoned to the nearest guard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On stage Tomjon was sweating under the load of the script. Wimsloe was incoherent. Now Gumridge, who was playing the part of the Good Duchess in a wig of flax, had lost the thread as well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aha, thou callst me an evil king, though thou wisperest it so none save I may hear it,' Tomjon croaked. 'And thou hast <em class="calibre10">summoned the guard,</em> possibly by some most secret signal, owing nought to artifice of lips or tongue.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A guard came on crabwise, still stumbling from Hwel's shove. He stared at Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hwel says what the hell's going on?' he hissed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What was that?' said Tomjon. 'Did I hear you say / <em class="calibre10">come, my lady?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Get these people off, he says!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon advanced to the front of the stage.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Thou babblest, man. See how I dodge thy tortoise spear. I <em class="calibre10">said,</em> see how I dodge thy tortoise spear. Thy spear, man. You're holding it in thy bloody hand, for goodness' sake.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The guard gave him a desperate, frozen grin.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon hesitated. Three other actors around him were staring fixedly at the witches. Looming up in front of him with all the inevitability of a tax demand was a sword fight during which, it was beginning to appear, he would have to parry his own wild thrusts and stab himself to death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He turned to the three witches. His mouth opened.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>For the first time in his life his awesome memory let him down. He could think of nothing to say.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax stood up. She advanced to the edge of the stage. The audience held its breath. She held up a hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ghosts of the mind and all device away, I bid the Truth to have—' she hesitated – 'its tumpty-tumpty day.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon felt the chill engulf him. The others, too, jolted into life.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Up from out of the depths of their blank minds new words rushed, words red with blood and revenge, words that had echoed among the castle's stones, words stored in silicon, words that would have themselves heard, words that gripped their mouths so tightly that an attempt not to say them would result in a broken jaw.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you fear him now?' said Gumridge. 'And he so mazed with drink? Take his dagger, husband – you are a blade's width from the kingdom.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I dare not,' Wimsloe said, trying to look in astonishment at his own lips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who will know?' Gumridge waved a hand towards the audience. He'd never act so well again. 'See, there is only eyeless night. Take the dagger now, take the kingdom tomorrow. Have a stab at it, man.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe's hand shook.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I have it, wife,' he said. 'Is this a dagger I see before me?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course it's a bloody dagger. Come on, do it now. The weak deserve no mercy. We'll say he fell down the stairs.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But people will suspect!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are there no dungeons? Are there no pilliwinks? Possession is nine parts of the law, husband, when what you possess is a knife.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe drew his arm back.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I cannot! He has been kindness itself to me!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you can be Death itself to him . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dafe could hear the voices a long way off. He adjusted his mask, checked the deathliness of his appearance in the mirror, and peered at the script in the empty backstage gloom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Cower Now, Brief Mortals,' he said. 'I Am Death, 'Gainst Who – 'Gainst Who—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>WHOM.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, thanks,' said the boy distractedly. ' 'Gainst Whom No Lock May Hold—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>WILL HOLD.</span>

        <span>
          <span>HERE TO TAKE MY TALLY ON THIS NIGHT OF KINGS.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dafe sagged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're so much better at it,' he moaned. 'You've got the right voice and you can remember the words.' He turned around. 'It's only three lines and Hwel will . . . have . . . my . . . guts . . . for.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He froze. His eyes widened and became two saucers of fear as Death snapped his fingers in front of the boy's rigid face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>FORGET, he commanded, and turned and stalked silently towards the wings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His eyeless skull took in the line of costumes, the waxy debris of the makeup table. His empty nostrils snuffed up the mixed smells of mothballs, grease and sweat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was something here, he thought, that nearly belonged to the gods. Humans had built a world inside the world, which reflected it in pretty much the same way as a drop of water reflects the landscape. And yet . . . and yet . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Inside this little world they had taken pains to put all the things, you might think they would want to escape from – hatred, fear, tyranny, and so forth. Death was intrigued. They thought they wanted to be taken out of themselves, and every art humans dreamt up took them further in. He was fascinated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was here for a very particular and precise purpose. There was a soul to be claimed. There was no time for inconsequentialities. But what was time, after all?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>His feet did an involuntary little clicking dance across the stones. Alone, in the grey shadows, Death tapdanced.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>—</span>
        <span>
          <span>THE NEXT NIGHT IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM THEY HANG A STAR</span>
        </span>
        <span>—</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He pulled himself together, adjusted his scythe, and waited silently for his cue.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He'd never missed one yet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He was going to get out there and slay them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you can be Death itself to him. Now!' Death entered, his feet clicking across the stage. </span>
        <span>
          <span>COWER NOW, BRIEF MORTALS,</span>
        </span>
        <span> he said, </span>
        <span>
          <span>FOR I AM DEATH, 'GAINST WHOM NO . . . </span>
        </span>
        <span>
          <span>NO . . . 'GAINST WHOM . . .</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He hesitated. He hesitated, for the very first time in the eternity of his existence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>For although the Death of the Discworld was used to dealing with people by the million, at the same time every death was intimate and personal.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death was seldom seen except by those of an occult persuasion and his clients themselves. The reason that no-one else saw him was that the human brain is clever enough to edit sights too horrible for it to cope with, but the problem here was that several hundred people were in fact <em class="calibre10">expecting</em> to see Death at this point, and were therefore seeing him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death turned slowly and stared back at hundreds of watching eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Even in the grip of the truth Tomjon recognised a fellow actor in distress, and fought for mastery of his lips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">' ". . . lock will hold . . ." ' he whispered, through teeth fixed in a grimace.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death gave him a manic grin of stagefright.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>WHAT?</span>
        </span>
        <span> he whispered, in a voice like an anvil being hit with a small lead hammer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">' ". . . lock will hold, nor fasten'd portal . . .",' said Tomjon encouragingly.</div>

          <span>. . . LOCK WILL HOLD NOR FASTEN'D PORTAL . . . UH . . .</span>

      <div class="paragraph">' ". . . bar! . . ." '</div>

        <span>'No, I cannot do it!' said Wimsloe. 'I will be seen! Down there in the hall, someone watches!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There is no-one!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I feel the stare!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Dithering idiot! Must I put it in for you? See, his foot is upon the top stair!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Wimsloe's face contorted with fear and uncertainty. He drew back his hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The scream came from the audience. The duke was half-risen from his seat, his tortured knuckles at his mouth. As they watched he lurched forward between the shocked people.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No! I did not do it! It was not like that! You cannot say it was like that! You were not there!' He stared at the upturned faces around him, and sagged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nor was I,' he giggled. 'I was asleep at the time, you know. I remember it quite well. There was blood on the counterpane, there was blood on the floor, I could not wash off the blood, but these are not proper subjects for the inquiry. I cannot allow the discussion of national security. It was just a dream, and when I awoke, he'd be alive tomorrow. And tomorrow it wouldn't have happened because it was not done. And tomorrow you can say I did not know. And tomorrow you can say I had no recollection. What a noise he made in falling! Enough to wake the dead . . . who would have thought he had so much blood in him? . . .' By now he had climbed on to the stage, and grinned brightly at the assembled company.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I hope that sorts it all out,' he said. 'Ha. Ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>In the silence that followed Tomjon opened his mouth to utter something suitable, something soothing, and found that there was nothing he could say.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>But another personality stepped into him, took over his lips, and spoke thusly:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'With my own bloody dagger, you bastard! I know it was you! I saw you at the top of the stairs, sucking your thumb! I'd kill you now, except for the thought of having to spend eternity listening to your whining. I, Verence, formerly King of-'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What testimony is this?' said the duchess. She stood in front of the stage, with half a dozen soldiers beside her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'These are just slanders,' she added. 'And treason to boot. The rantings of mad players.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was bloody King of Lancre!' shouted Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'In which case you are the alleged victim,' said the duchess calmly. 'And unable to speak for the prosecution. It is against all precedent.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon's body turned towards Death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You were there! You saw it all!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>I SUSPECT I WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN APPROPRIATE WITNESS.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Therefore there is no proof, and where there is no proof there is no crime,' said the duchess. She motioned the soldiers forward.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So much for your experiment,' she said to her husband. 'I think my way is better.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She looked around the stage, and found the witches.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Arrest them,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' said the Fool, stepping out of the wings.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'What</span>
        </em>
        <span> did you say?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I saw it all,' said the Fool, simply. 'I was in the Great Hall that night. You killed the king, my lord.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I did not!' screamed the duke. 'You were not there! I did not see you there! I <em class="calibre10">order</em> you not to be there!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You did not dare say this before,' said Lady Felmet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, lady. But I must say it now.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke focused unsteadily on him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You swore loyalty unto death, my Fool,' he hissed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, my lord. I'm sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're <em class="calibre10">dead.'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke snatched a dagger from Wimsloe's-unresisting hand, darted forward, and plunged it to the hilt into the Fool's heart. Magrat screamed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Fool rocked back and forth unsteadily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Thank goodness that's over,' he said, as Magrat pushed her way through the actors and clasped him to what could charitably be called her bosom. It struck the Fool that he had never looked a bosom squarely in the face, at least since he was a baby, and it was particularly cruel of the world to save the experience until after he was dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He gently moved one of Magrat's arms and pulled the despicable horned cowl from his head, and tossed it as far as possible. He didn't have to be a Fool any more or, he realised, bother about vows or anything. What with bosoms as well, death seemed to be an improvement.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I didn't do it,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No pain, thought the Fool. Funny, that. On the other hand, you obviously can't feel pain when you are dead. It would be wasted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You all saw that I didn't do it,' said the duke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death gave the Fool a puzzled look. Then he reached into the recesses of his robes and pulled out an hourglass. It had bells on it. He gave it a gentle shake, which made them tinkle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I gave no orders that any such thing should be done,' said the duke calmly. His voice came from a long way off, from wherever his mind was now. The company stared at him wordlessly. It wasn't possible to hate someone like this, only to feel acutely embarrassed about being anywhere near him. Even the Fool felt embarrassed, and he was dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death tapped the hourglass, and then peered at it to see if it had gone wrong.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You are all lying,' said the duke, in tranquil tones. 'Telling lies is naughty.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stabbed several of the nearest actors in a dreamy, gentle way, and then held up the blade.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You see?' he said. 'No blood! It wasn't me.' He looked up at the duchess, towering over him now like a red tsunami over a small fishing village.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was her,' he said. 'She did it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stabbed her once or twice, on general principles, and then stabbed himself and let the dagger drop from his fingers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a few seconds reflection he said, in a voice far nearer the worlds of sanity, 'You can't get me now.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He turned to Death. 'Will there be a comet?' he said. 'There must be a comet when a prince dies. I'll go and see, shall I?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He wandered away. The audience broke into applause.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You've got to admit he was real royalty,' said Nanny Ogg, eventually. 'It only goes to show, royalty goes eccentric far better than the likes of you and me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death held the hourglass to his skull, his face radiating puzzlement.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax picked up the fallen dagger and tested the blade with her finger. It slid into the handle quite easily, with a faint squeaking noise.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She passed it to Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There's your magic sword,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked at it, and then back at the Fool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you dead or not?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I must be,' said the Fool, his voice slightly muffled. 'I think I'm in paradise.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, look, I'm serious.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know. But I'd like to breathe.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Then you must be alive.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Everyone's alive,' said Granny. 'It's a trick dagger. Actors probably can't be trusted with real ones.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'After all, they can't even keep a cauldron clean,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whether everyone is alive or not is a matter for me,' said the duchess. 'As ruler it is my pleasure to decide. Clearly my husband has lost his wits.' She turned to her soldiers. 'And I decree—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Now!' hissed King Verence in Granny's ear. 'Now!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax drew herself up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Be silent, woman!' she said. 'The true King of Lancre stands before you!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She clapped Tomjon on the shoulder.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What, him?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who, me?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ridiculous,' said the duchess. 'He's a mummer, of sorts.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's right, miss,' said Tomjon, on the edge of panic. 'My father runs a theatre, not a kingdom.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He is the true king. We can prove it,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, no,' said the duchess. 'We're not having that. There's no mysterious returned heirs in this kingdom. Guards – take him.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax held up a hand. The soldiers lurched from foot to foot, uncertainly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She's a witch, isn't she?' said one of them, tentatively.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly,' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The guards shifted uneasily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We seen where they turn people into newts,' said one.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And then shipwreck them.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yeah, and alarum the divers.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yeah.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We ought to talk about this. We ought to get extra for witches.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She could do anything to us, look. She could be a drabe, even.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't be foolish,' said the duchess. 'Witches don't do that sort of thing. They're just stories to frighten people.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The guard shook his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It looked pretty convincing to me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Of course it did, it was <em class="calibre10">meant—'</em> the duchess began.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She sighed, and snatched a spear out of the guard's hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'll show you the power of these witches,' she said, and hurled it at Granny's face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny moved her hand across at snakebite speed and caught the spear just behind the head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'So,' she said, 'and it comes to this, does it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You don't frighten me, wyrd sisters,' said the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny stared her in the eye for a few seconds. She gave a grunt of surprise.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're right,' she said. 'We really don't, do we . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Do you think I haven't studied you? Your witchcraft is all artifice and illusion, to amaze weak minds. It holds no fears for me. Do your worst.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny studied her for a while.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'My worst?' she said, eventually. Magrat and Nanny Ogg shuffled gently out of her way.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess laughed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're clever,' she said. 'I'll grant you that much. And quick. Come on, hag. Bring on your toads and demons, I'll . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stopped, her mouth opening and shutting a bit without any words emerging. Her lips drew back in a rictus of terror, her eyes looked beyond Granny, beyond the world, towards something else. One knuckled hand flew to her mouth and she made a little whimpering noise. She froze, like a rabbit that has just seen a stoat and knows, without any doubt, that it is the last stoat that it will ever see.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What have you done to her?' said Magrat, the first to dare to speak. Granny smirked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Headology,' said Granny, and smirked. 'You don't need any Black Aliss magic for it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but what have you <em class="calibre10">done?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No-one becomes like she is without building walls inside their head,' she said. Tve just knocked them down. Every scream. Every plea. Every pang of guilt. Every twinge of conscience. All at once. There's a little trick to it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She gave Magrat a condescending smile. 'I'll show you one day, if you like.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat thought about it. 'It's horrible,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Nonsense,' Granny smiled terribly. 'Everyone wants to know their true self. Now, she does.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sometimes you have to be kind to be cruel,' said Nanny Ogg approvingly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think it's probably the worst thing that could happen to anyone,' said Magrat, as the duchess swayed backwards and forwards.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'For goodness' sake use your imagination, girl,' said Granny. 'There are far worse things. Needles under the fingernails, for one. Stuff with pliers.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Red-hot knives up the jacksie,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Handle first, too, so you cut your fingers trying to pull them out—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'This is simply the worst that I can do,' said Granny Weatherwax primly. 'It's all right and proper, too. A witch should act like that, you know. There's no need for any dramatic stuff. Most magic goes on in the head. It's headology. Now, if you'd—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A noise like a gas leak escaped from the duchess's lips. Her head jerked back suddenly. She opened her eyes, blinked, and focused on Granny. Sheer hatred suffused her features.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Guards!' she said. 'I told you to take them!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's jaw sagged. 'What?' she said. 'But – but I showed you your true self . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm supposed to be upset by that, am I?' As the soldiers sheepishly grabbed Granny's arms the duchess pressed her face close to Granny's, her tremendous eyebrows a V of triumphant hatred. 'I'm supposed to grovel on the floor, is that it? Well, old woman, I've seen exactly what I am, do you understand, and I'm proud of it! I'd do it all again, only hotter and longer! I enjoyed it, and I did it because I wanted to!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She thumped the vast expanse of her chest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You gawping idiots!' she said. 'You're so <em class="calibre10">weak.</em> You really think that people are basically decent underneath, don't you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The crowd on the stage backed away from the sheer force of her exultation.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I've looked underneath,' said the duchess. 'I know what drives people. It's fear. Sheer, deep-down fear. There's not one of you who doesn't fear me, I can make you widdle your drawers out of terror, and now I'm going to take—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At this point Nanny Ogg hit her on the back of the head with the cauldron.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'She does go on, doesn't she?' she said conversationally, as the duchess collapsed. 'She was a bit eccentric, if you ask me.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a long, embarrassed silence.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax coughed. Then she treated the soldiers holding her to a bright, friendly smile, and pointed to the mound that was now the duchess.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Take her away and put her in a cell somewhere,' she commanded. The men snapped to attention, grabbed the duchess by her arms, and pulled her upright with considerable difficulty.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Gently, mind,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She rubbed her hands together and turned to Tomjon, who was watching her with his mouth open.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Depend on it,' she hissed. 'Here and now, my lad, you don't have a choice. You're the King of Lancre.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I don't know how to be a king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We all seed you! You had it down just right, including the shouting.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's just acting!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Act, then. Being a king is, is—' Granny hesitated, and snapped her fingers at Magrat. 'What do you call them things, there's always a hundred of them in anything?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat looked bewildered. 'Do you mean per cents?' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Them,' agreed Granny. 'Most of the per cents in being a king is acting, if you ask me. You ought to be good at it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon looked for help into the wings, where Hwel should have been. The dwarf was in fact there, but he wasn't paying much attention. He had the script in front of him, and was rewriting furiously.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>BUT I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE NOT DEAD. TAKE IT FROM ME.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke giggled. He had found a sheet from somewhere and had draped it over himself, and was sidling along some of the castle's more deserted corridors. Sometimes he would go 'whoo-oo' in a low voice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>This worried Death. He was used to people claiming that they were <em class="calibre10">not</em> dead, because death always came as a shock, and a lot of people had some trouble getting over it. But people claiming that they were dead with every breath in their body was a new and unsettling experience.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I shall jump out on people,' said the duke dreamily. 'I shall rattle my bones all night, I shall perch on the roof and foretell a death in the house—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>THAT'S BANSHEES.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I shall if I want,' said the duke, with a trace of earlier determination. 'And I shall float through walls, and knock on tables, and drip ectoplasm on anyone I don't like. Ha. Ha.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>IT WON'T WORK. LIVING PEOPLE ARENT ALLOWED TO BE GHOSTS. I'M SORRY.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duke made an unsuccessful attempt to float through a wall, gave up, and opened a door out on to a crumbling section of the battlements. The storm had died away a bit, and a thin rind of moon lurked behind the clouds like a ticket tout for eternity.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death stalked through the wall behind him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well then,' said the duke, 'if I'm <em class="calibre10">not</em> dead, why are you here?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He jumped up on to the wall and flapped his sheet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>WAITING.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Wait forever, bone face!' said the duke triumphantly. 'I shall hover in the twilight world, I shall find some chains to shake, I shall—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He stepped backwards, lost his balance, landed heavily on the wall and slid. For a moment the remnant of his right hand scrabbled ineffectually at the stonework, and then it vanished.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death is obviously potentially everywhere at the same time, and in one sense it is no more true to say that he was on the battlements, picking vaguely at non-existent particles of glowing metal on the edge of his scythe blade, than that he was waist-deep in the foaming, rock-toothed waters in the depths of Lancre gorge, his calcareous gaze sweeping downwards and stopping abruptly at a point where the torrent ran a few treacherous inches over a bed of angular pebbles.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a while the duke sat up, transparent in the phosphorescent waves.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I shall haunt their corridors,' he said, 'and whisper under the doors on still nights.' His voice grew fainter, almost lost in the ceaseless roar of the river. 'I shall make basket chairs creak most alarmingly, just you wait and see.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Death grinned at him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>
          <span>NOW YOU'RE TALKING.</span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It started to rain.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Ramtop rain has a curiously penetrative quality which makes ordinary rain seem almost arid. It poured in torrents over the castle roofs, and somehow seemed to go right through the tiles and fill the Great Hall with a warm, uncomfortable moistness<a href="#note_21" title="Like Bognor."><sup class="calibre11">[21]</sup></a>.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The hall was crowded with half the population of Lancre. Outside, the rushing of the rain even drowned out the distant roar of the river. It soaked the stage. The colours ran and mingled in the painted backdrop, and one of the curtains sagged away from its rail and flapped sadly into a puddle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Inside, Granny Weatherwax finished speaking.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You forgot about the crown,' whispered Nanny Ogg.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Ah,' said Granny. 'Yes, the crown. It's on his head, d'you see? We hid it among the crowns when the actors left, the reason being, no-one would look for it there. See how it fits him so perfectly.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was a tribute to Granny's extraordinary powers of persuasion that everyone did see how perfectly it fitted Tomjon. In fact the only one who didn't was Tomjon himself, who was aware that it was only his ears that were stopping it becoming a necklace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Imagine the sensation when he put it on for the first time,' she went on. 'I expect there was an eldritch tingling sensation.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Actually, it felt rather—' Tomjon began, but no-one was listening to him. He shrugged and leaned over to Hwel, who was still scribbling busily.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Does eldritch mean uncomfortable?' he hissed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf looked at him with unfocused eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I said, does eldritch mean uncomfortable?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Eh? Oh. No. No, I shouldn't think so.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What <em class="calibre10">does</em> it mean then?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Dunno. Oblong, I think.' Hwel's glance returned to his scrawls as though magnetised. <span>'Can you remember what he said after all those tomorrows? I didn't catch the bit after that . . .'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And there wasn't any need for you to tell everyone I was – adopted,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's how it was, you see,' said the dwarf vaguely. 'Best to be honest about these things. Now then, did he actually stab her, or just accuse her?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't want to be a king!' Tomjon whispered hoarsely. 'Everyone says I take after dad!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Funny thing, all this taking after people,' said the dwarf vaguely. 'I mean, if I took after <em class="calibre10">my</em> dad, I'd be a hundred feet underground digging rocks, whereas—' His voice died away. He stared at the nib of his pen as though it held an incredible fascination.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Whereas what?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Eh?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Aren't you even <em class="calibre10">listening?'</em></span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I knew it was wrong when I wrote it, I knew it was the wrong way round . . . </span>What? <span>Oh, yes. Be a king. It's a good job. It seems there's a lot of competition, at any rate. I'm very happy for you. Once you're a king, you can do anything you want.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon looked at the faces of the Lancre worthies around the table. They had a keen, calculating look, like the audience at a fatstock show. They were weighing him up. It crept upon him in a cold and clammy way that once he was king, he could do anything he wanted. Provided that what he wanted to do was be king.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You could build your own theatre,' said Hwel, his eyes lighting up for a moment. 'With as many trapdoors as you wanted, and magnificent costumes. You could act in a new play every night. I mean, it would make the Dysk look like a shed.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who would come to see me?' said Tomjon, sagging in his seat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Everyone.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What, every night?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You could order them to,' said Hwel, without looking up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>I knew he was going to say that, Tomjon thought. He can't really mean it, he added charitably. He's got his play. He doesn't really exist in this world, not right now at the moment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He took off the crown and turned it over and over in his hands. There wasn't much metal in it, but it felt heavy. He wondered how heavy it would get if you wore it all the time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>At the head of the table was an empty chair containing, he had been assured, the ghost of his real father. It would have been nice to report that he had experienced anything more, when being introduced to it, than an icy sensation and a buzzing in the ears.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I suppose I could help father pay off on the Dysk,' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That would be nice, yes,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He spun the crown in his fingers and listened glumly to the talk flowing back and forth over his head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fifteen years?' said the Mayor of Lancre.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We had to,' said Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought the baker was a bit early last week.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, no,' said the witch impatiently. 'It doesn't work like that. No-one's lost anything.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'According to my figuring,' said the man who doubled as Lancre's beadle, town clerk and gravedigger, 'we've all lost fifteen years.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, we've all gained them,' said the mayor. 'It stands to reason. Time's like this sort of wiggly road, see, but we took a short cut across the fields.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Not at all,' said the clerk, sliding a sheet of paper across the table. 'Look here . . .'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon let the waters of debate close over him again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Everyone wanted him to be king. No-one thought twice about what he wanted. His views didn't count.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Yes, that was it. No-one wanted <em class="calibre10">him</em> to be king, not precisely <em class="calibre10">him.</em> He just happened to be convenient.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Gold does not tarnish, at least physically, but Tomjon felt that the thin band of metal in his hands had an unpleasant depth to its lustre. It had sat on too many troubled heads. If you held it to your ear, you could hear the screams.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He became aware of someone else looking at him, their gaze playing across his face like a blowlamp on a lolly. He looked up.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was the third witch, the young . . . the youngest one, with the intense expression and the hedgerow hairstyle. Sitting next to old Fool as though she owned a controlling interest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It wasn't his face she was examining. It was his features. Her eyeballs were tracking him from nape to nose like a pair of calipers. He gave her a little brave smile, which she ignored. Just like everyone else, he thought.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Only the Fool noticed him, and returned the smile with an apologetic grin and a tiny conspiratorial wave of the fingers that said: 'What are we doing here, two sensible people like us?' The woman was looking at him again, turning her head this way and that and narrowing her eyes. She kept glancing at Fool and back to Tomjon. Then she turned to the oldest witch, the only person in the entire hot, damp room who seemed to have acquired a mug of beer, and whispered in her ear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The two started a spirited, whispered conversation. It was, thought Tomjon, a particularly feminine way of talking. It normally took place on doorsteps, with all the participants standing with their arms folded and, if anyone was so ungracious as to walk past, they'd stop abruptly and watch them in silence until they were safely out of earshot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He became aware that Granny Weatherwax had stopped talking, and that the entire hall was staring at him expectantly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hallo?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It might be a good idea to hold the coronation tomorrow,' said Granny. 'It's not good for a kingdom to be without a ruler. It doesn't like it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She stood up, pushed back her chair, and came and took Tomjon's hand. He followed her unprotestingly across the flagstones and up the steps to the throne, where she put her hands on his shoulders and pressed him gently down on to the threadbare red plush cushions.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a scraping of benches and chairs. He looked around in panic.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What's happening now?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Don't worry,' said Granny firmly. 'Everyone wants to come and swear loyalty to you. You just nod graciously and ask everyone what they do and if they enjoy it. Oh, and you'd better give them the crown back.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon removed it quickly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'They want to present it to you.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But I've already got it!' said Tomjon desperately.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny gave a patient sigh.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only in the wossname, real sense,' she said. 'This is more ceremonial.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You mean unreal?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Granny. 'But much more important.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon gripped the arms of the throne.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Fetch me Hwel,' he said.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, you must do it like that. It's precedent, you see, first you meet the—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I <em class="calibre10">said,</em> fetch me the dwarf. Didn't you hear me, woman?' This time Tomjon got the spin and pitch of his voice just right, but Granny rallied magnificently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't think you quite realise who you are talking to, young man,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon half rose in his seat. He had played a great many kings, and most of them weren't the kind of kings who shook hands graciously and asked people whether they enjoyed their work. They were far more the type of kings who got people to charge into battle at five o'clock on a freezing morning <em class="calibre10">and still managed to persuade them that this was better than being in bed.</em> He summoned them all, and treated Granny Weatherwax to a blast of royal hauteur, pride and arrogance.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We thought we were talking to a <em class="calibre10">subject,'</em> he said. 'Now do as we say!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny's face was immobile for several seconds as she worked out what to do next. Then she smiled to herself, said lightly, 'As you wish,' and went and dislodged Hwel, who was still writing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The dwarf gave a stiff bow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'None of that,' snapped Tomjon. 'What do I do next?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't know. Do you want me to write an acceptance speech?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I told you. I don't want to be king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Could be a problem with an acceptance speech, then,' the dwarf agreed. 'Have you really thought about this? Being king is a great role.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But it's the only one you get to play!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hmm. Well, just tell them "no", then.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just like that? Will it work?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's got to be worth a try.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A group of Lancre dignitaries were approaching with the crown on a cushion. They wore expressions of constipated respect coupled with just a hint of self-satisfaction. They carried the crown as if it was a Present for a Good Boy.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The Mayor of Lancre coughed behind his hand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A proper coronation will take some time to arrange,' he began, 'but we would like—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' said Tomjon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The mayor hesitated. 'Pardon?' he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I won't accept it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The mayor hesitated again. His lips moved and his eyes glazed slightly. He felt that he had got lost somewhere, and decided it would be best to start again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'A proper coronation will take—' he ventured.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It won't,' said Tomjon. 'I will not be king.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The mayor was mouthing like a carp.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hwel?' said Tomjon desperately. 'You're good with words.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The problem we've got here,' said the dwarf, 'is that "no" is apparently not among the options when you are offered a crown. I think he could cope with "maybe".'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon stood up, and grabbed the crown. He held it above his head like a tambourine.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Listen to me, all of you,' he said. 'I thank you for your offer, it's a great honour. But I can't accept it. I've worn more crowns than you can count, and the only kingdom I know how to rule has got curtains in front of it. I'm sorry.'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Dead silence greeted this. They did not appear to have been the right words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Another problem,' said Hwel conversationally, 'is that you don't actually have a choice. You <em class="calibre10">are</em> the king, you see. It's a job you are lined up for when you're born.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'd be no good at it!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That doesn't matter. A king isn't something you're good at, it's something you are.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You can't leave me here! There's nothing but forests!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon felt the suffocating cold sensation again, and the slow buzzing in his ears. For a moment he thought he saw, faint as a mist, a tall sad man in front of him, stretching out a hand in supplication.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm sorry,' he whispered. 'I really am.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Through the fading shape he saw the witches, watching him intently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Beside him Hwel said, 'The only chance you'd have is if there was another heir. You don't remember any brothers and sisters, do you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't remember anyone! Hwel, I—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another ferocious argument among the witches. And then Magrat was striding, striding across the hall, moving like a tidal wave, moving like a rush of blood to the head, shaking off Granny Weatherwax's restraining hand, bearing down on the throne like a piston, and dragging the Fool behind her.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I say?'</span>

        <span>'Er. Hallo<em class="calibre10">ee</em>!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Er, I say, excuse me, can anyone hear us?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The castle up above was full of hubbub and general rejoicing, and there was no-one to hear the polite and frantic voices that echoed along the dungeon passages, getting politer and more frantic with each passing hour.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Um, I say? Excuse me? Billem's got this terrible <em class="calibre10">thing</em> about rats, if you don't mind. Cooeee!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Let the camera of the mind's eye pan slowly back along the dim, ancient corridors, taking in the dripping fungi, the rusting ehains, the damp, the shadows . . .</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Can anyone hear us? Look, it's really too much. There's been some laughable mistake, look, the wigs come right off. . .'</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Let the plaintive echoes dwindle among the cobwebbed corners and rodent-haunted tunnels, until they're no more than a reedy whisper on the cusp of hearing.</span>

        <span>Someone is bound to come down here again one of these days.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Some time afterwards Magrat asked Hwel if he believed in long engagements. The dwarf paused in the task of loading up the latty<a href="#note_22" title="At least, of supervising the loading. Actual physical assistance was a little difficult because he had, the day before, slipped on something and broken his leg."><sup class="calibre11">[22]</sup></a>.</span>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'About a week, maximum,' he said at last. 'With matinees, of course.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A month went past. The early damp-earth odours of autumn drifted over the velvety-dark moors, where the watery starlight was echoed by one spark of a fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The standing stone was back in its normal place, but still poised to run if any auditors came into view.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches sat in careful silence. This was not going to rate among the hundred most exciting coven meetings of all time. If Mussorgsky had seen them, the night on the bare mountain would have been over by teatime.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Then Granny Weatherwax said, 'It was a good banquet, I thought.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I was nearly sick,' said Nanny Ogg proudly. 'And my Shirl helped out in the kitchen and brought me home some scraps.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I heard,' said Granny coldly. 'Haifa pig and three bottles of fizzy wine went missing, they say.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's nice that some people think of the old folk,' said Nanny Ogg, completely unabashed. </span>'I got a coronation mug, too.' She produced it. <span>'It says "Viva Verence II Rex". Fancy him being called Rex. I can't say it's a good likeness, mind you. I don't recall him having a handle sticking out of his ear.'</span></div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another long, terribly polite pause. Then Granny said, 'We were a bit surprised you weren't there, Magrat.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We thought you'd be up at the top of the table, kind of thing,' said Nanny. 'We thought you'd have moved in up there.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat stared fixedly at her feet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I wasn't invited,' she said meekly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I don't know about <em class="calibre10">invited,'</em> said Granny. 'We weren't <em class="calibre10">invited.</em> People don't have to invite witches, they just know we'll turn up if we want to. They soon find room for us,' she added, with some satisfaction.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You see, he's been very busy,' said Magrat to her feet. 'Sorting everything out, you know. He's very clever, you know. Underneath.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Very sober lad,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Anyway, it's full moon,' said Magrat quickly. 'You've got to go to coven meetings at full moon, no matter what other pressing engagements there may be.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">'Have y—?' Nanny Ogg began, but Granny nudged her sharply in the ribs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's a very good thing he's paying so much attention to getting the kingdom working again,' said Granny, soothingly. 'It shows proper consideration. I daresay he'll get around to everything, sooner or later. It's very demanding, being a king.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Magrat, her voice barely audible.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The silence that followed was almost solid. It was broken by Nanny, in a voice as bright and brittle as ice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, I brought a bottle of that fizzy wine with me,' she said. 'In case he'd . . . in case . . . in case we felt like a drink,' she rallied, and waved it at the other two.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I don't want any,' said Magrat sullenly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You drink up, girl,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'It's a chilly night. It'd be good for your chest.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She squinted at Magrat as the moon drifted out from behind its cloud.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Here,' she said. 'Your hair looks a bit grubby. It looks as though you haven't washed it for a month.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat burst into tears. </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The same moon shone down on the otherwise unremarkable town of Rham Nitz, some ninety miles from Lancre.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon left the stage to thunderous applause at the concluding act of <em class="calibre10">The Troll ofAnkh.</em> A hundred people would go home tonight wondering whether trolls were really as bad as they had hitherto thought although, of course, this wouldn't actually stop them disliking them in any way whatsoever.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel patted him on the back as he sat down at the makeup table and started scraping off the thick grey sludge that was intended to make him look like a walking rock.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well done,' he said. 'The love scene – just right. And when you turned around and roared at the wizard I shouldn't think there was a dry seat in the house.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I know.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel rubbed his hands together.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We can afford a tavern tonight,' he said. 'So if we just—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We'll sleep in the carts,' said Tomjon firmly, squinting at himself in the shard of mirror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you know how much the Fo – the king gave us! It could be feather beds all the way home!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's straw mattresses and a good profit for us,' said Tomjon. 'And that'll buy you gods from heaven and demons from hell and the wind and the waves and more trapdoors than you can count, my lawn ornament.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Hwel's hand rested on Tomjon's shoulder for a moment. Then he said, 'You're right, boss.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Certainly I am. How's the play going?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Hmm? What play?' said Hwel, innocently.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon carefully removed a plaster brow ridge.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You know,' he said. 'That one. The Lancre King.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh. Coming along. Coming along, you know. I'll get it right one of these days.' Hwel changed the subject with speed. 'You know, we could work our way down to the river and take a boat home. That would be nice, wouldn't it?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But we could work our way home over land and pick up some more cash. That would be better, wouldn't it?' Tomjon grinned. 'We took one hundred and three pence tonight; I counted heads during the Judgement speech. That's nearly one silver piece after expenses.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You're your father's son, and no mistake,' said Hwel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Tomjon sat back and looked at himself in the mirror.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' he said, 'I thought I had better be.' </span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat didn't like cats and hated the idea of mousetraps. She'd always felt that it should be possible to come to some sort of arrangement with creatures like mice so that all available food was rationed in the best interest of all parties. This was a very humanitarian outlook, which is to say that it was not a view shared by mice, and therefore her moonlit kitchen was alive.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>When there was a knocking at the door the entire floor appeared to rush towards the walls.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>After a few seconds the knocking came again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was another pause. Then the knocking rattled the door on its hinges, and a voice cried, 'Open in the name of the king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>A second voice said, in hurt tones, 'You don't have to shout like that. Why did you shout like that? I didn't order you to shout like that. It's enough to frighten anybody, shouting like that.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry, sire! It goes with the job, sire!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just knock again. A bit more gently, please.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The knocking might have been a bit softer. Magrat's apron dropped off its hook on the back of the door.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Are you sure I can't do it myself?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's not done, sire, kings knocking at humble cottage doors. Best leave it to me. OPEN IN THE—'</span>

        <span>'Don't like the sound of that, sire,' said the invisible sergeant. 'Could be dangerous. If you want my advice, sire, I'd set fire to the thatch.'</span>

        <span>There was the sound of a horse trotting away. A few seconds later the latch clonked and the Fool crept in.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It takes considerable courage to enter a witch's kitchen in the dark, but probably no more than it takes to wear a purple shirt with velvet sleeves and scalloped edges. It had this in its favour, though. There were no bells on it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He had brought a bottle of sparkling wine and a bouquet of flowers, both of which had gone flat during the journey. He laid them on the table, and sat down by the embers of the fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>He rubbed his eyes. It had been a long day. He wasn't, he felt, a good king, but he'd had a lifetime of working hard at being something he wasn't cut out to be, and he was persevering. As far as he could see, none of his predecessors had tried at all. So much to do, so much to repair, so much to organise . . .</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On top of it all there was the problem with the duchess. Somehow he'd felt moved to put her in a decent cell in an airy tower. She was a widow, after all. He felt he ought to be kind to widows. But being kind to the duchess didn't seem to achieve much, she didn't understand it, she thought it was just weakness. He was dreadfully afraid that he might have to have her head cut off.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>No, being a king was no laughing matter. He brightened up at the thought. There was that to be said about it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And, after a while, he fell asleep.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The duchess was not asleep. She was currently halfway down the castle wall on a rope of knotted sheets, having spent the previous day gradually chipping away the mortar around the bars of her window although, in truth, you could hack your way out of the average Lancre Castle wall with a piece of cheese. The fool! He'd given her cutlery, and plenty of bedclothes! That was how these people reacted. They let their fear do their thinking for them. They were scared of her, even when they thought they had her in their power (and the weak never had the strong in their power, never truly in their power). If she'd thrown herself in prison, she would have found considerable satisfaction in making herself regret she'd ever been born. But they'd just given her blankets, and worried about her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Well, she'd be back. There was a big world out there, and she knew how to pull the levers that made people do what she wanted. She wouldn't burden herself with a husband this time, either. Weak! He was the worst of them, no courage in him to be as bad as he knew he was, inside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She landed heavily on the moss, paused to catch her breath and then, with the knife ready in her hand, slipped away along the castle walls and into the forest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She'd go all the way down to the far border and swim the river there, or maybe build a raft. By morning she'd be too far away for them ever to find her, and she doubted very much that they'd ever come looking.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Weak!</span>

        <span>She moved through the forest with surprising speed. There were tracks, after all, wide enough for carts, and she had a pretty good sense of direction. Besides, all she needed to do was go downhill. If she found the gorge then she just had to follow the flow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>And then there seemed to be too many trees. There was still a track, and it went more or less in the right direction, but the trees on either side of it were planted rather more thickly than one might expect and, when she tried to turn back, there was no track at all behind her. She took to turning suddenly, half expecting to see the trees moving, but they were always standing stoically and firmly rooted in the moss.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>She couldn't feel a wind, but there was a sighing in the treetops.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'All right,' she said, under her breath. 'All right. I'm going anyway. I <em class="calibre10">want</em> to go. But I will be back.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>It was at this point that the track opened out into a clearing that hadn't been there the day before and wouldn't be there tomorrow, a clearing in which the moonlight glittered off assembled antlers and fangs and serried ranks of glowing eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The weak banded together can be pretty despicable, but it dawned on the duchess that an alliance of the strong can be more of an immediate problem.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was total silence for a few seconds, broken only by a faint panting, and then the duchess grinned, raised her knife, and charged the lot of them.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The front ranks of the massed creatures opened to let her pass, and then closed in again. Even the rabbits.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The kingdom exhaled.</span>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>On the moors under the very shadow of the peaks the mighty nocturnal chorus of nature had fallen silent. The crickets had ceased their chirping, the owls had hooted themselves into silence, and the wolves had other matters to attend to.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>There was a song that echoed and boomed from cliff to cliff, and resounded up the high hidden valleys, causing miniature avalanches. It funnelled along the secret tunnels under glaciers, losing all meaning as it rang between the walls of ice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>To find out what was actually being sung you would have to go all the way back down to the dying fire by the standing stone, where the cross-resonances and waves of conflicting echoes focused on a small, elderly woman who was waving an empty bottle.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—with a snail if you slow to a crawl, but the hedgehog—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It tastes better at the bottom of the bottle, doesn't it,' Magrat said, trying to drown out the chorus.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right,' said Granny, draining her cup.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Is there any more?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think Gytha finished it, by the sound of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They sat on the fragrant heather and stared up at the moon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, we've got a king,' said Granny. 'And there's an end of it.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It's thanks to you and Nanny, really,' said Magrat, and hiccupped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Why?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'None of them would have believed me if you hadn't spoken up.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Only because we was asked,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes, but everyone knows witches don't lie, that's the important thing. I mean, everyone could see they <em class="calibre10">looked</em> so alike, but that could have been coincidence. You see,' Magrat blushed, 'I looked up <em class="calibre10">droit de seigneur.</em> Goodie Whemper had a dictionary.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Nanny Ogg stopped singing.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes,' said Granny Weatherwax. 'Well.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat became aware of an uncomfortable atmosphere.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'You did tell the truth, didn't you?' she said. 'They really are brothers, aren't they?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh yes,' said Gytha Ogg. 'Definitely. I saw to his mother when your – when the new king was born. And to the queen when young Tomjon was born, and she told me who his father was.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Gytha!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Sorry.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The wine was going to her head, but the wheels in Magrat's mind still managed to turn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just a minute,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I remember the Fool's father,' said Nanny Ogg, speaking slowly and deliberately. 'Very personable young man, he was. He didn't get on with his dad, you know, but he used to visit sometimes. To see old friends.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He made friends easily,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Among the ladies,' agreed Nanny. 'Very athletic, wasn't he? Could climb walls like nobody's business, I remember hearing.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He was very popular at court,' said Granny. 'I know that much.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Oh, yes. With the queen, at any rate.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'The king used to go out hunting such a lot,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'It was that droit of his,' said Nanny. 'Always out and about with it, he was. Hardly ever home o'nights.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Just a minute,' Magrat repeated.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They looked at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Yes?' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre10">
          <span>'You</span>
        </em>
        <span> told everyone they were brothers and that Verence was the older!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's right.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you let everyone believe that—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny Weatherwax pulled her shawl around her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'We're bound to be truthful,' she said. 'But there's no call to be honest.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No, no, what you're saying is that the King of Lancre isn't really—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'What I'm saying <em class="calibre10">is,'</em> said Granny firmly, 'that we've got a king who is no worse than most and better than many and who's got his head screwed on right—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Even if it is against the thread,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'—and the old king's ghost has been laid to rest happy, there's been an enjoyable coronation and <em class="calibre10">some</em> of us got mugs we weren't entitled to, them being only for the kiddies and, all in all, things are a lot more satisfactory than they might be. That's what I'm saying. Never mind what should be or what might be or what ought to be. It's what things are that's important.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But he's not really a king!'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'He might be,' said Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'But you just said—'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Who knows? The late queen wasn't very good at counting. Anyway, he doesn't know he isn't royalty.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'And you're not going to tell him, are you?' said Granny Weatherwax.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat stared at the moon, which had a few clouds across it.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'No,' she said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Right, then,' said Granny. 'Anyway, look at it like this. Royalty has to start somewhere. It might as well start with him. It looks as though he means to take it seriously, which is a lot further than most of them take it. He'll do.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Magrat knew she had lost. You always lost against Granny Weatherwax, the only interest was in seeing exactly how. 'But I'm surprised at the two of you, I really am,' she said. 'You're witches. That means you have to care about things like truth and tradition and destiny, don't you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's where you've been getting it all wrong,' said Granny, 'Destiny <em class="calibre10">is</em> important, see, but people go wrong when they think it controls them. It's the other way around.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Bugger destiny,' agreed Nanny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny glared at her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'After all, you never thought being a witch was going to be easy, did you?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm learning,' said Magrat. She looked across the moor, where a thin rind of dawn glowed on the horizon.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I think I'd better be off,' she said. 'It's getting early.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Me too,' said Nanny Ogg. 'Our Shirl frets if I'm not home when she comes to get my breakfast.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>Granny carefully scuffed over the remains of the fire.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'When shall we three meet again?' she said. 'Hmm?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>The witches looked at one another sheepishly.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I'm a bit busy next month,' said Nanny. 'Birthdays and such. Er. And the work has really been piling up with all this hurly-burly. You know. And there's all the ghosts to think about.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'I thought you sent them back to the castle,' said Granny.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Well, they didn't want to go,' said Nanny vaguely. 'To be honest, I've got used to them around the place. They're company of an evening. They hardly scream at all, now.'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'That's nice,' said Granny. 'What about you, Magrat?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'There always seems to be such a lot to do at this time of year, don't you find?' said Magrat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>'Quite,' said Granny Weatherwax, pleasantly. 'It's no good getting yourself tied down to appointments all the time, is it? Let's just leave the whole question open, shall we?'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <span>They nodded. And, as the new day wound across the landscape, each one busy with her own thoughts, each one a witch alone, they went home<a href="#note_23" title="There is a school of thought that says that witches and wizards can never go home.

For one thing, longer arms and prehensile toes made getting around the higher shelves a whole lot easier, and being an ape meant you didn't have to bother with all this angst business. He had also been rather pleased to find that his new body, although looking deceptively like a rubber sack full of water, gave him three times the strength and twice the reach of his old one.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Ankh-Morpork's enviable system of licensed criminals owes much to the current Patrician, Lord Vetinari. He reasoned that the only way to police a city of a million inhabitants was to recognise the various gangs and robber guilds, give them professional status, invite the leaders to large dinners, allow an acceptable level of street crime and then make the guild leaders responsible for enforcing it, on pain of being stripped of their new civic honours along with large areas of their skins. It worked. Criminals, it turned out, made a very good police force; unauthorised robbers soon found, for example, that instead of a night in the cells they could now expect an eternity at the bottom of the river.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">However, there was the problem of apportioning the crime statistics, and so there arose a complex system of annual budgeting, chits and allowances to see that a) the members could make a reasonable living and b) no citizen was robbed or assaulted more than an agreed number of times. Many foresighted citizens in fact arranged to get an acceptable minimum of theft, assault, etc, over at the beginning of the financial year, often in the privacy and comfort of their own homes, and thus be able to walk the streets quite safely for the rest of the year. It all ticked over extremely peacefully and efficiently, demonstrating once again that compared to the Patrician of Ankh, Machiavelli could not have run a whelk stall.</div>

    inheritance, and CoffeeScript doesn’t disappoint. You can inherit from
    another class by using the <code class="literal">extends</code>
    keyword. In the example below, <code class="literal">Parrot</code>
    extends from <code class="literal">Animal</code>, inheriting all of
    its instance properties, such as <code class="literal">alive()</code>:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  constructor: (@name) -&gt;

  alive: -&gt;
    false

class Parrot extends Animal
  constructor: -&gt;
    super("Parrot")

  dead: -&gt;
    not @alive()</pre><p class="calibre8">You’ll notice that in the example above, we’re using the <code class="literal">super()</code> keyword. Behind the scenes, this is
    translated into a function call on the class’s parent prototype, invoked
    in the current context. In this case, it’ll be <code class="literal">Parrot.__super__.constructor.call(this,
    "Parrot");</code>. In practice, this will have exactly the same effect
    as invoking <code class="literal">super</code> in Ruby or Python,
    invoking the overridden inherited function.</p><p class="calibre8">Unless you override the <code class="literal">constructor</code>, by default CoffeeScript will invoke
    the parent’s constructor when instances are created.</p><p class="calibre8">CoffeeScript uses prototypal inheritance to automatically inherit
    all of a class’s instance properties. This ensures that classes are
    dynamic; even if you add properties to a parent class after a child has
    been created, the property will still be propagated to all of its
    inherited children:</p><pre class="screen">class Animal
  constructor: (@name) -&gt;

class Parrot extends Animal

Animal::rip = true

parrot = new Parrot("Macaw")
alert("This parrot is no more") if parrot.rip</pre><p class="calibre8">It’s worth pointing out though that static properties are copied to
    subclasses, rather than inherited using prototype as instance properties
    are. This is due to implementation details with JavaScript’s prototypal
    architecture, and is a difficult problem to work around.</p></div></div>

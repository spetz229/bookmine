    <code class="literal">in</code> operator. For example:</p><pre class="screen">var object = {one: 1, two: 2}
for(var key in object) alert(key + " = " + object[key])</pre><p class="calibre8">However, as you’ve seen in the previous section, CoffeeScript has
    already reserved <code class="literal">in</code> for use with
    arrays. Instead, the operator has been renamed <code class="literal">of</code>, and can be used like thus:</p><pre class="screen">object = {one: 1, two: 2}
alert("#{key} = #{value}") for key, value of object</pre><p class="calibre8">As you can see, you can specify variables for both the property
    name, and its value, which is rather convenient.</p></div></div>

    not something supported natively by CoffeeScript, for the good reason that
    they can be trivially implemented yourself. For example, here’s two
    functions, <code class="literal">extend()</code> and <code class="literal">include()</code>, that’ll add class and instance
    properties respectively to a class:</p><pre class="screen">extend = (obj, mixin) -&gt;
  obj[name] = method for name, method of mixin        
  obj

include = (klass, mixin) -&gt;
  extend klass.prototype, mixin

# Usage
include Parrot,
  isDeceased: true

(new Parrot).isDeceased</pre><p class="calibre8">Mixins are a great pattern for sharing common logic between modules
    when inheritance is not suitable. The advantage of mixins is that you can
    include multiple ones, compared to inheritance where only one class can be
    inherited from.</p></div></div>

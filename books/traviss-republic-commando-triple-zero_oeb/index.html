<div class="calibre1"><h3 class="calibre2">Annotation</h3><div class="paragraph">Following the eruption of the bloody Clone Wars at the battle of Geonosis, both sides remain deadlocked in a stalemate that can be broken only by elite warrior teams like Omega Squad, clone commandos with terrifying combat skills and a lethal arsenal...</div>

<div class="paragraph">For Omega Squad, deployed deep behind enemy lines, it's the same old special ops grind: sabotage, espionage, ambush, and assassination. But when Omega Squad is rushed to Coruscant, the war's most dangerous new hotspot, the commandos discover they're not the only ones penetrating the heart of the enemy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A surge in Separatist attacks has been traced to a network of Sep terror cells in the Republic's capital, masterminded by a mole in Command Headquarters. To identify and destroy a Separatist spy and terror network in a city full of civilians will require special talents and skills. Not even the leadership of Jedi generals, along with the assistance of Delta squad and a certain notorious ARC trooper, can even the odds against the Republic Commandos. And while success may not bring victory in the Clone Wars, failure means certain defeat.</div>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Republic Commando covert insertion on Fest, Atrivis sector, </strong><strong class="calibre11">Outer Rim, ten months after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Private journal of RC-8015, “Fi”</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">You have to see the funny side of things in the army. I think they have a real sense of humor in Defense Procurement, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So,” I ask. “How long ago did you put in a request for <em class="calibre6">black</em> stealth armor?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Seven standard months,” says Darman, staring out the gunship's crew bay onto an unbroken plain of snow. <em class="calibre6">White</em> snow. The freezing wind is whipping flurries of it into the open bay. “When we got back from Qiilura.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And <em class="calibre6">now</em> they issue it to us? To do a raid on <em class="calibre6">Fest?</em> The whole planet's covered in snow from pole to pole.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">I can hear the gunship pilot laughing over the comlink circuit. He can't resist it. “Want to borrow <em class="calibre6">my</em> armor? It's nice and white.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, they've deployed us in black Katarn armor. It'll take a direct hit from laser cannon to put a dent in us, but it would be nice to have the comfort of camouflage when we hit the ground.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even Atin's laughing. But Niner, who tries to take the place of Sergeant Kal and reassure us it's all going to be okay, is <em class="calibre6">not.</em> He's worried that we've run out of luck for this mission.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And so am I. Republic Commando losses in the first year of the war are running at 50 percent. Today we have to infiltrate a Separatist factory developing some new supermetal called phrik—whatever that is—and carry out a little asset denial, known in the trade as blowing stuff up. It's not a complicated mission: avoid droids, get in, lay charges in the processing plant and the foundry, avoid droids, get out. And then press the detonator.</div>

<div class="paragraph">One of Captain Ordo's Null ARC trooper brothers found this place: Clone Intelligence Units, they call them. I must write to thank the <em class="calibre6">di'kut</em> sometime.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So I try to keep the squad laughing, because it takes our minds off calculating the odds.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay,” I say. “What do we all want most right now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Roba steak,” says the pilot.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“White-clad camo,” says Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A really thick slice of uj cake,” says Atin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman pauses for a moment. “To see an old friend again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Me? I'd like to go back to Arca Company Barracks on Coruscant. I want to see Coruscant before I die, and so far I've seen next to nothing of the place. Someone promised to buy me a beer there once.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The pilot is skimming a couple of meters above the snow, taking us through a narrow pass to avoid detection. It's all mountains and ravines now. And snow.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've got visual on the factory,” the pilot says. “And you're not going to like it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why?” Niner asks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because there're an awful lot of battle droids out there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are they made of phrik?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't think so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No problem, then,” says Niner. “Let's spoil their entire day.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The gunship slows enough for us to jump clear, and we scramble through knee-deep snow to take up a position in the lee of an outcrop. There's nothing like a quick hello from a Plex rocket launcher to show droids who's boss. No, they're <em class="calibre6">definitely</em> not made from phrik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">I reload the Plex and keep turning the droids into shrapnel while Darman and Atin make their way to higher ground to reach the factory.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yeah, a nice beer on Coruscant, on Triple Zero. Dreams like that keep you going.</div>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Find Skirata. He's the only one who can talk these men down. And no, I'm not going to obliterate a whole barracks block just to neutralize six ARCs. So get me Skirata: he can't have traveled very far.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–General Iri Camas, Director of Special Forces, to Coruscant Security Force, from Siege Incident Control, Special Operations Brigade HQ Barracks, Coruscant, five days after the Battle of Geonosis</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Tipoca City, Kamino, eight years before Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Kal Skirata had committed the biggest mistake of his life, and he'd made some pretty big ones in his time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Kamino was damp. And damp didn't help his shattered ankle one little bit. No, it was <em class="calibre6">more</em> than damp: it was nothing but storm-whipped sea from pole to pole, and he wished that he'd worked that out before he responded to Jango Fetes offer of a lucrative long-term deployment in a location that his old comrade hadn't exactly specified.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But that was the least of his worries now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The air smelled more like a hospital than a military base. The place didn't look like barracks, either. Skirata leaned on the polished rail that was all that separated him from a forty-meter fall into a chamber large enough to swallow a battle cruiser and lose it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Above him, the vaulted illuminated ceiling stretched as far as the abyss did below. The prospect of the fall didn’t worry him half as much as not understanding what he was now seeing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The cavern—surgically clean, polished durasteel and permaglass—was filled with structures that seemed almost like fractals. At first glance they looked like giant toroids stacked on pillars; then, as he stared, the toroids resolved into smaller rings of permaglass containers, with containers within them, and inside those</div>

<div class="paragraph">No, this <em class="calibre6">wasn't happening</em>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Inside the transparent tubes there was fluid, and within it there was <em class="calibre6">movement</em>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It took him several minutes of staring and refocusing on one of the tubes to realize there was a body in there, and it was alive. In fact, there was a body in <em class="calibre6">every</em> tube: row upon row of tiny bodies, <em class="calibre6">children's</em> bodies. <em class="calibre6">Babies.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” he said aloud.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He thought he'd come to this Force-forsaken hole to train commandos. Now he knew he'd stepped into a nightmare. He heard boots behind him on the walkway of the gantry and turned sharply to see Jango coming slowly toward him, chin lowered as if in reproach.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you're thinking of leaving, Kal, you knew the deal,” said Jango, and leaned on the rail beside him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You said—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I said you'd be training special forces troops, and you will be. They just happen to be growing them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“What?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clones.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How the fierfek did you ever get involved with <em class="calibre6">that</em>?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A straight five million and a few extras for donating my genes. And don't look shocked. You'd have done the same.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The pieces fell into place for Skirata and he let himself be shocked anyway. War was one thing. Weird science was another issue entirely.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I'm keeping my end of the deal?” Skirata adjusted the fifteen-centimeter, three-sided blade that he always kept sheathed in his jacket sleeve. Two Kaminoan technicians walked serenely across the floor of the facility beneath him. Nobody had searched him and he felt better for having a few weapons located for easy use, including the small hold-out blaster tucked in the cuff of his boot.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And all those little kids in tanks …</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The Kaminoans disappeared from sight. “What do those things want with an army anyway?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“They</em> don't. And <em class="calibre6">you</em> don't need to know all this right now.” Jango beckoned him to follow. “Besides, you're already dead, remember?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Feels like it,” said Skirata. He was the <em class="calibre6">Cuy'val Dar—</em>literally, “those who no longer exist,” a hundred expert soldiers with a dozen specialties who'd answered Jango's secret summons in exchange for a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> of credits … as long as they were prepared to disappear from the galaxy <em class="calibre6">completely.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He trailed Jango down corridors of unbroken white duraplast, passing the occasional Kaminoan with its long gray neck and snake-like head. He'd been here for four standard days now, staring out the window of his quarters onto the endless ocean and catching an occasional glimpse of the aiwhas soaring up out of the waves and flapping into the air. The thunder was totally silenced by the soundproofing, but the lightning had become an annoyingly irregular pulse in the corner of his eye.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata knew from day one that he wouldn't like Kaminoans.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Their cold yellow eyes troubled him, and he didn't care for their arrogance, either. They stared at his limping gait and asked if he minded being <em class="calibre6">defective.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The window-lined corridor seemed to run the length of the city. Outside, it was hard to see where the horizon ended and the rain clouds began.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango looked back to see if he was keeping up. “Don't worry, Kal. I'm told it's clear weather in the summer—for a few days:”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Right.</em> The dreariest planet in the galaxy, and he was stuck on it. And his ankle was playing up. He really should have invested in getting it fixed surgically. When—if—he got out of here, he'd have the assets to get the best surgeon that credits could buy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango slowed down tactfully. “So, Ilippi threw you out?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah.” His wife wasn't Mandalorian. He'd hoped she would embrace the culture, but she didn't: she always hated seeing her old man go off to someone else's war. The fights began when he wanted to take their two sons into battle with him. They were eight years old, old enough to start learning their trade; but she refused, and soon Ilippi and the boys and his daughter were no longer waiting when he returned from the latest war. Ilippi divorced him the <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> way, same as they'd married, on a brief, solemn, private vow. A contract was a contract, written or not. “Just as well I've got another assignment to occupy me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You should have married a <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> girl. <em class="calibre6">Aruetiise</em> don't understand a mercenary's life.” Jango paused as if waiting for argument, but Kal wasn't giving him one. “Don't your <em class="calibre6">sons</em> talk to you any longer?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not often.” <em class="calibre6">So I failed as a father. Don't rub it in.</em> “Obviously they don't share the <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> outlook on life any more than their mother does.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, they won't be speaking to you at all now. Not here. Ever.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Nobody seemed to care if he had disappeared anyway. Yes, he <em class="calibre6">was</em> as good as dead. Jango said nothing more, and they walked in silence until they reached a large circular lobby with rooms leading off it like the spokes of a wheel.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ko Sai said something wasn't quite right with the first test batch of clones,” said Jango, ushering Skirata ahead of him into another room. “They've tested them and they don't think these are going to make the grade. I told Orun Wa that we'd give him the benefit of our military experience and take a look.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was used to evaluating fighting men—and women, come to that. He knew what it took to make a soldier. He was good at it; soldiering was his life, as it was for all <em class="calibre6">Mando'-ade</em>, allsons and daughters of Mandalore. At least there'd be some familiarity to cling to in this ocean wilderness.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was just a matter of staying as far from the Kaminoans as he could.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen,” said Orun Wa in his soothing monotone. He welcomed them into his office with a graceful tilt of the head, and Skirata noted that he had a prominent bony fin running across the top of his skull from front to back. Maybe that meant Orun Wa was older, or dominant, or something: he didn't look like the other examples of aiwha-bait that Skirata had seen so far. “I always believe in being honest about setbacks in a program. We value the Jedi Council as a customer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> to do with the Jedi,” said Jango. “I'm only a consultant on military matters.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Oh,</em> Skirata thought. <em class="calibre6">Jedi. Great.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I would still be happier if you confirmed that the first batch of units is below the acceptable standard.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bring them in, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata shoved his hands in his jacket pockets and wondered what he was going to see: poor marksmanship, poor endurance, lack of aggression? Not if these were Jango's clones. He was curious to see how the Kaminoans could have fouled up producing fighting men based on <em class="calibre6">that</em> template.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The storm raged against the transparisteel window, rain pounding in surges and then easing again. Orun Wa stood back with a graceful sweep of his arms like a dancer. And the doors opened.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Six identical little boys—four, maybe five years old—walked into the room.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was not a man who easily fell prey to sentimentality. But this did the job just fine.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were <em class="calibre6">children:</em> not soldiers, not droids, and not units. <em class="calibre6">Just little kids.</em> They had curly black hair and were all dressed in identical dark blue tunics and pants. He was expecting grown men. And that would have been bad enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He heard Jango inhale sharply.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The boys huddled together, and it ripped at Skirata's heart in a way he wasn't expecting. Two of the kids clutched each other, looking up at him with huge, dark, unblinking eyes: another moved slowly to the front of the tight pack as if barring Orun Wa's path and shielding the others.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Oh, he <em class="calibre6">was.</em> He was defending his brothers. Skirata was devastated.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“These units are defective, and I admit that we perhaps made an error in attempting to <em class="calibre6">enhance</em> the genetic template,” Orun Wa said, utterly unmoved by their vulnerability.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had worked out fast that Kaminoans despised everything that didn't fit their intolerant, arrogant society's ideal of perfection. So … they thought Jango's genome wasn't the perfect model for a soldier without a little adjustment, then. Maybe it was his solitary nature; he'd make a rotten infantry soldier. Jango wasn't a team player.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And maybe they didn't know that it was often imperfection that gave humans an edge.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The kids' gaze darted between Skirata and Jango, and the doorway, and all around the room, as if they were checking for an escape or appealing for help.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Chief Scientist Ko Sai apologizes, as do I,” said Orun Wa. “Six units did not survive incubation, but these developed normally and appeared to meet specifications, so they have undergone some flash-instruction and trials. Unfortunately, psychological testing indicates that they are simply too unreliable and fail to meet the personality profile required!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Which is?” said Jango.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That they can carry out orders:' Orun Wa blinked rapidly: he seemed embarrassed by error. “I can assure you that we <em class="calibre6">will</em> address these problems in the current Alpha production run. These units will be reconditioned, of course. Is there anything you wish to ask?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah,” said Skirata. “What do you mean by <em class="calibre6">reconditioned?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“In this case, <em class="calibre6">terminated.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a long silence in the bland, peaceful, white-walled room. Evil was supposed to be black, jet black; and it wasn't supposed to be soft-spoken. Then Skirata registered <em class="calibre6">terminated</em> and his instinct reacted before his brain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">His clenched fist was pressed against Orun Wa's chest in a second and the vile unfeeling thing jerked his head backward.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You touch one of those kids, you gray freak, and I'll skin you alive and feed you to the aiwhas—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Steady,” Jango said. He grabbed Skirata's arm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Orun Wa stood blinking at Skirata with those awful reptilian yellow eyes. “This is uncalled for. We care only about our customers' satisfaction.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata could hear his pulse pounding in his head and all <em class="calibre6">he</em> could care about was ripping Orun Wa apart. Killing someone in combat was one thing, but there was no honor in destroying unarmed kids. He yanked his arm out of Jango's grip and stepped back in front of the children. They were utterly silent. He dared not look at them. He fixed on Orun Wa.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango gripped his shoulder and squeezed hard enough to hurt. <em class="calibre6">Don't. Leave this to me.</em> It was his warning gesture. But Skirata was too angry and disgusted to fear Jango's wrath.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We could do with a few wild cards,” Jango said carefully, moving between Skirata and the Kaminoan. “It's good to have some surprises up your sleeve for the enemy. What are these kids really like? And how old are they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nearly two standard years' growth. Highly intelligent, deviant, disturbed—and uncommandable.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Could be ideal for intel work.” It was pure bluff: Skirata could see the little twitch of muscle in Jango's jaw. He was shocked, too. The bounty hunter couldn't hide <em class="calibre6">that</em> from his old associate. “I say we keep 'em?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Two?</em> The boys looked older. Skirata half turned to check on them, and their gazes were locked on him: it was almost an accusation. He glanced away, but took a step backward and put his hand discreetly behind him to place his palm on the head of the boy defending his brothers, just as a helpless gesture of comfort.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But a small hand closed tightly around his fingers instead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata swallowed hard. <em class="calibre6">Two years old.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can train them,” he said. “What are their names?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“These units are <em class="calibre6">numbered.</em> And I must emphasize that they're unresponsive to command.” Orun Wa persisted as if talking to a particularly stupid Weequay. “Our quality control designated them Null class and wishes to start—”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Null?</em> As in no <em class="calibre6">di'kutla</em> use?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango took a discreet but audible breath. “Leave this to me, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, they're not <em class="calibre6">units.”</em> The little hand was grasping his for dear life. He reached back with his other hand and another boy pressed up against his leg, clinging to him. It was pitiful. “And <em class="calibre6">I can train them.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Unwise,” said Orun Wa.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Kaminoan took a gliding step forward. They were such graceful creatures, but they were loathsome at a level that Skirata could simply not comprehend.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then the little lad grasping his leg suddenly snatched the hold-out blaster from Skirata's boot. Before he could react the kid had tossed it to the one who'd been clinging to his hand in apparent terror.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The boy caught it cleanly and aimed it two-handed at Orun Wa's chest.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek.” Jango sighed. “Put it down, kid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">But the lad wasn't about to stand down. He stood right in front of Skirata, utterly calm, blaster raised at the perfect angle, fingers placed just so with the left hand steadying the right, totally focused. And <em class="calibre6">deadly</em> serious.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata felt his jaw drop a good centimeter. Jango froze, then chuckled.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I reckon that proves my point,” he said, but he still had his eyes fixed on the tiny assassin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The kid clicked the safety catch. He seemed to be checking it was <em class="calibre6">off</em>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's okay, son,” Skirata said, as gently as he could. He didn't much care if the boy fried the Kaminoan, but he cared about the consequences for the kid. And he was instantly and totally <em class="calibre6">proud</em> of him—of all of them. “You don't need to shoot. I'm not going to let him touch <em class="calibre6">any</em> of you. Just give me back the blaster.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The child didn't budge; the blaster didn't waver. He should have been more concerned about cuddly toys than a clean shot at this stage in his young life. Skirata squatted down slowly behind him, trying not to spook him into firing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But if the boy had his back to him … then he <em class="calibre6">trusted</em> him, didn't he?</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Come on … just put it down, there's a good lad. Now give me the blaster.” He kept his voice as soft and level as he could, when he was actually torn between cheering and doing the job himself. “You're safe, I <em class="calibre6">promise</em> you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The boy paused, eyes and aim still both fixed on Orun Wa. “Yes sir.” Then he lowered the weapon to his side. Skirata put his hand on the boy's shoulder and pulled him back carefully.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good lad.” Skirata took the blaster from his little fingers and scooped him up in his arms. He dropped his voice to a whisper. “Nicely done, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Kaminoan showed no anger whatsoever, simply blinking, yellow, detached disappointment. “If that does not demonstrate their instability, then—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're coming with me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is not your decision.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, it's mine,” Jango interrupted. “And they've got the right stuff. Kal, get them out of here and I'll settle this with Orun Wa.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata limped toward the door, still making sure he was between the Kaminoan and the kids. He was halfway down the corridor with his bizarre escort of tiny deviants before the boy he was carrying wriggled uncomfortably in his arms.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can walk, sir,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was perfectly articulate, fluent—a little soldier way beyond his years.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata lowered him to the floor and the kids fell in behind him, oddly quiet and disciplined. They didn't strike him as dangerous or deviant, unless you counted stealing a weapon, pulling a feint, and almost shooting a Kaminoan as deviant. Skirata didn't.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The kids were just trying to survive, like any soldier had a duty to do.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And they looked four or five years old, but Orun Wa had definitely said they were two. Skirata suddenly wanted to ask them how long they'd spent in those awful suffocating transparisteel vats, cold hard tanks that were nothing like the dark comfort of a womb. It must have been like drowning. Could they see each other as they floated? Had they understood what was happening to them?</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reached the doors of his stark quarters and ushered them in, trying not to dwell on those thoughts.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The boys lined up against the wall automatically, hands clasped behind their backs, and waited without being told to.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I brought up two sons. How hard can it be to mind six kids for a few days?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata waited for them to react but they simply stared back at him as if expecting orders. He had none. Rain lashed the window that ran the whole width of the wall. Lightning flared. They all flinched.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But they still stood in silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell you what,” Skirata said, bewildered. He pointed to the couch. “You sit down over there and I'll get you something to eat. Okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They paused and then scrambled onto the couch, huddling together again. He found them so utterly disarming that he had to make a rapid exit to the kitchen area to gather his thoughts while he slapped uj cake onto a plate and sliced it roughly into six pieces. If this was how it was going to be for—for <em class="calibre6">years … .</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You're stuck, chum.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You took the credits.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And this is your whole world for the foreseeable future… and maybe forever.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It never stopped raining. And he was holed up with a species he loathed on sight, and who thought it was okay to dispose of units who happened to be living, talking, walking children. He raked his fingers through his hair and despaired, eyes closed, until he was suddenly aware of someone staring up at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sir?” the boy said. It was the courageous little marksman. He might have been identical to his brothers, but his mannerisms were distinctive. He had a habit of balling one fist at his side while the other hand was relaxed. “May we use the 'freshers?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata squatted down, face level with the kid's. “'Course you can.” It was quite pathetic: they were nothing like his own lively, boisterous sons had once been. “And I'm not <em class="calibre6">sir.</em> I'm not an officer. I'm a sergeant. You can call me <em class="calibre6">Sergeant</em> if you like, or you can call me <em class="calibre6">Kal.</em> Everyone else does.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes … Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's over there. Can you manage on your own?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know you don't have a name, but I really think you <em class="calibre6">should</em> have one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm Null Eleven. En-one-one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How'd you like to be called Ordo? He was a Mandalorian warrior.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are we Mandalorian warriors?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You bet.” The kid was a natural fighter. “In every sense of the word.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I like that name.” Little Ordo considered the white-tiled floor for a moment, as if assessing it for risk. “What's Mandalorian?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">For some reason that hurt most of all. If these kids didn't know their culture and what made someone a <em class="calibre6">Mando,</em> then they had no purpose, no pride, and nothing to hold them and their clan together when home wasn't a piece of land. If you were a nomad, your nation traveled in your heart. And without the <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> heart, you had nothing—not even your soul—in whatever new conquest followed death. Skirata knew at that moment what he had to do. He had to stop these boys from being <em class="calibre6">dar'manda,</em> eternal Dead Men, men without a <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> soul.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can see I need to teach you <em class="calibre6">a lot.”</em> Yes, this was his duty. “I'm Mandalorian, too. We're soldiers, nomads. You know what those words mean?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clever lad. Okay, you go and sort yourselves out in the 'freshers, and I want you all sitting back on the couch in ten minutes. Then we'll sort out names for everyone. Got it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So Kal Skirata—mercenary, assassin, and failed father—spent a stormy evening on Kamino sharing uj cake with six dangerously clever small boys who could already handle firearms and talk like adults, teaching them that they came from a warrior tradition, and that they had a language and a culture, and much to be proud of.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he explained that there was no Mandalorian word for “hero.” It was only <em class="calibre6">not</em> being one that had its own word: <em class="calibre6">Hut'uun.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There were an awful lot of <em class="calibre6">hut'uune</em> in the galaxy, and Skirata certainly counted the Kaminoans among them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The kids—now trying to get used to being Ordo, A'den, Kom'rk, Prudii, Mereel, and Jaing—sat devouring both their newfound heritage and the sticky sweet cake, eyes fixed on Skirata as he recited lists of Mandalorian words and they repeated them back to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He worked through the most common words, struggling. He had no idea how to teach a language to kids who could already speak fluent Basic. So he simply listed everything he could recall that seemed useful, and the little Null ARCs listened, grim-faced, flinching in unison at every blaze of lightning. After an hour Skirata felt that he was simply confusing some very frightened, very lonely children. They just <em class="calibre6">stared</em> at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, time to recap,” he said, exhausted by a bad day and the realization that there was an unknowable number of days like this stretching ahead. He pinched the bridge of his nose_ in an effort to focus. “Can you count from one to ten for me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Prudii—N-5—parted his lips to take a quick breath and suddenly all six spoke at once.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Solus, t'ad, ehn, cuir, rayshe'a, resol, e'tad, sh'ehn, she'cu, ta'raysh.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's gut flipped briefly and he sat stunned. These kids absorbed information like a sponge. <em class="calibre6">I only counted out the numbers for them once. Just once!</em> Their recall was perfect and absolute. He decided to be careful what he said to them in the future.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now that's <em class="calibre6">clever,”</em> he said. “You're very special lads, aren't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Orun Wa said we couldn't be measured,” Mereel said, totally without pride, and perched on the edge of the couch, swinging his legs almost like a normal four-year-old. They might have all looked identical, but their individual characters seemed distinct and … obvious. Skirata wasn't sure how he managed it, but he could now look at them and see that they were <em class="calibre6">different,</em> distinguished by small variations in facial expressions, gestures, frowns, and even tone of voice. Appearance wasn't everything.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You mean you scored too high for him to count?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel nodded gravely. Thunder slapped the platform city: Skirata felt it without hearing it. Mereel drew up his legs again and huddled tight up against his brothers in an instant.</div>

<div class="paragraph">No, Skirata didn't need a <em class="calibre6">hut'uunla</em> Kaminoan to tell him that these were extraordinary children. They could already handle a blaster, learn everything he threw at them, and understand the Kaminoans' intentions all too well: no wonder the aiwha-bait was scared of them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And they would be truly phenomenal soldiers—if only they could follow a few orders. He'd work on that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Want some more uj?” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They all nodded enthusiastically in unison. It was a relief. At least that gave him a few minutes' respite from their unrelenting, silent attention. They ate, still miniature adults. There was no chattering or high spirits.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And they flinched at every bolt of lightning.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you scared?” asked Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Kal,” said Ordo. “Is that wrong?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, son. Not at all.” It was as good a time to teach them as any. No lesson would <em class="calibre6">ever</em> be wasted on them. “Being afraid is okay. It's your body's way of getting you ready to defend yourself, and all you have to do is use it and not let it use you. Do you understand that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, think about being scared. What's it like?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo defocused slightly as if he were looking at something on a HUD he didn't have. “Cold.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Cold?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">A'den and Kom'rk chimed in. “And spiky.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay … okay.” Skirata tried to imagine what they meant. <em class="calibre6">Ah.</em> They were describing the feeling of adrenaline flooding their bodies. “That's fine. You just have to remember that it's your alarm system, and you need to take notice of it.” They were the same age as city kids on Coruscant who struggled to scrawl crude letters on flimsi. And here he was, teaching them battle psychology. His mouth felt oddly dry. “So you tell yourself, okay, I can handle this. My body's now ready to run faster and fight harder, and I'll be seeing and hearing only the most important things I need to know to <em class="calibre6">stay alive.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo went from his wide-eyed dark stare to slight defocus again for a moment and nodded. Skirata glanced at the others. They had that same disturbing concentration. They had also stacked their plates neatly on the low side table. He hadn't even noticed them doing it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Try thinking about your fear next time there's lightning,” Kal said. “Use it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He went back to the kitchen area and rummaged through the cupboards for some other snack to keep them going, because they seemed ravenous. As he stepped back into the main room with a white tray of sliced food-board that looked even less appetizing than the tray itself, someone buzzed at the door.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Nulls immediately went into a defensive pattern. Ordo and Jaing flanked the door, backs hard against the wall, and the other four took cover behind the sparse furniture. Skirata wondered for a second what flash-learning program had taught them that—or at least he <em class="calibre6">hoped</em> it was flash-taught. He waved them away from the door. They hesitated for a moment until he took out his Verpine shatter gun; then they appeared satisfied that he had the situation under some sort of control.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You scare me,” Skirata said softly. “Now stand back. If anyone's after you, they've got to come through <em class="calibre6">me</em> first, and I'm not about to let that happen.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even so, their reaction prompted him to stand to one side as he hit the panel to open the doors. Jango Fett was standing in the corridor outside, a small sleepy child in his arms. The boy's curly head rested on his shoulder. He looked younger than the Nulls, but it was the same face, the same hair, the same little hand clutching the fabric of Jango's tunic.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Another one?” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango glanced at the Verp. “You're getting edgy, aren't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kaminoans don't improve my mood. Want me to take him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He shoved the shatter gun in his belt and held out his arms to take the boy. Jango frowned slightly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is my <em class="calibre6">son,</em> Boba,” he said. He pulled his head back to gaze fondly at the dozing child's face. This wasn't the Jango that Skirata knew of old; he was pure paternal indulgence now. “Just trying to settle him down. Are you sorted now? I've told Orun Wa to stay away from you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're fine,” Skirata said. He wondered how he was going to ask the question, and decided blurting it out was probably as good a way as any. “Boba looks just like them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He would. He's been cloned from me, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh. <em class="calibre6">Oh.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“He was my price. Worth more to me than the credits.” Boba stirred, and Jango carefully adjusted his hold on the kid. “I'll be back in a month. Orun Wa says he'll have some commando candidates ready for us to take a look at as well as the rest of the Alpha batch. But he says he's made them a bit more … reliable.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had more questions than seemed prudent under the circumstances. It was natural for a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad</em> to want an heir above all else, and adoption was common, so cloning was … not <em class="calibre6">that</em> much different. But he had to ask one thing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why do these kids look older?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jango compressed his lips into a thin line of disapproval. “They accelerate the aging process.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, fierfek.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll have a company of a hundred and four commandos eventually, and they should be less trouble than the Nulls.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fine.” Did he get help? Were there Kaminoan minders to tackle the routine jobs, like feeding them? And how would the non-Mandalorian training sergeants deal with them? His stomach churned. He put on a brave face. “I can handle that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, and I'll be doing my bit, too. I have to train a hundred.” Jango glanced at the Nulls, now watching warily from the couch, and began walking away. “I just hope they aren't like <em class="calibre6">I</em> was at that age.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata pushed the controls, and the door sighed shut. “Okay, lads, bedtime,” he said. He dragged the cushions off the couch and laid them out on the floor, covering them with an assortment of blankets. The boys gave him a hand, with a grim sense of adult purpose that he knew would haunt him for the rest of his days. “We'll get you sorted out with decent quarters tomorrow, okay? Real beds:”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had the feeling they would have slept outside on the rain-lashed landing pad if he'd asked them to. They didn't seem at all unmanageable. He sat down in the chair and put his feet up on a stool. The Kaminoans had done their best to provide human-suitable furniture, something that struck him as a rare concession given their general xenophobic arrogance. He left the lights on, dimmed, to soothe the Nulls' fears.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They settled down, pulling the blankets over their heads completely. Skirata watched until they appeared to be asleep, laid his Verpine on the shelf beside the chair, and then closed his eyes to let the dreams overwhelm him. He woke with an explosive jerk of muscles a couple of times, a sure sign that he was past the point of tiredness and into exhaustion, and then he fell into an unending black well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He slept, or so he thought.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A warm weight pressed against him. His eyes jerked open and he remembered he was stranded on a perpetually overcast planet that didn't even seem to be on the star charts, where the local species thought killing human kids was merely quality control.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo's stricken little face looked up into his.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal…”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You scared, son?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Come on, then.” Skirata shifted position and Ordo scrambled up onto his lap, burying his face in his tunic as if he had never been held or comforted before. He hadn't, of course.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The storm was getting worse. “The lightning can't hurt you here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know, Kal.” Ordo's voice was muffled. He wouldn't look up. “But it's just like the bombs going off.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was going to ask him what he meant, but he knew in an instant that it would make him angry enough to do something stupid if he heard the answer. He hugged Ordo to him and felt the boy's heart pounding in terror.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was doing pretty well for a four-year-old soldier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They could learn to be heroes tomorrow. Tonight they needed to be children, reassured that the storm was not a battlefield, and so was nothing to fear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The lightning illuminated the room in brief, fierce white light: Ordo flinched again. Skirata laid his hand on the boy's head and ruffled his hair.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's okay, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika,”</em> he said softly. “I'm here, son. I'm here.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Eight years later: Special Forces SO Brigade HQ Barracks, </strong><strong class="calibre11">Coruscant, five days after the Battle of Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata had been detained by Coruscant Security Force officers and for once in his life he hadn't put up a fight.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Technically, he'd been <em class="calibre6">arrested.</em> And now he was the most relieved man in the galaxy, as well as the happiest. He jumped out of the police patrol speeder and winced at the sharp pain in his ankle as he hit the ground. He'd get that sorted out sooner or later, but now wasn't the time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Wow, take a look at <em class="calibre6">that,”</em> the pilot said. “They're holding off special ops squads there. You sure there's only six of 'em?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, six <em class="calibre6">is</em> overkill,” Skirata said, discreetly patting his pockets and sleeves to make sure the assorted tools of his trade were in place and ready for use. It was just habit. “But they're probably scared.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“They're</em> scared?” The pilot snorted. “Hey, you know Fett's dead? Windu topped him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know,” Skirata said, fighting the urge to ask if he also knew what had happened to little Boba. If the kid was still alive, he needed a dad. “Let's hope the Jedi don't have a problem with <em class="calibre6">all</em> of us <em class="calibre6">Mando'ade.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The pilot closed the hatch, and Skirata limped across the barracks landing pad. Jedi general Iri Camas, hands on hips with his brown robes flapping in the breeze, watched in a way that Skirata could only describe as <em class="calibre6">suspicious.</em> Two clone troopers waited with him. Skirata thought the Jedi should get his long white hair cut: it wasn't practical or becoming for a soldier to wear his hair to his shoulders.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you for responding, Sergeant,” Camas said. “And I apologize for the manner of your return. I realize your contract is completed now, so you owe us nothing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anytime,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He noted the blasterproof assault shields erected across the main entrance: four squads of Republic Commandos stood behind them, DC-17 rifles ready. He glanced up at the roof, and there were two commando sniper teams spread out along the parapet as well. Yes, if a bunch of Null-class Advance Recon Commandos didn't want to cooperate, then it would take a lot of equally hard men to persuade them otherwise. And he knew that none of the commandos would be happy about being ordered in to do the persuading. They were brothers, even if the ARCs were rather different men at heart.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata shoved his hands in his jacket pockets and focused on the doors. “So what started all this, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Camas shook his head. “They're scheduled to be chilled down now that they're back from Geonosis, because nobody can command them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know. Please, get them to stand down.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're even more of a handful than the regular Alpha-batch ARCs, aren't they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know that, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you wanted the hardest troops you could buy to take on the enemy, and then you got cold feet when they turned out to be too hard.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm a civilian at the moment, actually.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Camas took a silent breath. “Can you get them to surrender? They've shut down the whole barracks!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre6">can.”</em> Skirata wondered if the clone troopers were looking sideways at him, or in the direction they appeared to be facing. You could never tell with their helmets on. “But I won't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I really don't want any casualties. Are you holding out for an increased fee?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was a mercenary, but the suggestion insulted him. Camas couldn't be expected to know how he felt about his men, though. He made an effort not to be annoyed. “Enlist me in the Grand Army of the Republic and give me back my lads. Then we'll see.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're terrified of chill-down, that's all. You have to understand what happened to them as kids.” Camas gave him an odd look. “And don't even <em class="calibre6">think</em> about mind influence, General.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't give a mott's backside about pay. Eight years spent on Kamino training special forces for the Republic's clone army had made him wealthy, and if they wanted to press more credits on him, that was fine; he'd have a good use for them. But what he wanted most right then, and what had made him happy to return with the CSF officers instead of showing them just how handy he was with a fighting knife, was <em class="calibre6">not</em> being safe in a soft civilian life when his men were fighting a desperate, bloody war.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he <em class="calibre6">needed</em> to be back with them. He hadn't even had the chance to say good-bye when they suddenly shipped out to Geonosis. He'd lasted five miserable days without them, days without purpose, days without <em class="calibre6">family.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very well,” Camas said. “Special adviser status. I can authorize that, I suppose.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata couldn't see the commandos' faces behind their visors, but he knew they'd be watching him carefully. He recognized some of the paint schemes on their Katarn armor: Jez from Aiwha-3 Squad, and Stoker from Gamma, and Ram from Bravo up on the roof. Incomplete squads: high casualties on Geonosis, then. His heart sank.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He began walking forward. He got to the blaster shields, and Jez touched his glove to his helmet. “Nice to see you back so soon, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Couldn't stay away,” Skirata said. “You okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's a laugh a minute, this job.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Camas called out, “Sergeant? Sergeant! What if they open fire—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then they open fire!” Skirata reached the doors and turned his back on them for a few moments, unafraid. “Do we have a deal? Or do you want me holed up in there with them? Because I won't be coming out unless you guarantee them no disciplinary action.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It struck Skirata that Camas might be the one to fire on him right then. He wondered if his commandos would obey that order if it were given. He wouldn't have minded if they had. He'd taught them to do their job, regardless of their own feelings.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You have my word,” Camas said. “Consider yourself in the Grand Army. We'll discuss how we're going to deploy you and your men later. But first let's get everyone back to normal, shall we, please?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll hold you to every last word, General.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He waited at the doors for a few moments. The two sheets of reinforced durasteel parted slowly. He walked in, relieved, and home again at last.</div>

<div class="paragraph">No, Camas really needed to understand what had happened to these men as young boys. He had to, if he was going to cope with the war that had now been unleashed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wouldn't just be fought on someone else's planet. It would be fought in every corner of the galaxy, in every city, in every home. It was a war not just of territories, but of ideologies.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it was wholly outside Skirata's Mandalorian philosophy: but it was his war regardless, because his men were its instrument whether they liked it or not.</div>

<div class="paragraph">One day, he would give them back something the Kaminoans and the Republic had stolen from them. He swore it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Ord'ika!”</em> he called. “Ordo? You've been a naughty boy again, haven't you? Come here…”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">General Etain Tur-Mukan watched the HNE news feed with mixed feelings. On one hand the events at home saddened her: on the other, they reminded her what the war was about.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Fifteen soldiers and twelve civilian support staff are reported dead after today's second bomb blast, this time at a GAR logistics base. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but a security forces spokesman said today that the proximity to tomorrow's first anniversary of the Battle of Geonosis was significant. It brings the total number of deaths in apparent Separatist terror attacks this year to three thousand and forty. The Senate has pledged to smash their networks …”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Clone Commander Gett stood at her side, hands clasped behind his back as they waited on the repulsor platform that shunted ammo boxes from the magazine to the hangar deck.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No way to die,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain turned to look at the troops around them. “Neither is this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were set to go. <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> was half an hour out from Dinlo and the gunship pilots were making their way down the passage from the flight briefing to carry out their pre-sortie checks, yellow-trimmed helmets tucked under one arm. They all held the helmets exactly the same way, no doubt the result of thorough drill. General Etain Tur-Mukan noted that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She stood back from the hatch to let them through and got a salute from each as he passed. One glanced at the somewhat unconventional weapon slung across her shoulder and grinned. He indicated the huge LJ-50 concussion rifle that almost dwarfed her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does that thing light up blue, General?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only if you're on the receiving end, trooper,” she said, and gave him her most reassuring smile.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She knew they were afraid, because a commando called Darman had taught her that only idiots didn't fear combat. Fear was an asset, an incentive, a tool. She knew how to use it now, even if she didn't embrace it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Today she needed to tell Improcco Company that. They knew it already, but this was her first mission with them, and she had learned that a little openness with the troops went a long way. And she wanted them to know that she saw them for the human beings they were. Meeting Republic commandos on Qiilura for the first time had been a painful revelation for her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you okay with that, General?” Gett seemed to be able to guess what she was thinking almost all the time, and she wondered briefly if telepathy was in their genetic mix. Then she reminded herself that men who all looked the same learned to be very, very sensitive to tiny behavioral cues. “We've got a DC-15 if you prefer. Nice piece of kit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The LJ-50 was exhaustingly heavy. She'd developed her arm muscles in the last year, but it still took some handling.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Some very competent gentlemen taught me to use a conc rifle,” she said. “They persuaded me to keep my lightsaber for close-combat. Besides, the LJ's got a four-meter spread at a thirty-meter range. I'm a great believer in efficiency over style.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett smiled. He knew the stories about the Qiilura mission. They all did, it seemed. Gossip traveled at light speed in a closed community, and it'd had months to make the rounds. “I understand Omega are okay and on TIOPS in the Outer Rim right now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's kind of you to check for me, Commander.” She had to ask. “What's TIOPS?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Captain Ordo makes a point of giving your signals priority.” He lowered his voice. “Traffic interdiction operations. Boarding the bad guys' vessels.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you. I've never met Ordo, but he does seem to take care of me very well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One of Kal Skirata's Null ARCs.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, <em class="calibre6">Kal</em> again …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've never met him, have you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, but I hope I do. I feel as if he's been walking behind me for a long time.” She looked around the hangar and noted there was one platoon still missing. She'd wait. She needed them all to hear this. “I envy his ability to inspire people.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett said nothing. Tact, perhaps, or merely nothing to add; Etain feared that she still projected her own doubts onto others. She was a Jedi Knight now. She had passed her trials on Qiilura with Master Arligan Zey, working under deep cover with him to mobilize the colonists against the remnants of the Neimoidian and Trandoshan occupation. It was silent, grim, secret work, and even though a Republic garrison had now been established on the planet, she still felt that the dwindling population of native Gurlanins and the human farmers were set on a collision course. The Republic had promised the Gurlanins that they would remove the human colony from their world.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So far, they hadn't.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It would have been a simple case of broken promises—like many others in the galaxy's history—had the Gurlanins not been a race of shapeshifting predators, working as spies for the Republic. This was their bargain: they would provide their unique espionage skills if the farmers stopped driving away the prey on which Gurlanins depended. As far as the Gurlanins were concerned, that meant the removal of the human settlements on Qiilura.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain knew Gurlanins made bad enemies. They were more than capable of killing farmers, as they'd proved when they exacted revenge on informers on Qiilura. But the war came first, and diplomacy had to take a backseat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All present and correct now, General,” Gett said. He flicked the controls of the repulsor platform and it lifted them about a meter above the deck, so that the assembled company of 144 clone troopers could see and hear her clearly. There was no noise apart from the occasional clack of armor plates as one soldier brushed too close to another, or the quiet clearing of throats. They didn't chat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett still defaulted to drill. “Company—a … ten … <em class="calibre6">shun!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre6">chunkkk</em> of armor and rifles being slapped hard against chest plates was one synchronous noise. Etain waited a few moments and concentrated on projecting her voice across the cavern of the hangar. She hadn't been trained as an officer. It didn't come naturally.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They needed her to <em class="calibre6">be</em> one, though, just as Darman had when he had expected all Jedi to be competent commanders. She inhaled slowly and felt her voice lift from her stomach through her chest.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand easy,” she said. “And buckets off.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The clack and hiss of helmets being removed was a little more ragged than the snap to attention. They weren't expecting that. She stared down into identical faces, reaching out into the Force to get some sense of who they might be and their state of mind, much as she had with Omega. It was a complex tapestry, and yes, there <em class="calibre6">was</em> fear; there was an intense sense of belonging and focus, too. And there was not a trace of the hopeful child that had once so confused her when she <em class="calibre6">felt</em> Darman long before she saw him for the first time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Clones grew fast and learned even faster. A year at war—real war, not just fatally realistic training—had made them a lot more worldly-wise and less idealistic.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We have two battalions pinned down on Dinlo,” she said. “You've seen the op order. We open up that exit route for them by cutting through droid lines so they can reach the extraction point. You'll have air support, but we'll be relying predominantly on your infantry skills.” She paused. They listened politely. Whatever focus they had appeared to come not from her but from something inside them. “I'm not going to shoot you any line about glory, because this is about <em class="calibre6">survival.</em> That's my first rule as a Jedi, you know that? <em class="calibre6">Survive.</em> And so should it be yours. I don't want any wild sacrifices. I want to come out of this with as many of you and the Forty-first alive as possible—not because you're assets we need to use again, but because <em class="calibre6">I don't want you to die.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She felt the silence change, not in quality but in the realization that shivered almost imperceptibly through the Force. This wasn't how they were used to seeing themselves.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We weren't exactly queuing up for it ourselves, ma'am,” said a pilot, one boot on the step to his cockpit. There was a ripple of laughter, and Etain laughed, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll try to keep my arc of fire under control, then,” said Etain, and patted the Stouker. She glanced at Gett's forearm; he tilted it so that she could see his chrono readout. “Ramps down in twenty-four minutes. Dismissed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The men broke up, replacing their helmets and falling into platoons and squads to make an orderly path to their assigned craft. The squadron of LAAT/c gunships had been stripped out to create troop space on their cargo decks. Gett inspected the interior of his helmet, holding it in both gloved hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Aren't you supposed to wish that the Force be with them, General?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain liked Gett. He didn't treat her as an omniscient military genius but as just another being stuck in a hard place without a lot of choices. She could hear a faint sound coming from his helmet's audio feed; when she concentrated, she could hear singing, and so held out her hand for the helmet. She'd tried on Atin's once and been stunned by the welter of data it flung at the wearer. Helmet held close to her head, she could make out strong male voices, a choir of them, singing an anthem she had heard snatches of but rarely had the chance to listen to: “Vode An.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were singing, in the privacy of their own helmet comlinks, retreating into their world, like Omega Squad did from time to time. She could hear nothing outside the helmets, of course, and she felt oddly excluded. But they were not her <em class="calibre6">brothers all,</em> however much she wished to be part of something greater than herself, even more than the Jedi Order. They were gearing up for battle.</div>

<blockquote class="calibre12"><em class="calibre6">Bal kote, darasuum kote,</em><br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">Jorso'ran kando a tome</em> …<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></blockquote><div class="paragraph">It sounded less martial and more of a lament to her ears right then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She'd have to ask General Jusik for a translation. He was very much the <em class="calibre6">Mando'a</em> speaker these days.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She handed Gett his helmet back and gave him a nod of thanks. “It's not just the Force we need with us today, Commander,” she said. “It's reliable kit and accurate intel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Always is, General,” he said. “Always is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He slipped his helmet back on and sealed the collar.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She knew without asking that he had started singing, completely silent to her, but one voice with his brothers.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">* * *</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Captain Ordo needed General Bardan Jusik, and he needed him <em class="calibre6">fast.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He wasn't answering his comlink. That irked Ordo because an officer was supposed to be contactable at all times. And this was precisely the kind of emergency that proved the point.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo settled the two-seater Aratech speeder bike outside the main doors—far enough to one side not to obstruct them, as safety precautions dictated—and strode down the main passage that led to the briefing and ops rooms.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Location for General Jusik, please,” he said to the admin droid that was operating the comlink relays in the lobby area.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Meeting with General Arligan Zey and ARC Trooper Captain Maze in the CO's office, sir, discussing the incontinent ordnance situation—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” said Ordo. <em class="calibre6">Just say</em> bomb, <em class="calibre6">will you?</em> “That's why I'm here, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can't—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he could; and he did. “Noted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The red light above the office doors told Ordo that the general didn't want to be interrupted. He expected the Jedi's Force sensitivity to detect him coming and open those doors, but they remained closed, so Ordo simply made use of the list of five thousand security codes that he had memorized for an eventuality like this. He would never trust them to a datapad alone. Skirata had taught him that sometimes you could only take your own brain and body into battle.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took off his helmet first, a courtesy Skirata had also taught him, and tapped in the code on the side panel.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The doors parted and he walked up to the meeting table, a pool of dark blue polished stone where Zey, Jusik, and Zey's frankly surprised ARC captain sat staring at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Morning, sir,” said Ordo. “My apologies for interrupting, but I need General Jusik now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's thin pale face with its straggly blond beard was the picture of horrified embarrassment. Ordo thought all Jedi could sense him coming, but that never seemed to buffer their surprise when he arrived on urgent business.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik didn't move fast enough. Ordo made a gesture toward the door.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Captain, it's not customary to interrupt emergency meetings,” Zey said carefully. “General Jusik is our ordnance specialist and—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's why I need him now, sir. Sergeant Skirata sends his compliments, but he would like the general to join him at the incident scene, seeing as he's the explosives expert and his skills would be best spent on practical matters rather than discussion.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think your <em class="calibre6">sergeant</em> should be leaving all that to Coruscant Security,” said Captain Maze, who clearly didn't understand the situation well enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Typical ordinary ARC. Typical</em> stubborn <em class="calibre6">ARC.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“No,”</em> Ordo said. “Not possible. If I could hurry you a little, General Jusik, I have a speeder right outside. And please remember to leave your comlink active in the future. You <em class="calibre6">must</em> be contactable at all times.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Maze looked at Zey, and Zey shook his head discreetly. Ordo caught Jusik by his elbow and hurried him down the passage.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry about reprimanding you in front of Zey, sir,” Ordo said, scattering droids and the occasional clone trooper as they hurried back up the passageway. “But Sergeant Skirata is <em class="calibre6">livid.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know, I should have left it on—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like to pilot, sir? I know you enjoy it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes please—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the rapid thud of boots behind him that made Ordo stop and turn just as Captain Maze put his hand out to tap him on the shoulder. He deflected the ARC'S arm and brushed it aside.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Maze squared up. “Look, <em class="calibre6">Null,</em> I don't know who your sergeant thinks he is, but you <em class="calibre6">obey</em> a general when he—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't have time for this.” Ordo brought his fist up hard and without warning right under Maze's chin, knocking him against the wall. The man swore and didn't go down, so Ordo hit him again, this time in the nose—always demoralizing enough to stop someone dead, but nothing seriously damaging, nothing to cause <em class="calibre6">lasting</em> pain. He would never harm a brother if he could help it. “And I only take orders from Kal Skirata.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik and Ordo sprinted the rest of the way to the speeder to make up lost time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo, you just flattened an ARC trooper.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He was delaying us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you <em class="calibre6">hit</em> him. <em class="calibre6">Twice.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“No permanent harm done,” Ordo said, lifting his <em class="calibre6">kama</em> to slide over the pillion seat behind Jusik. He sealed his helmet. “You can't convince Alpha ARCs of anything by rational argument. They're every bit as obtuse and impulsive as Fett, believe me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik looked perplexed as he started up the drive. He took the speeder bike into a straight vertical lift and spun it around at the top of the climb. His hair, tied back in a bunch, whipped across Ordo's visor on the slipstream, and the ARC brushed it aside in irritated silence. It was high time the boy braided it or got it cut short.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where to, Ordo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Manarai.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Brief me,” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“CSF is struggling with this. If you get in right now and use the Force while the incident scene is fresh, we might get a break.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik banked right to avoid a slim spire and chewed his lower lip. He seemed to be able to fly without thinking. “I've been over the data six or seven times and I can't see <em class="calibre6">any</em> consistent pattern in any of the devices. Not the materials, not the method of construction, nothing. Just that they're all very complex devices, and hard to set.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo blinked to switch his helmet audio to filter out the wind noise. Next time, he'd commandeer an airspeeder with a canopy. “Always explosives.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Say again?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo adjusted his volume. “I said <em class="calibre6">always explosives.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Chemical and biological ordnance has limited use on a planet with more than a thousand different species. Things that go bang, though, are guaranteed to hurt <em class="calibre6">every</em> race.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd buy that if these devices were being used randomly. They're not. It's all Grand Army targets. Humans.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you sure it's me you need for this?” Jusik asked. “I'm not as adept with the living Force as others.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You want to go back and have a nice meeting?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No.” Jusik looked back over his shoulder with a big grin. Ordo had learned not to tell him to keep his eyes straight ahead, but it was still unnerving to watch a Jedi navigate a craft by his Force-senses alone. “I've never seen <em class="calibre6">anyone</em> walk over Zey like that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I simply had to get the job done, sir. No offense.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you mind my asking you something, Ordo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Go ahead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why do you tolerate me? You don't take the slightest notice of Zey. Or Camas. Or anyone else, for that matter.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Skirata respects you. I trust his judgment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.” Jusik didn't seem to be expecting that answer. “I—I have a very great regard for our sergeant, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo noted the word <em class="calibre6">our.</em> And <em class="calibre6">that</em> was what made Jusik different, as far as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir,</em> Papa Kal, was concerned: he had thrown in his lot with his men. But, as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> said privately, you could stick a Weequay officer in front of the clone army and they would still fight well. An army of three million men with very few Jedi officers had to be self-directing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was well used to directing himself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik never asked if Ordo thought of him as his commanding officer, though. He probably knew, and didn't need to be reminded that Ordo answered only to the one man who had stepped physically between him and death once, twice, more times than was decent to count: Kal Skirata. And while Ordo knew intellectually that a detached, unsentimental officer was the kind who won wars and saved the most lives, his heart said that a sergeant who was ready to die to protect his men got the very last drop of sweat and blood from them, and given gladly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think you might <em class="calibre6">really</em> be in trouble with Zey this time, Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And what do you think he's going to do about it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Aren't you afraid?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not since Kamino.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">If Jusik understood that, it didn't show. “Is it true that your brother Mereel hijacked a transport to Kamino?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's known as hardening targets, General. Challenging security to improve it. We do that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a lie, but not entirely: the Nulls tried not to remove GAR assets from the battlefield unless it was absolutely necessary, but in this case <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> had said it was. The Jedi command turned a blind eye to the irregularities if they detected them because the Null squad produced unparalleled results. No, Zey wouldn't touch him. If he was foolish enough to try, he would learn a hard lesson.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General, do you remember being taken from your parents?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik glanced to his left and a few moments later a CSF patrol appeared on their flank, dipped a wing in acknowledgment, and dropped away below them again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're just pinging us to be sure we are who they think we are,” the Jedi said, evading the question. “Can't trust anything to be what it seems these days.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Indeed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hope CSF aren't offended by our intervention.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo tightened his grip. “It's not their fault they can't handle this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're very competent.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're competent at <em class="calibre6">defense.</em> They're not used to attacking. We can think like an enemy better than they can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“You can.</em> I fear I never will.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was trained to kill and destroy by any means possible. I suspect you were trained to obey some rules.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I do actually.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What? Obey rules?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I remember being taken from my family. Just being <em class="calibre6">taken.</em> Not my family, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And what makes you so attached to <em class="calibre6">us?”</em> Ordo chose his words precisely, knowing what attachment meant to a Jedi. He knew the answer anyway. “And doesn't that worry you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik paused for a moment and then turned with an anxious smile. Jedi weren't supposed to feel powerful emotions like vengeance or love or hate. Ordo could now see that conflict on the boy's face daily.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And Jusik <em class="calibre6">was</em> a boy: Ordo was the same physical age as the general—twenty-two—but he felt a generation older, despite being <em class="calibre6">born</em> only eleven years ago. And the Jedi drew strength from the things that tore up his heart, just as Kal Skirata did.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He and Jusik were opposites in so many ways and yet so very similar in others.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You have such a passionate sense of <em class="calibre6">belonging,”</em> Jusik said at last. “And you never complain about the way you're used.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Save your sympathy for the troopers,” Ordo said. “Nobody uses <em class="calibre6">us.</em> And a clear sense of purpose is a strength.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The southern side of the logistics depot was a wasteland of shattered metal and rubble. From the air, it looked like an abandoned construction site with a brightly colored perimeter fence. As Jusik dropped lower, the perimeter resolved into crowds held back by a CSF cordon. The GAR supplies base was right on the boundary of a civilian area, separated only by a strip of landing platforms, with levels of warehousing operated by droids below it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It had obviously been a big device. Had the same bomb exploded in the civilian heart of Coruscant, the casualties would have run to thousands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whatever do they find to look at?” Jusik asked. He had trouble finding a space to set down and had to land outside the security cordon. He was clearly offended by the sightseers and didn't wait for Ordo to clear a path through the crowd for him. For a quietly spoken man, Jusik could certainly make himself heard. “Citizens, unless you have contributions to make here, can I suggest you clear the area in case there's a second device still set to detonate?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was impressed at the speed with which most of the crowd melted away. The resistantly curious hung around in small groups.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't want to see this,” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They paused, and then walked away. A CSF incident support vessel skimmed across the strip and hovered for a moment beside Jusik. The pilot leaned a little way out of the hatch. “Never seen mind influence in action before, sir. Thank you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't using the Force,” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo found a new reason to like this Jedi every day. He took the war as personally as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> did.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A thickset man in gray tunic waved to them from the inner cordon, where a large group of civilians and hovercams waited. Captain Jailer Obrim wasn't wearing his Senate Guard finery any longer. Ordo knew him well: since they'd worked together with Omega Squad on the spaceport siege, Obrim's time had been increasingly taken up with counterterrorism duties. He was seconded to CSF now, but they still didn't seem able to persuade him to wear the blue uniform.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can you influence the media to go away, General?” Ordo said. “Or shall I do it <em class="calibre6">manually?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The CSF forensics investigation team was still picking a slow and careful path through the debris of the entrance to Bravo Eight when Ordo and Jusik reached the cordon. Set back ten meters from the inner cordon was a screen of white plastoid sheet with the CSF badge repeated across its surface: the worst debris had been screened from the cams and prying eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was grim work for civilian police. Ordo knew that they had neither the expertise nor the numbers to handle what was happening lately. And how did they cope with the things they saw if they hadn't been trained to deal with them from childhood, as he had? For a moment he felt pity.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But there was work to do. Ordo flicked on the voice projection of his helmet with a quick eye movement. “Mind your backs, please.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">An HNE crew and a dozen other media representatives—some <em class="calibre6">wets,</em> as Skirata called organic life-forms, some <em class="calibre6">tinnies,</em> or droids—formed a cautious audience for the grisly aftermath of the explosion. They parted instantly, even before they looked around and saw Ordo striding toward them. Then they gave him an even wider berth. An ARC trooper cut an imposing figure, and a captain—marked in the brilliant scarlet that subconsciously said <em class="calibre6">danger</em> to many humanoid species—cleared a <em class="calibre6">big</em> path.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim deactivated a section of the cordon to let Jusik and Ordo pass.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is General Bardan Jusik,” Ordo said. “He's one of us. Can he wander around and assess the site?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim looked Jusik up and down with the air of a man who believed more in hard data than the Force. “Of course he can. Mind the evidence markers, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll be cautious,” Jusik said, meshing his fingers in front of him to do that little Jedi bow that Ordo found fascinating. Sometimes Jusik was one of the boys, and sometimes he was ancient, wisely sober, another creature entirely. “I won't contaminate evidence.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim waited for him to walk away and turned to Ordo. “Not that it'd matter. The forensic is getting us nowhere. Maybe we need the Mystic Mob to give us a break. How are you, anyway?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Focused. Very focused.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, your boss is pretty <em class="calibre6">focused,</em> too. He can curse the slime off a Hutt, that man.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He takes all casualties personally, I'm afraid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know what you mean. I'm sorry about your boys, by the way. They catch it coming and going, don't they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was bent deep in conversation with a CSF officer, their heads almost touching, talking in low and agitated voices. He swung around as Ordo approached. His face was gray with suppressed anger.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fifteen dead.” Skirata clearly didn't care about civilian casualties, traffic disruption, or structural damage. He gestured toward a large fragment of white leg armor in the rubble of what had been a security post. “I'm going to rip some <em class="calibre6">chakaar's</em> guts out for this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When we find them, I'll make sure you're first in line,” Obrim said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There wasn't a lot any of them could do at that moment except to allow the largely Sullustan scenes-of-crime team to do their work. Skirata, chewing vigorously on that bittersweet <em class="calibre6">ruik</em> root that he'd recently taken a liking to, stood with his fists in his jacket pockets, watching Jusik stepping delicately between chunks of debris. The Jedi occasionally stopped to close his eyes and stand completely motionless.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's expression was one of cold appraisal. “He's a good kid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo nodded. “Do you want me to look after him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, but not at the expense of your own safety.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">After a few minutes Jusik made his way back to the cordon, arms folded.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You didn't pick up anything?” Skirata said, 'as if he expected Jusik to bay like a hunting strill latching on to a scent.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A great deal.” Jusik shut his eyes for a second. “I can still feel the disturbance in the Force. I can sense the destruction and pain and fear. Like a battlefield, in fact.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's what I <em class="calibre6">can't</em> sense that bothers me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Which is?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Malevolence.</em> The enemy is absent. The enemy was never here, in fact.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">* * *</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Republic Fleet Protection Group traffic inderdiction vessel </strong><strong class="calibre11">(TIV) Z590/1, standing off Corellian–Perlemian hyperspace </strong><strong class="calibre11">intersection, 367 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Fi really didn't like zero-g ops.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He took off his helmet with slow care and put one hand on the webbing restraints that stopped him from drifting away from the bulkhead of the anonymous utility vessel that had been customized for armed boarding parties. If he moved a little too quickly, he drifted.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Drifting made him … queasy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman, Niner, and Atin didn't seem bothered by it at all; neither did the pilot, who, for reasons Fi hadn't yet worked out, was called Sicko.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sicko had shut down the drives. The unmilitary, unmarked, apparently unimpressive little TIV—a “plain wrapper,” as the pilots tagged it—hung with drives idling near an exit point of the hyperspace route, cockpit panels flickering with a dozen weapons displays.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Externally, it looked like a battered utility shuttle. Under the rust, though, it was a compact assault platform that could muscle its way onto any vessel. Fi thought that <em class="calibre6">traffic interdiction operations</em> was a lovely euphemism for “heavy-duty military hijack.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I do like a noncompliant boarding to start the day,” Sicko said. “You okay, Fi?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorted,” Fi lied.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're not going to throw up, are you? I just cleaned this crate.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I can keep field rations down, I can handle anything.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell you what, chum, put your bucket back on and keep it to yourself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can aim straight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had learned the skills of maneuvering in zero-g late in life—just before he turned eight and sixteen, not all <em class="calibre6">that</em> long before Geonosis—and it didn't come as naturally to him as those troopers trained specifically for deep-space duties. He wondered why the others had come through the same training with more tolerance of it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner, apparently impervious to every hardship except seeing his squad improperly dressed, stared at the palm of his glove as if willing the wrist-mounted hololink from HQ to activate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The squad now wore the matte-black stealth version of the Katarn armor that made them even more visibly different from the rest of the Republic Commando squads. Niner said it was “sensible” even if it made them pretty conspicuous targets on snow-covered Fest. Fi suspected he liked it better because it also made them look seriously menacing. Droids didn't care, but it certainly put the wind up wets—organic targets—when they saw it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">If</em> they saw it, of course. They usually didn't get the chance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">An occasional click of his teeth indicated Niner was annoyed. It was Skirata's habit, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo's always on time,” Fi said, trying to take his mind off his churning stomach. “Don't fret, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your <em class="calibre6">buddy … ,”</em> Darman teased.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Rather have him for a friend than an enemy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ooh, he <em class="calibre6">likes</em> you. Hobnobbing with ARC officers from the Bonkers Squad, eh?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We have an understanding,” Fi said. “I don't laugh at his skirt, and he doesn't rip my head off.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, Ordo <em class="calibre6">had</em> taken a shine to him. Fi hadn't fully understood it until Skirata had taken him to one side and explained just what had happened to Ordo and his batch on Kamino as kids. So when Fi had thrown himself on a grenade during an anti-terrorist op to smother the detonation, Ordo had marked him out as someone who'd take an awfully big risk to save comrades. Null ARCs were psychotic—bonkers, as Skirata put it—but they were unshakably loyal when the mood struck them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And when the mood failed to strike them, they were instant death on legs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi suspected that Ordo was bored out of his brain, stuck in HQ on Coruscant for most of the last year with nothing to kill except time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So Fi stared at Niner's glove, too, willing his stomach to stay put. At precisely 0900 hours Triple Zero time, right on cue, Niner's palm burst into blue light.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“RC-one-three-zero-nine receiving, sir,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The encrypted link was crystal clear. Ordo shimmered in a blue holoimage, apparently sitting in the cockpit of a police vessel, helmet beside him on the adjoining seat. But he didn't look bored. He was clenching and unclenching one fist.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Su'cuy,</em> Omega. How's it going?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ready to roll, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant, latest intel we have is that the suspect vessel left Cularin bound for Denon and is headed for your position. The bad news is that it appears to be traveling with a couple of legit vessels as a smokescreen. Commercial freight is getting very edgy about piracy so they're forming up into convoys now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We can weed out the target,” said Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It would be very <em class="calibre6">awkward</em> if you decompressed a civilian freighter at the moment. It'll be the Gizer L-six.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Understood.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And we need the <em class="calibre6">di'kute</em> alive. No slotting, no disintegration, no accidents.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not even a good slap?” asked Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Use the PEP laser and keep it nonlethal if you can. Somebody's very keen to have a frank chat with them.” Ordo paused, head tilted down for a second. “Vau's back.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi couldn't stop himself from glancing at Atin and noted that Darman had done the same. Atin had his chin tucked into the padded rim of his chest plate and was idly scratching the scar that ran from just under his right eye and across his mouth to the left side of his jaw. It was a thin white line now, a faint memory of the raw red welt it had been when Fi first saw him: and Fi suddenly realized something he hadn't worked out before.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I think I know how he got that.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin was from Sergeant Walon Vau's training company, not Skirata's. And over the months, as casualties mounted and more partial squads were regrouped with men from other companies, they all swapped stories. The Vau stories didn't get a laugh at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You okay, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fine,” Atin said. He looked up, jaw set. “So how many bandits are we going to <em class="calibre6">not</em> slot, disintegrate, or speak harshly to, then, Captain?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Five, best intel says,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll assume ten then,” said Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo paused for a moment as if he thought Niner might be resorting to sarcasm. Fi could see it in the way his shoulders braced. He was a knife-edge kind of man, Ordo. But Niner was simply in literal mode, as he tended to be when things were getting intense. He always wanted to err on the side of caution.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo obviously knew that: he didn't bite. “By the way, General Tur-Mukan is operating around the Bothan sector, and appears to be coping, according to Commander Gett,” he said. “And she's still packing the cone rifle, so your lesson wasn't wasted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Beats swinging the shiny stick,” Fi said, winking at Darman. “It'd be fun to see her again, eh, Dar?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman smiled enigmatically. Atin was staring in slight defocus at the bulkhead, jaw clenched. Fi thought it was high time the bad guys dropped out of hyperspace and took their minds off the individual things that were troubling them, which included his stomach.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo out,” the blue holo said, and Niner's glove held nothing but air again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman prepped his helmet, resetting the HUD with a prod of his finger. “Poor <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.”</em> He called him by the affectionate nickname Skirata used in private, a kid's name, <em class="calibre6">Little Ordo.</em> In public, it was strictly Captain and Sergeant. And you could call your brother <em class="calibre6">vod'ika</em> in the Mandalorian way, but nobody else could, and <em class="calibre6">never</em> in front of strangers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Who'd want to be doing the filing when the rest of your batch are off saving the galaxy?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I hear Kom'rk is out at Utapau, and Jaing's cannoned up and gone hiking with extreme prejudice in the Bakura sector,” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Knowing him, he's doing it for the fun of it. And as for Mereel—well, why has Kal sent him out to Kamino?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner clicked irritably again. “Anyone else you want to discuss classified intel with, Fi?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The cabin was silent once more. Fi slid his helmet back on, sealed the collar, and concentrated on the artificial horizon of his HUD to convince his stomach which way was up. The Mark III Katarn armor now had more enhancements and was rated blaster-resistant up to light cannon rounds. Every op was full of new surprises from GAR Procurement—like a birthday, according to Skirata, although Fi, like all his brothers, had never celebrated one.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Now they even had a nonlethal pulsed energy projectile, or PEP, for the DC-17 that didn't exactly kill the targets, but certainly made their eyes water. It was police riot control kit, a deuterium fluoride laser: it would probably just annoy a Wookiee, but it sorted out humanoids in short order.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi focused on the icons in the frame of his HUD and blinked one into action, sending chilled air across his face. That soothed his nausea. Then he isolated his audio channel and accessed a articularly thumping piece of glimmik music.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner cut in on the comm channel override. <em class="calibre6">“Now</em> what are you listening to?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mon Cal opera,” Fi said. “I'm improving my mind.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Liar. I can see you nodding to the beat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Relax, Sarge. Please.</em> “Want to listen in?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm psyched up enough, thanks,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman shook his head. Atin looked up. “Later, Fi.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sicko glanced over his shoulder, excluded from the squad's conversation by their secure helmet-to-helmet comlink. But he could obviously see the body language that indicated they were chatting. Fi flicked to his frequency with a couple of blinks directed at the sensor inside his visor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How about you, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?</em> Want some music?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No thanks.” Sicko had much the same neutral accent as most of the infantry trooper clones. They'd learned Basic from flash-instruction and had rarely been exposed to outsiders with interesting accents. “But it's decent of you to offer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anytime.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Commandos owed their lives to the guts of these pilots—Omega had been extracted under heavy fire by their astonishing skill a number of times—and the TIV pilots were the most daring of the lot. Any gulfs among clone trooper, specialist, and the elite commando units had now been swept away by shared hardship and they were <em class="calibre6">an vode</em> now—all brothers. Fi was happy to indulge them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He killed the music feed and switched over to the open squad comlink again. The waiting was eating at him now. If—</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got trade,” said Sicko. “They <em class="calibre6">should</em> be jumping out of hyperspace anytime now. Three contacts.” He flicked the tracking display from his console into a holoprojection so they could see the pulses of color that represented the ships—no outlines or shapes, just a flickering array of numbers and codes to one side, awaiting a ship to tag. “Intercept in two minutes. They should all be less than a minute apart.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bring us in starboard-side-to, please,” said Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There you go … the L-six is coming out first.” Sicko pressed a pad on the console and Fi heard the grapple arms extend and retract like an athlete flexing muscles before an event. The display picked up the ship, then another. “But the second profile looks like an L-six, too …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Intel said—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Intel has <em class="calibre6">occasionally</em> been known to be less than one hundred percent accurate, apparently …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin sighed a <em class="calibre6">ffft</em> of contempt. “You reckon?” Fi could see that he was checking ships' configuration data via his HUD. “I'm glad I'm shockproofed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But we <em class="calibre6">like</em> intel,” said Fi. <em class="calibre6">No, not again. Let it be right this time.</em> “Sergeant Kal never read us bedtime stories, so intel satisfies our innate boyish need for heroic fantasy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is he always like this?” Sicko asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, he's pretty quiet today.” Darman clutched a magnetic frame charge to his chest plate—his <em class="calibre6">hatch persuader,</em> as he liked to call it. “So are we going to jump the first crate or what?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Play it by ear,” said Niner, who always seemed to resort to Skirata's voice under pressure. He hit the release on his restraints. “Let's see how it reacts when we approach. Pressure up helmets, gentlemen, and we're in business.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Coming about,” said Sicko. “And if I can't disable its drive, blow the navigation power conduit. The access ought to be outside the engineering compartment, but it's sometimes inside the port-side bulkhead, three meters from the hatch. So knock the rotten thing out, will you? Or they'll bolt and drag us across ten star systems.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then the pilot punched the TIV into a ninety-degree roll and the apparently fixed constellations Fi had been watching tilted before his eyes. He understood <em class="calibre6">instantly</em> why they called the man Sicko.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi grabbed a restraint instictively and his backpack hit the bulkhead.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Oh fierfek—”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoaaa!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Uhhh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi could see through the cockpit screen as he steadied himself alongside the hatch. A box-like freighter—yes, a Gizer L-6—loomed out of black nothing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Interdict <em class="calibre6">that,</em>”Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi reached for his jet-pack controls, hanging right beside Darman in free fall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sicko powered the TIV into a slow head-on approach and corkscrewed slowly to line it up and bring the deckhead hatch against the port side of the freighter, landing lights on.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The freighter slowed, too. Darman stood ready, fingers flexing over the jet-pack controls on his belt. He'd be first out, blowing the hatch controls when the blastproof coaming sealed against the target's hull, pulling aside to let the others storm in. As the TIV moved sedately along the freighter's flank, the landing lights picked out the bright orange livery of VOSHAN CONTAINERS.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oops,” said Sicko. “Looks like the legit one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Back off, then,” Niner said. “If the other ship sees this, we've lost—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">A flash caught Fi's eye at the same time it did everyone else's. The second vessel was heading their way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Another L-six,” Sicko said. “Please don't let there be three of them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The first L-6 suddenly altered course with a rapid burn. It had probably picked up the wrong idea about a scruffy little ship in an area of space that was frequently populated by pirates. One of its spars wheeled ninety degrees almost instantly, looming in the TIV's viewscreen on collision course.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Abort abort abort!”</em> Sicko yelled. <em class="calibre6">“Brace brace brace—”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He was cut short by a screech of tearing alloy that shuddered through the TIV, and suddenly it wasn't the tight gut-exhilaration of a boarding but the desperate scramble to survive. The impact spun the TIV off and the last thing Fi saw as he somersaulted involuntarily was Sicko pulling on the yoke and punching a stabilizing burn to stop the spin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was nothing Fi or the squad could do. It was all down to the pilot. Fi hated that moment of helpless realization every time. The display in his HUD shuddered like a cheap bootleg holovid as he hit the bulkhead harder than he thought possible in zero-g.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Incoming! Returning fire.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then there was light: brilliant blue-white light. The instant hot rain of fragments peppered and pecked on the hull. Sicko had neutralized the incoming missile. The second L-6 powered up and punched back into hyperspace in a flare of light.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Chew on <em class="calibre6">that,”</em> Sicko said, and slapped his fist hard on the console. “Foam deployed … hull breach secure.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's that?” Fi said, suddenly ice-cold and focused, and not nauseous at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“BRB.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Big Red Button. Emergency hull seal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The remains of the freighter's missile cartwheeled slowly into the distance, trailing vapor. It was the kind of self-defense many freighters felt the need to carry these days: wars created useful opportunity for the criminal community.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner sighed. “Oh, fierfek, everyone knows we're here now …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anyone get his license number?” Fi said. “Maniac.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, and more maniacs along shortly, too.” Sicko turned his head toward the scanner readout. “Next one's due in sixty seconds … and the next one two minutes later, I reckon. I hope he doesn't call for assistance, or we're going to have to bang out of here <em class="calibre6">really</em> fast.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell me they're not going to notice that little fracas.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're not going to notice that little fracas.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Vor'e,</em> brother.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're welcome.” The pilot didn't take his eyes off the scanner. “Happy to lie to a comrade anytime, if it makes him feel better—there you go …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The next freighter fell out of hyperspace fifteen hundred meters from their port bow, and its pilot definitely <em class="calibre6">noticed.</em> Fi knew that because the immediate bright arc of laser cannon shaved the elint mast mounted on the TIV's nose just as Sicko let loose a sustained volley into the freighter's under-slung drive. It was still showering debris as Sicko brought the TIV about and swung back under the freighter to loop over its casing from its starboard quarter and bring the TIV, totally inverted, to rest hatch-to-hatch with the target.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And there was nothing the crippled freighter could do about it. Sicko was too close in, too far inside the minimum range of its cannon, and now riding a very angry Ralltiiri tiger.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is where you get off.” Sicko's voice was just a little shaky. “End of the line.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Stand to!”</em> Niner said. The skirt of coaming shot out of the TIV's hatch housing and sealed tight against the freighter's hull while the grapple arms held it secure. The pressure equalization light flashed red and the TIV's blastproof inner hatch opened, then the outer one. <em class="calibre6">“Dar,</em> take it!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Dar slapped the frame charges on the freighter's hatch, the inner hatch snapped shut again, and a muffled <em class="calibre6">whump</em> vibrated through the TIV.</div>

<div class="paragraph">How Sicko had managed to bring the TIV alongside the port hatch without ramming the vessel—or ripping the deck-head out of the TIV—Fi would never understand, but that was what trooper pilots did, and he was in awe of them. The inner hatch opened again. Darman bowled in two flash-bangs blinding, deafening stun grenades—and Niner was first through the hatch.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Go go go—”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi, buoyed up on a wave of adrenaline, plunged through after him, DC-17 set to blaster mode. The TIV and Sicko were swept from his mind from that moment as time disobeyed all the rules and he was caught in an infinite, slow-motion split second while the squad burst through the hatch and the L-6's artificial gravity smacked him down hard on the deck. The impact ran up through the soles of his boots. He was running for seconds before his proprioception caught up with the gravity and his body said <em class="calibre6">I remember this.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">But there weren't many places to run on an L-6 freighter. It was a cockpit and a couple of cabins bolted to a durasteel box of nothing. Atin moved ahead and simply opened up with the Deece's new PEP laser, knocking two men flat in a massive shock wave of sound and light as they came out of the starboard cabin firing blasters.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's anti-flash visor darkened instantly. Even with armor, he felt the shock of the PEP'S unleashed energy. They all did.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi ran on over Atin as he dropped to one knee to cuff and search the men, wrists to ankles, as they lay struggling for breath, whimpering. A PEP round was like being flashbanged <em class="calibre6">and</em> hit in the chest by several plastoid rounds at once.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was usually nonlethal. Usually.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Two down, three—maybe—to go.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The cockpit doors didn't open when Niner stood back and hit the controls. Atin caught up with Fi again and they stood catching their breath.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner motioned Darman into position at the cockpit doors. “Shame that PEP doesn't work through bulkheads.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Confirmed, three still inside,” Darman said, running the infrared sensor sweep in his gauntlet up and down the seam of the doors. “Nothing in the port cabin.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Intel had it right for once: there <em class="calibre6">were</em> five bandits on board.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Encourage them to step outside, Dar,” Niner said, checking his Deece's PEP setting. He peered at the power readout. “This thing actually scares me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman unrolled a ribbon of adhesive thermal charge and pressed it around the doors' weak points. Then he pushed the det into the soft material and cocked his head to one side as if calculating. “All that fuss getting in and now we just walk over them. Anticlimactic, I think the word is …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a dull echoing thud and screech of metal that vibrated through the deck. For a second Fi thought the det had gone off prematurely and that it was all a trick of his adrenaline-distorted perception, and that he was dead but didn't know it yet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But it wasn't the det.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi looked at Niner, and Niner looked at Atin, and Fi saw in Darman's viewpoint icon that he was staring at a fragment of flimsi that whipped past him as if snatched by a sudden wind.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It <em class="calibre6">was</em> being carried on a stream of air. <em class="calibre6">Escaping air.</em> Fi felt it grab him and they all reached instinctively for a secure point to anchor them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Hull breach,” Fi said, arms tight around a stanchion. “Check suit seals.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They went into an automatic and long-drilled check of their suit systems. Katarn armor was vacuumproofed. Fi's glove sensor confirmed his suit was still airtight and the thumbs-up from the rest of the squad indicated that their suit integrity was holding up too. The temporary gale of escaping air was abating.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sicko, you receiving?” said Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had the same thought, and judging by the rapid breathing on the shared comlink, so had Atin and Darman. The decompression was via the hatch. And that meant the seal formed by the TIV had been breached.</div>

<div class="paragraph">On their comlink there was only faint static and the sound of their own breathing and swallowing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Atin said. “Whatever it is, he's gone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner motioned Darman to stay by the cockpit hatch and beckoned Fi to follow him. “Let's see if it's fixable. You two stay there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, we've probably lost two prisoners now,” Darman said. “Better make sure we haven't lost the rest.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no telling what had dislodged the TIV and whether they were going to meet someone boarding to deal with <em class="calibre6">them.</em> They made their way back up the passage to the entry hatch, DC-17s raised, and there was no sign of the two prisoners they'd left cuffed, nor anybody else.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the hatch—about two meters by two—was wide open, star-speckled void visible beyond.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi gripped the rail on one side of it and leaned out a little. It was a good way to get your head blown off but he decided that the urgency of the situation warranted it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no sign of the TIV. There was no sign of <em class="calibre6">anything.</em> He pulled himself back inboard. At least the gravity was still functioning.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner checked the environment sensors on his forearm plate. “Atmosphere's fully vented now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They have to have a foam system in these things.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, but if you had us running around <em class="calibre6">your</em> vessel, would <em class="calibre6">you</em> seal the hull and help us out?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is the cockpit airtight?” Fi asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We won't know for sure until they go cold and we can't pick them up in the infrared.” Niner switched on his tactical spot-lamp and began searching the bulkhead for panels. “And by that time we'll be ice cubes ourselves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Katarn armor—even the Mark III version—was only good against vacuum for twenty minutes without a backup air supply. And they hadn't counted on being exposed that long.</div>

<div class="paragraph">For some reason Fi was distracted by Sicko's fate. It was a strange thing to discover when you were on borrowed time yourself. But Sicko had said the power conduits were routed via a panel three meters from …</div>

<div class="paragraph">… <em class="calibre6">here.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi ejected the vibroblade from his knuckle plate and pried open the panel. Niner stood behind him and directed his spot-lamp into the recessed mass of cabling, pipes, and wires.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That one's labeled ISOLATION BULKHEAD,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, but where does that come down?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They looked up at the deckhead for shutter housings. There were at least three back down the passage that they could see.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's play safe and withdraw to the one nearest the cockpit,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We could blow the whole panel here and shut everything down.” <em class="calibre6">Including the gravity. Lovely.</em> “Usually triggers emergency containment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner put his glove to the side of his helmet. It was a nervous habit of his, just like the way he grew increasingly irritable with Fi as his stress levels peaked. “Dar, are you getting this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Halfway there already,” said Darman's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's chrono said they had fifteen minutes left to make this work. “Okay, if Dar blows this remotely and it activates the emergency bulkhead, then we'll be stuck between that and the cockpit hatch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And if there's atmosphere in there, we can open it and cozy up to the other three <em class="calibre6">huruune.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Or,” Fi said, “we find it's hard vacuum, too, and then we'll be completely stuffed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stuffed if we <em class="calibre6">don't,”</em> said Darman, appearing at Fi's shoulder with a ribbon of thermal detonator tape. “Go on. Get back there and wait for me while I set the timer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We ought to call in a Red Zero.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's wait until we know if there'll be anything left of us to make it worth rescuing,” Niner said, trotting back down the passage. Fi watched him go, shrugged at Darman, and then patted the wide-open cover of the control panel.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, Sicko,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">–Much Regret Unable, signal relayed from CO, RAS <em class="calibre6">Fearless,</em> on receipt of request to withdraw to Skuumaa and abort extraction of Sarlacc Battalions</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The windchill factor in the open troop bay of a LAAT/c gunship flying at five hundred kph was sobering, but then so was the deafening roar of air and the swoops and dips of the flight path as the pilot jinked to stop ground-based AA fire from getting a lock.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain realized why the troopers' sealed armor and body-suit was a good idea. She had only her Jedi robes and the sensible precaution of upper-body armor plates, which did little to insulate on their own. She summoned the Force to help her withstand the icy blast and made sure her safety line was hooked securely to the bulkhead rail.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're going to be in the dwang when you get back to HQ, General,” the clone trooper sergeant said with a grin. He slipped on his helmet and sealed it. His nickname was Clanky. She'd made a point of asking.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I really did not see the signal,” she said carefully. “Or at least I looked at it a little too late.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">His voice emerged now from the projection unit of the anonymous helmet. “It was very funny, signaling <em class="calibre6">MRU.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Funny? Oh …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a frozen pause. “It's how you decline a social invitation, an <em class="calibre6">RPC.</em><em class="calibre6">R</em>equest the <em class="calibre6">P</em>leasure of your <em class="calibre6">C</em>ompany? <em class="calibre6">M</em>uch <em class="calibre6">R</em>egret <em class="calibre6">U</em>nable.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, she was in the dwang indeed, as he put it. She wasn't fully up to speed with the mass of acronyms and slang that had erupted in the last year. She could hardly keep up with the clone troopers' inventiveness: their extraordinary capacity to appropriate language and habits and shape them to their needs had spawned subcultures of clone identity everywhere. She almost felt she needed a protocol droid.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But she knew what a larty was. Darman had said the LAAT/i—or in this case, the bigger cargo variant—was the most beautiful vessel imaginable when you needed an urgent lift out of trouble. It certainly felt like it now.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">MRU indeed. How could I be so stupid?</em> So the troopers thought she was a smart-mouth like Fi, flourishing a little bravado. Instead, she was simply ignorant of the rapidly evolving and idiosyncratic jargon and used it carelessly. “I'm sure they'll forgive me if you pull this off, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Her voice was drowned by the roar, and falling note of V-19 Torrent drives as two of the fighters streaked past them and disappeared into the distance. They were heading off to soften the droid positions that stood between the heavily forested terrain where both Sarlacc Battalions were pinned down and there was a narrow ribbon of delta shoreline where pilots could land. Droids, as Darman had once pointed out, were <em class="calibre6">rubbish</em> in dense forests.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain hoped so.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The gunship dropped suddenly, now level with the tree canopy, and the streaked image of green foliage showed her just how fast they were flying. Another larty came up on their port side. There were thirty-four gunships somewhere near, strung out in a loose formation, heading for the extraction zone.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Three minutes, General,” the pilot's cockpit intercom said. There was a crack and flare of something exploding off to their starboard side. “Getting some attention from the tinnies' triple-A, so we'll drop a little more. Hold tight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It hardly made her flinch now. She had reached the saturation level of adrenaline where she was vividly aware of every hazard but running on some primeval automatic level of painless cold reason—too scared to panic, as one of the clone troopers had described it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Three minutes became three hours became three seconds.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Red blasterfire from droids lit up the tree line as the larty banked to come around in a spiral descent. Etain didn't think, and she didn't feel, and she simply jumped the last ten meters from the open deck over the fast-roping four-man squad of clone troopers and the green-trimmed sergeant. Force skills came in very useful at the most unlikely times. She landed in front of the squad and brought the conc rifle up level—one hand on the stock, the other on the barrel grip—to sweep the forest edge in front of her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She felt other gunships landing all around them, whipping up soil and leaves, but she saw only what was in front—about two platoons of Sarlacc men exchanging fire with super battle droids on the edge of the clearing—and her squad to either side of her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A spread of ten EMP grenades from the squad and a volley from her conc brought half the super battle droids to a halt. It was at times like this that she longed for the comlink convenience of a helmet instead of one strapped to her arm in just the wrong place: the Force was short on specifics like <em class="calibre6">SBD strength one hundred units, closing up at green twenty.</em> And there was so much chaos and pain in the Force right then that she couldn't harness it to focus.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So she did what she had been drilled to do without thinking since she was four years old. She <em class="calibre6">fought.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She ran, the squad matching her pace and firing a blue stream into the droid line in odd silence until Clanky activated his voice projector and she heard him say, “—they're closing up all along the shoreline. Sorry, General! Big holes now in the droid lines.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No link,” she said, superfluous words stripped from her mind. The concussion rifle was getting heavy and running out of charge: the power indicator was edging back down to zero. Two more volleys knocked three SBDs flat and a small tree with them. “How many more?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Forward Air Control says two hundred SBDs and tanks bearing twenty degrees with four Torrents on their case—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">More V-19s screamed low overhead and a yellow-fringed ball of white fire backlit the forest, suddenly throwing silhouetted trees and running men into sharp contrast. <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> air group commander certainly had a grip on the reality of the situation. No wonder everybody loved pilots.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Clanky dropped flat and began firing prone at the stream of SBDs that had turned toward the gunship landing area. Etain followed him without thinking. He was listening to data in his helmet, judging by his occasional emphatic nod.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sarlacc's breaking out all along the shoreline, General, and <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> is directing the rest of the larties north.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Any word on General Vaas Ga?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Clanky went silent for a moment, to her at least. “One klick north with Commander Gree, calling in air strikes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Two gunships moved in close enough to catch Etain's peripheral vision and knots of men broke from the trees, some carrying wounded comrades between them. Etain hoped the single IM-6 medical droid on each larty could handle the triage of dozens of men at once. One gunship set down again at right angles to the tree line, its starboard hatch shut tight and taking droid fire that scattered sparks while it trained composite beam lasers on the SBDs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The starboard gunner—horribly exposed in the transparisteel bubble set in the wing—was hosing the droids at waist height. Etain saw movement and white-armored shapes race behind the vessel and disappear, presumably into the port side of the troop bay. The torrent of comp beam laser was like a freeze-frame in its unbroken, steady stream.</div>

<div class="paragraph">For a slow-motion moment Etain reasoned: using the forward cannon and deploying the heavier and nastier armaments—radiation burst missiles—would cause heavy trooper casualties in this position. Her mouth was dry, her heart pounding so fast that she could hardly distinguish between beats, and yet she could stop the chrono to think these odd things.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She resumed firing. She held her fingers tight on the trigger until the conc died in her hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoa, tinnies breaking <em class="calibre6">this way—”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Her focus narrowed. She no longer saw the five men around her except as white blurs and vortices of raw energy in the Force. The lead battle droid overran their position and she simply swung the dead rifle in a Force-driven arc right up into the thing's chest, smashing the alloy and sending the droid's sunken head assembly flying into the air.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was suddenly aware of blue energy behind the next droid like a continuous backdrop, although it had to be interrupted bursts of DC-15 fire. She let the cone rifle drop and drew her lightsaber because she had nothing else left.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The blade of blue light sprang into life and she didn't recall touching the control at all. She swept her arm around in a clean arc that brought the mountain of metal down without its legs, tipping like a felled tree to one side of her, falling flat on its firing arm and shuddering as its own discharging weapon tore it apart. Hot shrapnel sizzled on her robes and skin but she felt nothing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And she was on her feet now, lightsaber gripped in both hands, point-blank with the next droid. She saw two of her squad blasting away from a prone position while Clanky scrambled to one knee to fire a grenade into the advancing rank of a dozen SBDs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Droids kept advancing. So did clone troopers. And so did she.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">We're all the same. None of us is thinking. We're just reacting.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She fended off a barrage of red fire, whirling and flicking the lightsaber without conscious decision. Each snazzz of colliding energy was the first and last: she went on, and on, and on, blocking each shot as if it would never end. And the next droid was upon her. She slashed. Cables and alloy fragments showered her. A white-gauntleted fist grabbed her shoulder and pulled her bodily out of the way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bang out, General, the larty's ready to lift” Clanky almost had to drag her off the pile of shattered droids and shove her into a run toward the gunship. “We've done all we can here and the bay's full. Go! <em class="calibre6">Run!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She grabbed the cone rifle as she ran back, retracing their line of advance, blind on adrenaline. But at the gunship's platform she still stopped dead, one foot on the edge of the rail, to look back and count men passing her. One—two—three—<em class="calibre6">four</em> troopers, and Clanky. All accounted for. She sprang up just as an armored hand gripped hers and yanked her inboard. She had no idea who the trooper was. But he was one of hers now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The gunship lifted in a straight vertical so fast that her stomach plummeted back to ground level.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The forest and fertile delta plain of Dinlo shrank beneath the ship and grew dark. The bay hatches slid forward and slammed shut. Then she was standing in a warehouse of scorched, filthy armor and the stench of blood and seared flesh. Her primeval survival mechanisms yielded to shaking anticlimax.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Clanky pulled off his helmet and their eyes met, an odd moment that was almost a glance in a mirror: she knew that the unblinking wide-eyed shock on his face was exactly what he was seeing on hers. Instinctively, they both reached out to clasp forearms and their grips locked for a second or two. Clanky was also shaking.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then they parted and turned away. It was synchronous.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Yes,</em> Etain thought. <em class="calibre6">We're just the same, all of us.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was very, very quiet once she blocked out the thrum of the gunship's drive as it made 660 kph—off the dial—back to <em class="calibre6">Fearless.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And no, the IM-6 droid could <em class="calibre6">not</em> deal with forty men crammed into a modified bay better suited to thirty, not if a quarter of them were injured.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then, when Etain listened more carefully and her adrenaline had ebbed, she realized the bay wasn't as quiet as she had thought. There was ragged breathing and stifled yelps of pain and—the worst, this—incoherent whimpering that peaked to a crescendo of a single stifled scream and trailed off again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She picked her way across the bay, stepping over men who were crouching or kneeling. Propped against the bulkhead, a clone trooper was being held in a sitting position by a brother. His helmet and chest plate were removed and Etain needed no med droid to provide a prognosis for a chest wound that was producing blood on his lips.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Medic?” She whipped around. <em class="calibre6">“Medic!</em> Get this man some help, now!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The med droid appeared as if from nowhere, jerking bolt upright from a knot of troopers where it was obviously working. Its twin photoreceptors trained on her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why is this man not being attended to?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Triage <em class="calibre6">X,”</em> the droid said, dropping down into the unbroken carpet of troopers again to resume its first aid.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain should have known. The red X symbol glowed on his shoulder. She hoped the man hadn't heard, but he probably knew anyway, because that was the unsentimental way the Kaminoans had presented their training to the clones. <em class="calibre6">Triage code X: too badly injured. Not expected to survive despite intervention. Concentrate resources on code 3, then code 5.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She took a breath and reminded herself that she was a Jedi, and there was more to being a Jedi than wielding a lightsaber. She knelt down beside him and grabbed his hand. The grip he returned was surprisingly strong for a dying man.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's okay,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She reached out in the Force to get some sense of the injury, to shape it in her mind, hoping to slow the hemorrhage and hold shattered tissue together until the larty docked. But she knew as soon as she formed the scale of the damage in her mind that it wouldn't save him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She had vowed never again to use mind influence on clones without their consent: she had eased Atin's grief, and given Niner confidence when he most needed it, both unasked for, but since then she had avoided it. Clones weren't weak-minded anyway, whatever people thought. But this man was dying, and he needed help.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm Etain,” she said. She concentrated on his eyes, seeing behind them somehow into a swirl of no color at all, and visualized calm. She held out her hand to the trooper supporting his shoulders and mouthed <em class="calibre6">medpacs</em> at him. She knew they carried single-use syringes of powerful painkiller: Darman had used them in front of her more than once. “There's nothing to be afraid of. What's your nickname?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi,” he said, and it shocked her briefly, but there were many men called Fi in an army with numbers for names. His brother said <em class="calibre6">no</em> silently and held up spent syringes: they'd already pumped him full of what little they had. “Thank you, ma'am.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">If she could influence thought, she could influence endorphin systems. She put every scrap of her will into it. “The pain's going. The drug's working. Can you feel it?” If the Force had any validity, it <em class="calibre6">had</em> to come to her aid now. She studied his face, and his jaw muscles were relaxing a little. “How's that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Better, thanks, ma'am.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You hang on. You might feel a bit sleepy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">His grip was still tight. She squeezed back. She wondered if he knew she was lying and just chose to believe the lie for his own comfort. He didn't say anything else, but he didn't scream again, and his face looked peaceful.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She rested his head on her shoulder, one hand between his head and the bulkhead, the other still clutching his, and held that position for ten minutes, concentrating on an image of a cool pale void. Then he started a choking cough. His brother took his other hand, and Fi—a painful reminder of a friend she hadn't seen for months and might never see again—said, “I'm fine.” His grip went slack.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, ma'am,” said his brother.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain was aware in a detached way of spending the next twenty minutes talking to every single trooper in that bay, asking their names, asking who had been lost, and wondering why they stared first at her chest and then at her face, apparently bewildered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She put her hand to her cheek. It stung. She brushed it and a fragment of alloy came away on her hand with fresh, bright blood. She hadn't felt the shrapnel until then. She aimed herself towards a familiar patch of green in the forest of grimy white armor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clanky,” she said, numb. “Clanky, I never asked. Where do we bury our men? Or do we cremate them, like Jedi?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Neither, usually, General,” said Clanky. “Don't you worry about that now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She looked down at her beige robe and noticed that it was way beyond filthy: it was peppered with burns, as if she'd been welding carelessly, and there was a ragged oval patch of deep red blood from her right shoulder down to her belt, already drying into stiff blackness.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Master Camas is going to fry me,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He can fry us, too, then,” Clanky said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain knew she'd think about the deftly evaded answer to her question sometime, but right then her mind was elsewhere. She thought of Darman, suddenly conscious that something was wrong: but something was always wrong for commandos on missions, and the Force was clear that Darman was still alive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But the other Fi—the trooper—wasn't. Etain felt ashamed of her personal fears and went in search of men she could still help.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Bravo Eight Depot crime scene, Manarai, </strong><strong class="calibre11">Coruscant, 367 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata took every clone casualty as a personal affront. His frustration wasn't aimed at Obrim: the two men respected each other in the way of time-served professionals, and Ordo knew that. He just hoped Obrim knew that <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> didn't always mean the sharp things he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So when are your people going to get off their <em class="calibre6">shebse</em> and tell us how the device got in here?” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Soon,” Obrim said. “The security holocam was taken out in the blast. We're waiting on a backup image from the satellite. Won't be as clear, but at least we have it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Jailer,” Skirata said, still chewing, eyes fixed on the rubble. “No offense.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know, comrade. None taken.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was another reason why Ordo adored his sergeant: he was the archetypal <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad.</em> A Mandalorian man's ideal was to be the firm but loving father, the respectful son learning from every hard experience, the warrior loyal to constant personal principles rather than ever-changing governments and flags.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He also knew when to apologize.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he looked exhausted. Ordo wondered when he would understand that nobody expected him to keep up with young soldiers. “You could leave this to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're a good lad, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika,</em> but I have to do this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo put one hand square on Skirata's back and one on Obrim's to steer them both a little farther from the scene of destruction, anxious not to make it obvious in front of the <em class="calibre6">aruetiise—the</em> non-Mandalorians, the foreigners, sometimes even the traitors—that his sergeant needed comforting. Waiting was the worst thing for <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir's</em> mood.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim's comlink chirped. “Here we go,” he said. “They're relaying the image. Let's play it out to Ordo's link.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The images emerged as a grainy blue aerial holo rising from the palm of Ordo's gauntlet, and they replayed it a few times. A delivery transport came up to the barrier and was waved in to land on the strip. Then the scene erupted in a ball of light followed by billows of smoke and raining debris.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The explosion blew out the transparisteel-and-granite walls of the Bravo Eight supply depot fifteen times before Ordo had seen enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Looks like the device came in on that delivery transport,” Obrim said. Some of the recognizable debris scattered around the blast site confirmed that there had been a transport caught up in the explosion. “Nobody running away. So the pilot was inside, and …” He stopped to look down at data loading into his own 'pad. “I'm getting confirmation that it was a routine delivery and the pilot was a regular civilian driver. Nothing to suggest that it was a suicide mission, though. Just a routine run with some extra unwanted supplies.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can we go back over the recordings from previous days?” Ordo said. “Just to see if anyone was doing a recce of vessels and movements in the run-up to this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Archived for ten days. Won't be any better in terms of angle and clarity than this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll still take it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo looked to Skirata, who was silent and visibly angry, but clearly thinking hard. Ordo knew that calculating defocus all too well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, the best lead we have right now <em class="calibre6">is</em> to track back the other way down the line—from confirmed explosives supply chains,” Kal said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega's on a TIOPS run checking that right now,” Ordo said. “They might come back with some suspects for Vau to work on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm turning a blind eye to that, right?” said Obrim, a man who left the impression he would have given a lot to be back in the front line instead-of supervising others. “Because suspects are <em class="calibre6">my</em> part of ship to deal with. But I do have this annoying eyesight problem lately.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Long-term condition?” Skirata asked, moving Ordo out of his way with a gentle pat on the forearm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“As permanent as you want it to be, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Make it incurable for the time being, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata picked his way past the forensics team, who were still setting marker holotags at various points in the rubble: red holos for body parts, blue for inorganic evidence. Ordo wondered if the civilians who'd been gawking from behind the barrier would see anything about <em class="calibre6">that</em> on the HNE bulletin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused and leaned over a Sullustan technician who was sensor-scanning the rubble on hands and knees. “Can I have the armor tallies when you find them?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tallies?” The Sullustan sat back on her heels and looked up at him with round black liquid eyes. “Explain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The little sensor tags that identify the soldier. On the chest plates.” Skirata held finger and thumb a little apart to indicate the size. “There'll be fifteen around here somewhere.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We can sort the admin for you, Kal,” Obrim said. “Don't worry about all that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, it's not to account for them. I want a piece of their armor. To pay our respects, the <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo noted Obrim's puzzled expression. “Bodies are irrelevant to us. Which is just as well, really.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim nodded gravely and ushered them behind another plastoid screen where the SOCO team was assembling and logging fragments of alloy and other barely identifiable materials on a trestle table. “You can take over all this if you want.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata motioned Ordo across to the trestle. “It's Ordo's area, but I'm happy for your people to process it. I've got faith in Sullustan diligence.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Maybe it was just Skirata indulging in harmless hearts and-minds work. But it seemed to do the job for the SOCO personnel.</div>

<div class="paragraph">One of them looked up. “It's good to know that military intelligence respects CSF.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've never been called military intelligence before,” Skirata said, as if he hadn't realized that was what he had been doing every waking moment since five days after Geonosis.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo held out one hand to the nearest scenes-of-crime officer and crooked a finger to gesture for their datapad. “You'll need this,” he said, and linked it to his own 'pad. “Here's our latest IED data.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, the CSF's anti-terrorism unit and Skirata's tight-knit team had become very close indeed in the last year. Going through official Republic security clearance channels just wasted time, and there was always the chance its civil servants would behave like petty fools across the galaxy and mark data as top secret for their own dreary little career reasons. Ordo didn't have time for that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was checking that the data had transferred cleanly when the hololink on the inner side of his forearm plate activated again and his hand was filled with a small scene of blue chaos.</div>

<div class="paragraph">For a split second he thought it was an image in his HUD, but it was external, and it was Omega Squad.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega—Red Zero, Red Zero, Red Zero, over.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The holoimage showed the four commandos pressed against a bulkhead with an occasional fragment of debris floating into view. They were all alive, anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata whipped around at the sound of Niner's voice and the code they all dreaded: <em class="calibre6">Red Zero,</em> request for immediate extraction.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo switched instantly and without conscious thought into emergency procedure, capturing coordinates from the message and holding up his datapad so that Skirata could see the numbers and open a comlink to Fleet. Their language changed: their voices became monotone and quiet, and they slipped into minimal, direct speech. The SOCO team froze to watch.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sitrep, Omega.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Target's boarded. Unplanned decompression, and our pilot and the TIV are missing. No power, but no squad casualties.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Fleet, Skirata here, we have a Red Zero. Fast extraction please—on these coordinates. Pilot down, too, no firm location.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand by, Omega. We're scrambling Fleet assistance now. Time to critical?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ten minutes if we don't get the hatch on this side of us open, maybe three hours if we do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stopped, comlink still held to his mouth. Obrim was staring at the little blue hologrammic figures with the expression of a man realizing something terrible.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">We could be watching them as they die.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Go on,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Three suspects the other side of that hatch, and they can't open it now even if they wanted to. Dar's got to blow it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In a confined space?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've got the armor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Well, that was true: Fi had withstood a contact blast from a grenade in Mark II armor. “You don't have any choice, do you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've had worse days,” Fi said cheerfully.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo knew he meant it. He could feel the other part of him, the <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika</em> who wanted to cry for his brothers, but he was very distant, as if in another life: there was just absolute cold detachment in the physical shell where his mind was situated now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do it,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The Red Zero's been transmitted to all GAR ships in striking distance,” Skirata said. Ordo didn't want him to watch the hololink in case things didn't go as planned, and turned his back to him. But Skirata turned him around by his arm and stepped into the holo pickup's field of view so the squad could see him. “I'm here, lads. You're coming home, okay? Sit tight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a certainty about Skirata regardless of how impossible that assurance sounded in cold reality. But Ordo could feel his utter helplessness, and shared it: Omega was light-years from the Coruscant system, far beyond the sergeant's ability to step into the firing line in person. The two soldiers turned together to shield the holoimage, and then Obrim moved in close, diplomatically blocking the view of his own team.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your lad Fi,” he said, “—my boys <em class="calibre6">still</em> want to buy him that drink.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was Obrim's men Fi had saved from the grenade. And that was probably as openly sentimental as Jailer Obrim would ever be.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In five,” Darman said. <em class="calibre6">“Four …”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Like a HoloNet drama whose budget hadn't run to a decent set, the image in Ordo's cupped hand showed the squad curling themselves against the far bulkhead, grasping conduit to anchor themselves in zero-g, heads tucked to their chests and hunkering down.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The image disappeared as Niner—whose gauntlet obviously carried the holofeed—buried his head, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Three, two, go!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The picture flared into a ball of blue light and the silent explosion looked even more like a poor-quality holovid whose audio track had failed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The holoimage dimmed for a moment and then the squad's jet packs ignited and they surged forward in free fall, rifles raised, and the video feed broke up into wildly random movement with two more blinding flashes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, three bandits down, <em class="calibre6">not</em> slotted, <em class="calibre6">not</em> fragmented, but <em class="calibre6">not</em> very happy either,” said Fi's voice, clearly relieved. “And oxygen.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nice one, Omega.” Skirata had his eyes shut for a moment. He pinched the bridge of his nose hard enough to leave a temporary white mark. “Now take it easy until we get to you, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim's face was ashen. “I wish the public realized what those boys do,” he said. “I hate kriffing secrecy sometimes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Shabu'droten,”</em> Skirata muttered, and walked away. No, he didn't care much for the public at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's that mean?” Obrim asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't want to know,” said Ordo, mulling over Jusik's tenuous analysis of the Force around the blast scene. <em class="calibre6">The enemy was never here.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">So … maybe there was nobody watching.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was <em class="calibre6">nobody waiting for precisely the most damaging moment</em> to detonate the device from nearby.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Remote detonation of a moving device required one of two things: either a very good view of the target, or, if the target wasn't visible, a precise timetable so the terrorist would know <em class="calibre6">exactly</em> where the device might be at any given time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And that meant either a very good knowledge of GAR logistics, or—if the terrorist wanted to see the whole area, not just the immediate base—access to security holo networks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo felt a sudden cool clarity settle in his stomach, a satisfying sense of having learned something new and valuable.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen,” he said. “I think we have a mole.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RAS </strong><strong class="calibre11"><em class="calibre6">Fearless: </em></strong><strong class="calibre11">hangar deck</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Clanky kept a tight grip on Etain's upper arm until she felt the drag of deceleration and the thud through the soles of her boots as the gunship docked in <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> hangar.</div>

<div class="paragraph">By the time she teetered on the edge of the troop bay, somehow more wary of jumping down one meter than ten, Gett was waiting, expression carefully blank.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The general's got a taste for making shrapnel,” Clanky said approvingly. “You're instant droid death, aren't you, ma'am?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Helmet off, he lowered his voice as he bent his head close to Gett's, but she still heard him. She heard the words <em class="calibre6">rough time.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'd better get you cleaned up,” Gett said. “I fear it's the proverbial interview without caf when we get back to Fleet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Commander Gree limped past them with General Vaas Ga, both looking smoke-streaked and exhausted. “Oh, I don't think so,” Vaas Ga said. “Well done. Thank you, <em class="calibre6">Fearless.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let me walk this off a little, please, Commander.” Etain looked around the hangar deck, now crowded with gunships disgorging men. Medical teams moved in. The smell of burned paint and lube oil distracted her. “Anyone want to give me the numbers?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett glanced down at the panel on his left forearm. “Improcco Company—four KIA, fifteen wounded, total returned—one hundred and forty out of one hundred and forty-four. Sarlacc A and B Battalions, one thousand and fifty-eight extracted—ninety-four KIA, two hundred and fifteen injured. No MIA. Twenty Torrents deployed and returned. That's <em class="calibre6">seven point five percent</em> losses, and most of those were during the Dinlo engagement itself. So I'd call that a result, General.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It sounded like a lot of deaths to Etain. It was. But most had made it. She had to be content with that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Back to Triple Zero, then.” She'd called it <em class="calibre6">Zero Zero Zero</em> originally—the street slang—but the troopers had told her that was confusing, and that over a comlink it wouldn't be clear if she meant Coruscant or was simply using the standard military triple repeat of important data. She decided she liked <em class="calibre6">Triple Zero</em> better anyway. It made her feel part of their culture. “And not before time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very good, General,” Gett said. “Let me know when you want to refresh yourself and I'll call a steward.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain didn't want to be back in her cabin on her own, not right now. There was a mirror on the bulkhead above the tiny basin, and she didn't like the idea of looking herself in the eye yet. She wandered around the crowded hangar.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The bacta tanks were going to be fully occupied on the journey home.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the clone troopers of the Forty-first Elite who were trying to find somewhere to get a few hours' sleep seemed a different breed from the four almost-boys who had been her rough-and-ready introduction to unwanted command on Qiilura.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Men changed in a year, and these soldiers around her <em class="calibre6">were</em> men. Whatever naïve purity of purpose—this <em class="calibre6">kote,</em> this glory—fueled them when they left Kamino for the last time, it had been overwritten by bitter experience. They had seen, and they had lived, and they had lost brothers, and they had talked and compared notes. And they were not the same any longer.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They joked, and gossiped, and evolved small subcultures, and mourned. But they would never have a life beyond battle. And that felt <em class="calibre6">wrong.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain could feel it and taste it as she wandered across the hanger deck, looking for more troopers she might be able to help. The sense of <em class="calibre6">child</em> that had so disoriented her when she first met Darman on Qiilura was totally absent. There were two shades of existence that tinted the Force in that vast hangar: resignation, and an overwhelming simultaneous sense of both self and community.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain felt irrelevant. The clones didn't need her. They were confident of their own abilities, very centered in whatever identity had evolved despite the Kaminoan belief that they were predictable and standardized units, and they were bonded irrevocably with each other.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She could hear the quiet conversations. There was the occasional word of <em class="calibre6">Mando'a,</em> which few ordinary troopers had ever been taught, but had somehow flowed through their ranks from sources like Skirata and Vau. They clung to it. Knowing what she knew about Mandalorians, it made perfect sense.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the only rationale that <em class="calibre6">could</em> make sense when you were fighting for a cause in which you had absolutely no stake. It was the self-respect of a mercenary; internal, unassailable, and based on skill and comradeship.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But mercenaries got paid, and eventually went home, wherever that might be.</div>

<div class="paragraph">One trooper was waiting patiently for the medic. He had a triage flash stuck on his shoulder plate: the number “5,” <em class="calibre6">walking wounded.</em> There was blood streaked across his armor from a shrapnel wound to his head, and he was holding his helmet in his lap, trying to clean it with a scrap of rag. Etain squatted down and patted his arm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General?” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She had so ceased to notice their appearance that it took her a few seconds to see Darman's face in his. They were identical, of course, except for the thousand and one little details that made them all utterly unique.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you all right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes ma'am.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's your name, and <em class="calibre6">not</em> your number, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nye.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, Nye, here you go.” She handed him her water bottle. Apart from two lightsabers—her own and her dead Master's—her concussion rifle, and her comlink, it was the only item she was carrying. “I have <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> else I can give you. I can't pay you, I can't promote you, I can't give you a few days' R and R, and I can't even decorate you for valor. I'm truly sorry that I can't. And I'm sorry that you're being used like this and I wish I could put an end to it and change your lives for the better. But I can't. All I can do is ask your forgiveness.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Nye seemed stunned. He looked at the bottle and then took a long swig from it, his expression suddenly one of blissful relief. “It's … okay, General. Thank you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was suddenly aware that the hangar deck had fallen completely silent—no mean feat given the vast space and the numbers of men packed in it—and everyone was listening.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The unexpected audience actually made her face burn, and then a little ripple of applause went through the ranks. She wasn't sure if that meant they agreed, or that they were just being supportive of an officer who—now that she had some embarrassing clarity of mind—looked like a walking nightmare and was clearly having trouble dealing with the aftermath of battle.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Caf and a change of clothes, General,” Gett said, looming over her from nowhere. “You'll feel a lot better after a few hours' sleep.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett was a gracious commander and a perfectly competent naval officer. <em class="calibre6">He</em> ran the ship. He was, to all intents and purposes, the commanding officer. She wasn't. And had he been born to a family on Coruscant or Corellia or Alderaan, he would have had a glittering career. But he'd been hatched in a tank on Kamino, and so his artificially shortened life would be very different because of that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">When she got back, she would seek out Kal Skirata and beg him to help her make sense of it all. She would find Omega Squad and tell them face-to-face how much she cared about them before it was too late. She would tell Darman that most of all. She never stopped thinking of him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You meant what you said, General,” Gett said, steering her back toward her cabin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh yes. I did.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm glad. However powerless you feel, solidarity means a great deal to us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She suddenly wanted to see Gett go home to a house full of family and friends, and wondered if she wanted it for him or for herself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was once taught to see while blindfolded,” she said. “It was a far more important lesson than I ever imagined. At the time I thought it was just a way of teaching me to strike with my lightsaber using the Force alone. Now I know what purpose the Force had. I look beyond faces.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you won't change anything by blaming yourself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. You're right. But I won't change anything by pretending I have no responsibility, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">At that point she knew as surely as she had ever known anything that the Force had lifted her from one existence, turned her around, and dropped her on another path. She could <em class="calibre6">change</em> things. She wouldn't change them immediately, and she couldn't change them for any of the men here, but she would somehow change the future for men like this.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If it's any comfort, General, I'm not sure what we'd do if we weren't doing this,” Gett said. “And you do get to hear an awful lot of good jokes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He touched his fingers to his brow and left her at her cabin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They actually found things to laugh about even surrounded by pain and death. Gett had that understated, inventive, and irreverent humor, that seemed common to anyone in uniform: if you couldn't take a joke, apparently, you shouldn't have joined. She'd heard Omega quote that Skirata line more than once. You had to be able to laugh or else the tears would ambush you.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain stared at the dried blood on her robes and, while the memory appalled her, she couldn't bring herself to obliterate it by rinsing it away. She shoved the garment under the mattress of her bunk, shut her eyes, and then didn't even recall lying down.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She woke with a start.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She woke, and <em class="calibre6">then</em> the ship changed course and picked up speed: she felt it. That hadn't woken her. Some disturbance in the Force had.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Darman.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She could feel the very slight vibration that told her <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> drives were straining flat out.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She sat up and swung her legs over the side of the bunk, rubbing a painful cramp from her calves. A clean set of robes was hanging on a peg behind the hatch door of her cabin. She had no idea where the crew had acquired them, but she washed her face in the basin, and looked up at last at the small mirror to see the scratched, ashen, rapidly aging face of a stranger.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But at least she could meet her own eyes now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She pulled on the clean robes and was pocketing both her own lightsaber and Master Kast Fulier's—which she always carried out of sheer sentimentality and pragmatic caution—when there was the sound of boots padding down the passage outside. Someone rapped on the hatch. She eased it open using the Force. It was reassuring to know she wasn't too beaten to do that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General?” Gett said. He handed her a mug of caf, remarkably relaxed for a man whose ship was clearly driven by new urgency. “Sorry to disturb you so soon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's very kind of you, Commander.” She took the caf and saw her hands shaking. “I felt something. What's wrong?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I took a liberty, General. I hope you won't be offended, but I overrode your orders.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She couldn't imagine <em class="calibre6">that</em> ever bothering her. She'd once <em class="calibre6">ordered</em> Darman to do that if he ever felt she was screwing up. The clones knew their trade far better than she ever would.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gett, you know I trust you implicitly?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had a disarming grin, not unlike Fi, but with less of a sense of desperately trying to jolly everyone along. “I've diverted the ship to the Tynna sector. We received a Red Zero call and I thought you'd really want to respond. An extra day or so isn't going to make any difference to the survival rate of casualties now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Red Zero.</em> An emergency command for all vessels to respond to a disaster of some kind, something very serious indeed. Even extracting the Forty-first hadn't been a Red Zero signal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd always give a Red Zero top priority, too. Good call, Gett.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thought you might.” He watched her drain the cup and held out his hand to take it. “Especially because this one's from Omega Squad. They're in very deep dwang, General.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Darman,</em> she thought. The Force always made sure she got the most important intel after all. <em class="calibre6">Dar</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">It was cold and pitch-black in the cockpit, but it certainly beat being dead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi kept his suit temperature at the bare minimum to conserve power. He flicked on his spot-lamp briefly and checked the trussed and shivering suspects who were lying against the deck: a human, and—disturbingly—two Nikto. Fi had only seen Nikto in obscure databases devoted to identifying the best part of their anatomy to aim at to stop them dead. They were <em class="calibre6">tough.</em> Intel said they could defeat Jedi. They were even rumored to have a weapon that could deflect and destroy a lightsaber blade. Maybe Jedi needed to tool up with PEP lasers, then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And all the prisoners had tested positive for explosives residue when Darman had run his sensor over them. With the intel and the heavily encrypted data on their 'pads, the three looked like being <em class="calibre6">dead to rights,</em> as Skirata would say. But it was a long way from being satisfied that they'd snatched the right people to actually extracting useful information from them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi took his thermal plastifoil survival blanket from his backpack and folded it carefully over the human, who seemed to be more affected by cold than the Nikto. Losing a suspect to hypothermia after going to all this trouble to grab them wasn't an option. Wrapping a body wasn't an easy maneuver in zero-g, but at least he'd stopped feeling sick.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The ultralight plastifoil kept drilling away every time the man shuddered. Fi sighed and took out his universal solution to any problem, a roll of thick adhesive tape, and hooked his leg around a handrail to stop himself floating while he tore off lengths. He taped the blanket to the suspect. Then he secured the trussed suspects to the deck with more of the tape. It was <em class="calibre6">amazing</em> how handy tape could be.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And don't ask me to tuck you in and read you a story.” The human just stared balefully at him. He had a lovely black eye now from resisting Darman a little too vigorously. “They never have happy endings.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The man's ID said Farr Orjul but nobody took that too seriously. He was about thirty: fine blond hair, sharp features, very pale blue eyes. The Nikto claimed to be M'truli and Gysk, or at least their mining licenses did, because none of the suspects was talking.</div>

<div class="paragraph">SOPs—standard operating procedures—said they had to stop prisoners from talking to each other before processing. But SOPs hadn't allowed for the little complication of running out of air before an interrogator could be found.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner turned his head slightly to Orjul. “You can talk to us. Or you can wait until Sergeant Vau sits you down with a nice cup of caf and asks you to tell him your life story. He's a good listener. And you'll <em class="calibre6">really</em> want to talk to him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no response. Apart from the brief curses and grunts of pain they'd emitted when Omega stormed the cockpit and <em class="calibre6">subdued</em> them—Fi loved military understatement– none of the suspects had said a single word, not even name, rank, or serial number. And, of course, the two who were dry-frozen somewhere in the vacuum of space weren't going to provide many answers of their own free will, either.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, shall I try to get some information out of these gentlemen just in case the taxi doesn't get here before our air runs out?” Fi asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're not trained to interrogate prisoners,” said Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi maneuvered himself above the human. He didn't know what Nikto felt or feared, and suspected that it wasn't much, but he knew plenty about his own species' vulnerabilities. “I could improvise.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, you'll bounce off the bulkheads, expend too much oxygen, and then we'll have to slot them to preserve the supply for us. It can wait. Vau isn't going anywhere, and neither are they.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner was reclining in the pilot's chair, restraining belt buckled and staring straight ahead. The blue-lit T of his visor was reflected in the transparisteel viewscreen, making him look wonderfully droid-like. Fi wasn't sure if Niner was simply saying coldly brutal things to intimidate the prisoners or not. Fi wasn't entirely sure whether <em class="calibre6">he</em> was really joking some of the time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">War was nothing personal. But somehow Fi felt differently about people who didn't carry a rifle and who didn't kill in honest combat. They were an invisible enemy. Fierfek, even droids stood up where you could see them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He put it out of his mind with a conscious effort, and not only because Ordo had insisted on undamaged prisoners. He knew how to kill, and he knew how to resist pain, but he wasn't sure how to inflict it deliberately.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he was pretty sure that Vau did. He'd leave the job to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman had positioned himself against the bulkhead with his legs stretched out. He looked asleep. Arms folded, head lowered, his point-of-view icon in Fi's HUD showed only an image of his belt and lap. Dar could sleep anywhere, anytime. At one point he flinched, as if someone had said something to him, but there was nothing audible on the comlink.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin, belted in to the copilot's seat, worked on the assortment of datapads, datasticks, and sheets of flimsi that he'd taken from the suspects—dead and alive—and prodded probes into dataports, doing what he seemed to enjoy best: slicing, hacking, and generally dismantling things. Niner occasionally reached out to grab any of his prizes that floated free.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi propelled himself forward with a gentle push against the deck and offered his roll of tape. Atin managed a smile and trapped the wayward components on the sticky side, securing the other end on Niner's left forearm plate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, you know I don't mean it, don't you?” Niner said suddenly. “When I get on your back about stuff. I'm just venting steam.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It took Fi aback. “Sarge, I think the first thing you ever did was to tear me off a strip, and we're still brothers, aren't we? You're just like Sergeant Kal. He never meant any of it, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Did you see the state of him on the hololink?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He looked pretty exhausted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Poor <em class="calibre6">Buir</em>. He never stops worrying.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi paused. It was the first time he'd ever heard Niner use the word <em class="calibre6">buir</em> openly: father. Fi preferred to see everyone burying their fears in wisecracks. This was all too raw.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">We could be dead in two hours. Well, we've been there a few times before …</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He shrugged, desperately seeking the other part of him that always had the smart answer ready. “I don't know about you, <em class="calibre6">vode,</em> but <em class="calibre6">I'm</em> planning on getting back to base because Obrim still owes me a drink.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And your free warra nuts.” So Darman wasn't asleep, then. “Fierfek, I keep getting this weird feeling like someone's here next to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It’s me, Dar. But don’t ask me to hold you hand.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre6">Di’kut</em>.” He unfolded his arms slowly and turned to Atin. “<em class="calibre6">At’ika,</em> if you can’t decrypt that data, why not just try to send the whole memory back down the hololink as is?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That’s what I’m doing,” Atin said without looking up. The only light in the compartment now was the blue glow from their helmets. Fi noted that Atin had his night-vision filter in place to see the small ports on the datapads. “You’re right. I can’t crack the encryption here, but I can dump the data down the link now and let Ordo play with it if I can override the anti-tampering. Otherwise it’ll just delete everything on here. Ten minutes, maybe? I’m not letting this beat me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner eased himself out of the seat and gave Atin a pat on the shoulder as he floated past him. “I’m going to keep the hololink open. Time to update Fleet on our rate of drift anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had nothing to say at the moment. And the link was a power drain that they might regret later if things didn’t pan out quite as they were hoping.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Fi understood. Kal Skirata would be going crazy not being able to keep an eye on them at a time like this. It was what he always, <em class="calibre6">always</em> said when things got tough: <em class="calibre6">I’m here, son.</em> He felt he had to be there for them. And he always had been.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Buir</em> was exactly the right word. Fi had no idea how he had managed to keep faith with more that a hundred commandos.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The link flared into blue light again. Ordo appeared, in full armor and looking away form the cam. He must have been at Fleet HQ, then, to be working with his helmet on like that, and the holo unit must have been placed in his desk.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega here,” Niner said. “Captain, mind if we keep the link open until further notice?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo looked around, and Skirata’s voice cut in from outside the video pickup’s field: “I’d kick your <em class="calibre6">shebs</em> if you didn’t, <em class="calibre6">ad’ike.</em> You okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bored, Sarge,” Said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, you won't be bored much longer. <em class="calibre6">Majestic</em> and <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> are on their way, ETA under two hours—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good old ma'am,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“—but you'll probably have help sooner, because Delta Squad are in transit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, we'll never hear the last of this …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You haven't <em class="calibre6">met</em> them yet, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Heard</em> enough.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Rough, rude boys,” Fi said. “And rather full of themselves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, but they have oxygen, a functioning drive, and they're just gagging to get to you first. So play nicely with them.” Skirata moved into the hololink's visual range and sat down on Ordo's desk, swinging one leg, his injured one. He looked the way he always looked on training exercises: grim, focused, and constantly chewing something. “Oh, and don't open fire. They're driving a Sep ship.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How did they get hold of that? Not that the cannon on this crate is working now anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I don't think the Sep pilot was keen to part with it, but maybe they promised that they'd bring it back when they were finished.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi cut in again. “Anyone looking for Sicko, Sarge? Our TIV pilot?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. We'll keep you posted.” Skirata glanced at Ordo as if he'd said something. “Atin, son, you know Vau's back, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin paused for a second and then carried on tapping a probe on the entrails of a dismantled datapad. He nodded to himself. “Yes, Sarge. I noted that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're coming back to Brigade HQ when we get you out of there, but you steer clear of him, okay? You hear me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was riveted. Atin had never said a word about Vau, other than that he was <em class="calibre6">hard,</em> but his reactions were telling.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He didn't even look toward the holoimage. “I promise, Sarge. Don't worry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll be around to make sure, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin inhaled audibly, a sign that usually meant he was either exasperated or burying his anger. Fi thought better of asking which.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner detached the holo emitter and pickup from his forearm plate, unlatched the small disc from inside the wrist section and stuck it on the flat shelf that ran along the freighter's console with a rolled-up piece of tape. The holoimage of Ordo and Skirata was silent, as was Omega. There was nothing more to discuss. Just having that visual link was enough to comfort everyone.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a long, silent half hour. Maybe Darman slept and maybe he didn't, but Fi suspected he was just thinking. Atin's ten-minute estimate had stretched somewhat but he plowed on, head down, completely focused. <em class="calibre6">Atin</em> was exactly what he was. Not “stubborn,” as Basic translated the word, a negative refusal to change; but <em class="calibre6">atin</em> in the <em class="calibre6">Mando'a</em> sense—courageously persistent, tenacious, the hallmark of a man who would never give up or give in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Eventually he let out a breath. “Sorted.” He leaned forward to connect the dataport to the hololink. “Downloading now. Plus Dar's explosives profiling and some images of the prisoners. Sorry we didn't get pictures of the dead ones, but they wouldn't look too cute now anyway. All yours, Captain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's my boy,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Well, he was now. He wasn't Vau's batch any longer. They all settled back and relaxed as best they could. Fi could hear it in his helmet. They were breathing in unison now, slow and shallow.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo disappeared from the holoimage, no doubt to take the prized data somewhere else to crack it. Skirata simply stayed where he was, occasionally turning to check a screen behind him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">After an hour he spoke again. “Update position and intended movement, Omega. <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> on station in forty-three minutes, <em class="calibre6">Majestic</em> fifty-nine … Delta <em class="calibre6">thirty-five.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're so competitive and macho,” Fi said. “We're going to have to teach them how to relax.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a brief snort of amusement from Darman's audio and then everyone was silent again. The three prisoners shifted from time to time: the human Farr Orjul was shuddering uncontrollably in the cold despite being wrapped like a roasting joint of nerf in all four of the squad's emergency plastifoil blankets. Condensation was forming on the bulkhead next to Fi and he ran his gloved fingertip across it, making the moisture bead and run.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was just as well that the vessel's electrical power was down. It would be shorting out by now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And just when things were going so well—all things considered—Skirata jumped upright from the desk and rushed out of camshot. When he came back seconds later it was clear something had gone <em class="calibre6">osik'la,</em> as he always put it—badly wrong.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega, you've got company. There's a Sep vessel on an intercept course with you, unidentified but armed and going <em class="calibre6">fast.</em> Have you <em class="calibre6">any</em> power at all you can divert to cannon? Are you certain it's offline?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner swallowed hard. The problem with a shared helmet comlink was that you heard your brother's every reaction, even the ones you really didn't want to. It was one reason why they checked each other's biosign readouts only when they had to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We blew all the power relays to trigger the emergency bulkheads, Sarge. It's dead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused for a heartbeat. “Their ETA at that speed is thirty-five minutes. <em class="calibre6">Ad'ike,</em> I'm sorry—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's okay, Sarge,” Niner said. He sounded flat calm now. “Just tell Delta not to stop for caf, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's adrenaline flooded his mouth with a familiar tingling sensation, and a great cold wash of ice flowed into his leg muscles.</div>

<div class="paragraph">You couldn't defend yourself against cannon with a DC-17, not in a sealed and crippled section of a slowly drifting ship. Fi hadn't found himself helpless for a long time. He knew he wasn't going to handle it well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman looked up suddenly. He hadn't reacted at all to the grim news until then. He turned to face Fi, just a ghostly blue T-shaped light on the other side of the cockpit.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't want to throw any more cold water on this party,” he said. “But has anyone thought through the logical sequence of this extraction? Because I bet Delta has …”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RAS </strong><strong class="calibre11"><em class="calibre6">Fearless</em>, time to </strong><strong class="calibre11">target: twenty minutes</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Commander Gett leaned over the ops room trooper, the one he called Peewo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It had taken Etain a while to realize that he called all the men who took watches at that console <em class="calibre6">Peewo;</em> it was simply an acronym for “principal weapons officer.” The man's name was actually Tenn.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Tenn's face was blank with total concentration, thrown into sharp relief by the yellow light from the screens in front of him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There it is,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Separatist ship—appearing on the tracking screen as a visibly shifting red pulse—was now within their scanning range. Omega's wasn't, although Tenn had programmed in a blue marker that corresponded with their last position and projected drift.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How many minutes are we still behind them?” Etain asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If Tenn didn't like having a commander and a general breathing down his neck, he showed no sign of it. Etain admired his ability to ignore distractions, even without a little Force help from her. He didn't seem to need it. “Five, maybe four if the velocities hold constant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now, what's that?” Gett said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A smaller target had appeared on the screen, first red, then blue, then flashing red with a cursor saying UNCONFIRMED.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sep drive profile, but the scan is probably detecting a GAR encrypted transponder,” Tenn said. “I think we can guess who's in the driver's seat there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Wasn't Delta carrying out a rummage of <em class="calibre6">Prosecutor?”</em> Gett asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I gather they had expected visitors.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Doesn't Delta file full contact reports?” Etain interrupted.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No more detail than they have to, I understand,” Gett said. “Silent ops. I think they get out of the habit of talking to the regular forces side of things. Perhaps General Jusik might have a word with them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta, like Omega, was part of Jusik's battalion, Zero Five Commando, which was one of ten in the Special Operations Brigade commanded by Etain's former Master, Arligan Zey. A year before, there had been two brigades; casualties had slashed their strength in half.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And like all the commando squads, Delta was utterly self-reliant and operated largely without command, merely receiving intelligence support and a broad objective. It was the kind of command that was ideal for a very smart but inexperienced general. And there was no other way for one Jedi to run five hundred special forces men: clones led clones, as they did in the regular GAR. So Delta did more or less as they pleased within the overall battle plan. Fortunately, it seemed to please them to be blisteringly efficient, a quality Etain noted and respected in every clone soldier she met.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get me a link to them, Commander,” she said. “I need to talk to them. As do you, I have no idea how they're going to play this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett just raised his eyebrows and turned to the signals officer to request a secure link via Fleet. It took thirty seconds. They were eighteen minutes to target. Time was running out. Tenn moved his seat a little so Gett could place the hololink transmitter on the console where they could see both the link and the tracking screen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta, this is General Tur-Mukan, <em class="calibre6">Fearless.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The image that shimmered before her showed one man in a familiar suit of Katarn armor, squatting with a DC-17 across his thighs. The blue light distorted natural color, but the dark patches on his armor suggested red or orange identity markings.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“RC-one-one-three-eight, General, receiving.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was time for names. “You're <em class="calibre6">Boss.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, General, Boss. Our ETA is fourteen to fifteen minutes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't have any armament, do you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, and we're aware that there's another Sep ship right up our <em class="calibre6">shebs</em> that <em class="calibre6">does.”</em> Boss appeared to check himself. “Apologies for the language, General. But you're the ones carrying the cannon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Boss, how do you plan to execute this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get there first, get them out fast, and bug out even faster. That usually works pretty well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She bristled, but she knew that wasn't fair to him. “Could you be more specific?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, we get alongside, access the cockpit, seal against vacuum, and extract personnel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Access means a big bang, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. Scorch would usually love that, but this is a cutting job if you want those prisoners alive because that'll mean an instant decompression. If you <em class="calibre6">don't</em> want them alive, then that's easier. Omega has enough air, so their suits are still good for another twenty minutes in vacuum. In that case we just blow the cockpit viewscreen and haul them out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss had his helmet cocked slightly to one side as if he was asking her to make a command decision. He <em class="calibre6">was.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the mission objective versus Omega's safety.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And that's what command is all about.</em> Etain suspected this was where she finally stopped playing at being a general.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Omega didn't have to survive, but a few terrorists who might hold the key to a wider terror network <em class="calibre6">did.</em> Accessing the cockpit carefully with cutting equipment would take more time, time that might mean the Sep ship arrived before Omega was safe and clear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Her personal choice was immediate. But she wavered over the professional one. She was aware of Gett glancing at her and then looking down at something of overwhelming interest on the deck.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss showed unusual diplomacy for a squad that had a name for being unsubtle. He wasn't blind. He could see her as well as she could see him, and he probably saw a child out of her depth.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General, I've spoken to Niner,” he said. “He's clear. They're <em class="calibre6">all</em> clear. This is as close as we've come to grabbing some key players for a long, long time, and it probably cost their pilot his life as well. We <em class="calibre6">have</em> to make prisoner retrieval the priority. We all know the game by now. It's a risk for us, too. We might <em class="calibre6">all</em> get vaped.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know you're correct,” Etain said. “But none of you is expendable as far as I'm concerned. And I know you'll do everything you can to get them out alive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General, is that an order, and if so, <em class="calibre6">what is it?</em> Extract Omega and abandon the prisoners? Or what?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She felt her stomach fall. It was relatively easy to be the commander who held a trooper as he was dying. It was much, much harder to stand there and say <em class="calibre6">Yes, rescue three terrorists and let my friends die—let Darman die—if that's what it takes.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Had they asked Skirata? What did <em class="calibre6">he</em> say?</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett touched her arm and indicated the tracking screen. He held up three fingers. <em class="calibre6">Three minutes behind the Sep vessel now.</em> They were gaining on them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Extract the prisoners,” Etain said. It was out of her mouth before she could think further. “And we'll be right behind you.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Unnamed commercial freighter, </strong><strong class="calibre11">drifting three thousand klicks Core-side</strong><strong class="calibre11">of Perlemian node: </strong><strong class="calibre11">Red Zero first responder ETA six minutes</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Fi studied his datapad and considered his brief and busy one-year career as an elite commando.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd fought at Geonosis. He'd taken out a Sep research base, nearly slotted his beloved Sergeant Kal, and ended the careers of eighty-five assorted Seps and more droids than he bothered to count. And he'd denied the CIS an awful lot of assets, from replenishment depots to a capital ship and a fighter squadron that didn't even have the chance to fly its first sortie.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Some of it had been fun, most of it had been a grim hard slog, and all of it had been frightening. And now the cheerful euphemism was over; he was probably going to die. And he didn't want Skirata to witness that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He looked up from the expired op orders on his datapad and saw that the holoimage of Skirata was still much as it had been for the best part of two hours. Sergeant Kal waited. He wouldn't leave.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner continued to stare out the viewscreen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he sat bolt upright, prevented from shooting forward by the restraining belt. Fi checked his viewpoint icon and saw he had activated his electrobinocular visor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Visual contact,” Niner said quietly. “Fierfek, it really <em class="calibre6">is</em> a Sep crate. Neimoidian.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The whole squad maneuvered so they could see what he was looking at.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“About time,” Niner said. Fi listened in. “Delta, Niner here. You been sightseeing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Boss receiving. Sorry, we had to stop and ask for directions.” He had a voice very like Atin's but with a stronger accent. “My boys are now going to show you how to do an extraction <em class="calibre6">properly,</em> so take notes because you might blink and miss it. There's a Sep ship with missiles up the spout about three minutes behind us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can we bring some friends?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The more the merrier. We're going to align with your cockpit, slap an isolation seal on the viewport, and Scorch will cut through. Then you shift it fast, and we RV with <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> for caf, cakes, and hero worship. Got it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I love emotional reunions,” Fi said. “And hero worship.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Boss, that Sep's getting awfully close.” Another voice: Fi couldn't identify any of them yet. “This might have to beat the galactic record.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“How</em> close? Close enough to make me mad?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They could launch a missile in two minutes and it'd singe your <em class="calibre6">shebs</em> overtaking us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. <em class="calibre6">Close.</em> Omega, you heard the man.” Boss sounded unperturbed. “Powder your noses and get ready to party.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek,</em> Fi thought. He rolled carefully to peel Orjul off the deck and haul him upright for a hasty exit with jet-pack assist.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The human prisoner looked straight at him. And he <em class="calibre6">spoke.</em> “You're really not very good at this, are you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Now</em> you decide to get chatty.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll all be charcoal in a few minutes, and that gives me some satisfaction.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, I'm now <em class="calibre6">really</em> motivated to introduce you to Sergeant Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoa, cut it out,” Darman said. One of the Nikto tried to gore him with its short horns as he lifted it ready for escape. “Ungrateful <em class="calibre6">di'kut.”</em> He brought his helmet hard down in its face in a perfect head-butt; only the pilot's seat stopped them from being catapulted by the inertia of the impact. Darman looked around at the other Nikto. “Want some?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Udesii,</em> boys, <em class="calibre6">udesii.”</em> Niner raised his Deece. “Push comes to shove, we only need one of them alive, so next one to look like a safety risk isn't going home. Okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The small Neimoidian assault vessel now filled their field of vision as it came to nestle partly across the freighter's viewscreen. Fi watched, mesmerized. A hatch opened and something distressingly reminiscent of a wide mouthed worm emerged and sucked against the transparisteel. A familiar blue light loomed from the darkness of its maw. Through the plate, Fi saw a helmet very like his and an exaggerated thumbs-up gesture.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand back and watch a pro at work,” said a disembodied voice on the comlink.</div>

<div class="paragraph">For a second Fi thought Scorch was attaching a frame charge. <em class="calibre6">Yeah, that's. clever, I don't think.</em> But the large ring of alloy pipe sat snugly on the plate and began to glow white-hot. Scorch's thumbs-up became a jerked <em class="calibre6">move away</em> gesture.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Scorch, sooner rather than later, okay?” Boss's voice said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One minute, tops.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We haven't <em class="calibre6">got</em> a minute—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What d'you want me to do, chew through it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The transparisteel plate was distorting as the hot frame burned through from the outside. Niner gathered up the hololink and snapped it back on his forearm plate. Atin shoved datapads and tools in his belt.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell you what, shall we just float here and panic incoherently while we're waiting?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good idea,” Scorch said, unmoved.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Very</em> good idea, panicking,” Boss said. “Guess what I just eyeballed from the port-side screen.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RAS </strong><strong class="calibre11"><em class="calibre6">Fearless, </em></strong><strong class="calibre11">ops room, ETA to target: two minutes</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The assault ship had to decelerate to drop from hyperspace and open fire. It cost critical time. Etain watched while Tenn made rapid calculations to see if they could find that single critical firing solution that balanced losing speed with firing missiles and would not only make up those seconds, but also take out the Sep ship before it had a chance to target Omega.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The ops room was crowded with white armor and yet utterly silent as <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> crew watched the tracking screen repeater on the bulkhead. It mirrored what Tenn, Gett, and Etain could see in smaller format at the PWO's station.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Tenn didn't seem to have blinked in the last three minutes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Firing solution, General.” His hand rested on the firing key, his gaze welded to the screen. “Target acquired. Best solution we're going to get and our window is ten seconds or we'll take out Omega and Delta, too. Now, General?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain glanced at Gett, her mind partly sensing the ripples in the Force. And the Force agreed with Tenn, to the very second.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Take it, Tenn.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, ma'am.” The key made a small snipping noise as he depressed it. “Fire <em class="calibre6">one,</em> fire <em class="calibre6">two.</em> Missiles away—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Two huge trails of savage energy sped away from the decelerating assault ship and into the void. Etain could feel too much imminent disaster in the Force: she didn't want to watch it as well. She cupped her hands over her nose and shut her eyes for a second, and then made herself look back at the screen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The tracking screen followed the missiles as steady white lines. They looked as if they had overlapped the pulsing red point of light that was the Separatist fighter. All the traces winked out of existence at the same time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Splash one,” said a trooper at another station. “Visual confirmation. Target destroyed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And who else?” Commander Gett asked.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Whoaaaa … !”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi wasn't certain if it was his own cry of shock or Scorch's voice in his comlink, but he saw the ball of white-and-gold flame expanding toward them, silhouetting the section of Neimie ship that partly obscured the shield, and he ducked instinctively.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A hailstorm of debris rained on the screen. Something large and metallic skidded along the casing of the freighter with a long dull screech. Fi straightened up as the hammering faded to the occasional rattle, like stones being tossed onto a roof. Then it stopped completely.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Scorch said. “Now, if they'd only added a spot of maranium to the warhead, it would have burned a really pretty <em class="calibre6">purple.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Fearless Fearless Fearless</em> calling Delta. Are you clear, repeat, are you clear, respond.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">A large rectangle of hot softened glass peeled slowly away from the screen, helped by Scorch's fist, and drifted off serenely into a silent, slow-motion collision with the headrest of the pilot's seat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta here, <em class="calibre6">Fearless.</em> Just extracting Omega and cargo now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi fought to stop himself from sounding breathless and shaky. It would let the squad down. “I'm glad the navy's here,” he said. “Because if it had been down to you, Greased Lightning, we'd be an asteroid belt by now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch's visor poked through the aperture at last, followed by his arm, and he made an unmistakable gesture of displeasure.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi felt his mouth take over, fueled by shock. “My hero! You finally made it!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You want to walk back to base?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner lifted the plastifoil-wrapped Orjul with one hand and lined him up with the opening. “Fi's going to give his mouth a nice rest now and help me cross-deck the garbage.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gift-wrapped? Aww, you <em class="calibre6">shouldn't</em> have.” Scorch hauled himself a little farther down the access tube and hung motionless at 135 degrees, assessing the three bound prisoners. “Feet first, please. Then if the <em class="calibre6">di'kut</em> tries to kick out I can break his legs. Don't want this tubing breached.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It proved harder than expected. But by the time the second Nikto had been rammed up into the connecting tube like a torpedo, the warm air from the hijacked Neimoidian vessel had worked its way into the freighter cockpit and made Fi feel a lot more comfortable. He stood back to let Atin then Darman make their way up the tube.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch hauled Darman inboard by his webbing. Fi waited for his boots to disappear and then rolled to peer up the aperture into a circle of dim light.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Next!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi lined up and then pushed off with one boot. As he passed through the open hatch at the other end, he felt artificial gravity seize him, and he rolled onto the deck with a clatter of armor plates. It took him a few seconds to get to his feet. Niner collided with him from behind. It wasn't a very big ship.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss—his armor daubed with chipped and peeling orange paint—slammed the hatch behind Niner and sealed it. Niner stared at him as if he wasn't sure what should happen next and then the two men simply shook hands and slapped each other on the back.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like what we've done with the place?” Boss said, taking off his helmet. The flight deck looked as if someone had been dismantling it the hard way: panels had been ripped out, wires hung from the deckhead, and there were empty slots in the console where units had either been removed or not installed in the first place. “Okay, perhaps it's a little basic, but we call it home.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre6">nicked</em> this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, they let us take it on a test drive.” Boss gestured at the rest of his brightly painted squad. “Fixer, Sev, and you already know Scorch. Say hello to the boys in boring black.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, <em class="calibre6">vode,”</em> Fi said. He wondered why Atin wasn't joining in; he had turned away and seemed to be taking a technical interest in a run of conduit. “Any word on Sicko?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If that's your pilot, <em class="calibre6">Majestic's</em> been diverted now. They picked up his beacon and that's all we know.” Boss looked down at the three prisoners, lined up on the deck like corpses. He gave each of them a nudge with his boot. “You'd better be worth everyone's effort.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi eased off his helmet and inhaled almost fresh air. Except for Scorch, they had all taken off their helmets. Delta was one of fewer than a dozen squads that had survived intact since decanting, a true <em class="calibre6">pod</em> as the Kaminoans had called it, and they seemed to think that made them an elite within an elite. They had been raised and trained together, and they had never fought with anyone but their brothers. It was a luxury few squads now enjoyed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi suspected it meant they didn't play well with others. He remembered only too well how ferociously competitive and inward looking his own pod had been, and how badly his confidence had been dented when he lost his brothers at Geonosis and was then dumped in Niner's care.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You do okay for a mongrel squad,” Sev said, and Fi chose not to react. He knew he was on autopilot now and that he should shut up. Niner's glance helped him decide. “I don't suppose you did a rummage on that ship, did you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not with a rapid decompression on our hands, no,” said Niner. “Word was that it was carrying explosives.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, we're going to be coated in Seps anytime now, so let's get this crate into <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> hangar and then they can blow the freighter. If there's anything useful in it, at least the Seps don't get it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman slid down a bulkhead onto the deck, and Niner sat down beside him. They were nearly back aboard <em class="calibre6">Fearless,</em> and that meant they were nearly home, and home meant Arca Company Barracks and—at last—a good night's sleep after two months on patrol. Fi never got enough. None of them ever did. And fatigue could make you dangerously careless.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So, Atin … ,” Sev said. He wandered up behind Atin and stood close enough to be annoying. Atin didn't turn around. “Sargent Vau asked to see you again, <em class="calibre6">vod'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not your <em class="calibre6">little brother,”</em> Atin said quietly. He kept his back to Sev. “I just work with you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ah, so there <em class="calibre6">was</em> some history between those two. Fi bristled: he rallied to his adopted brother. He could see that the prospect of actually meeting Vau again was stoking something inside that wasn't typically Atin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev didn't let up. “I don't forget, you know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">This time Atin <em class="calibre6">did</em> wheel around, face-to-face with Sev, so close that Fi thought his placid brother was actually going to lose it for once. He prepared to intervene.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's my business,” Atin said. “Stay out of it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev stared into his face. “And disagreements stay <em class="calibre6">inside</em> the company.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin hooked his fingers in the neck of his bodysuit and yanked it down to the left as far as the edge of the armor, exposing his collarbone. He had a lot of raised white scars. Nobody took much notice of them because injuries in training and combat were so common that they rarely drew comment. “You got worse than that, did you? You spent a week in bacta, <em class="calibre6">did you?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin looked about to snap, and Fi stepped forward to intervene. Then Niner was across the cabin in three strides and slammed in between the two men. He had to break them up by putting his arms between them and knocking them apart with his arm plates. But Sev's unblinking gaze was still fixed on Atin as if Niner weren't there.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think we all need to reach a comradely understanding,” Niner said, blocking Sev with his body. “Back at the barracks, if that's okay with you, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev looked murderous. His eyes were still fixed on Atin's. “Anytime, <em class="calibre6">vod'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you two can shut it <em class="calibre6">now.</em> And you, Fi. Stand down. We've all had a bad day, so let's throttle back on the testosterone and play nicely.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev held his hands away from his sides in a gesture of reluctant submission and went to sit beside Scorch in the cockpit. Boss didn't say a word, but Niner grabbed Fi and Atin by their shoulders and shoved them farther away.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're going to tell me what that's all about.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I'm not, Sarge. It's personal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's no <em class="calibre6">personal</em> where this squad is concerned. Later, okay? I'm not having you brawling like a pair of civvies. If there's a needle match between you two, we <em class="calibre6">all</em> sort it together. Got it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner emphasized his warning with a prod in Atin's chest and moved back to stand with Boss while Scorch brought the vessel alongside <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> and began negotiating with the flight deck controller on how they might make space in the hangar for it. Fi waited with Atin in case he decided to resume his little chat with Sev. He had never seen Atin flare up even under the most extreme pressure, but he seemed ready to swing at anyone now. And even a brain-dead Weequay could have spotted that it had something to do with Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“At'ika,</em> you want to tell me about it sometime?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not really.” Atin patted Fi on the shoulder. “I have to deal with it myself sooner or later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi glanced at Sev and got a blank stare that wasn't even hostility, just an absence of anything comradely. It wasn't going to be a bundle of laughs if they ever had to work together again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi hadn't thought he would get on with Niner on first meeting, either. But there had never been anything about Niner that had made Fi want to punch him in the face and get it over with, just to save time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was going to happen, sooner or later. Fi <em class="calibre6">knew</em> it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd never had a disagreement, let alone a fight, with a brother before. It made him uneasy. He distracted himself with dreams of a hot shower, hot food, and the luxury of five hours' unbroken sleep.</div>

<div class="paragraph">From: CO <em class="calibre6">Majestic,</em> off Kelarea: 367 days after Geonosis.</div>

<div class="paragraph">I regret to inform you that we have recovered the wreckage of TIV Z590/1 and the body of pilot CT-1127/549. Perlemian Traffic Control reports that Republic civilian freighter <em class="calibre6">Nova Crystal</em> logged that it fired on a vessel it described as a “pirate” attacking its convoy to dislodge it from the hull. I also regret that due to security restrictions, I am unable to tell PTC that-the freighter killed a special forces pilot on active service, and so PTC regard <em class="calibre6">Nova Crystal's</em> skipper to be something of a hero.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Fleet Ops HQ, Coruscant,</strong><strong class="calibre11">0600, 368 days after Geonosis: </strong><strong class="calibre11">the first anniversary of the battle</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata walked out of the Fleet Ops lobby and into a cool, moist morning that he wasn't expecting to welcome.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was over, for the time being. Omega had survived, and they were coming home. They needed a break from continuous deployment in the badlands and he was certain they were needed here. CSF couldn't handle a big terror operation in the capital system, not even with Obrim around.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The question was how to work that past Arligan Zey. The Jedi was reluctant to commit men to what he saw as security work at a time like this.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But it was what Ordo and the Nulls were ideally suited for—if they had a few commandos to deploy as well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood on the steps for a few minutes inhaling fresh air, eyes stinging from fatigue, and raked his fingers through his crew cut. He could sleep now. Omega was safe; Ordo was here with him; and his five brothers were accounted for, safe and well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel was on Kamino. If Zey was heard to mutter that the Nulls were Skirata's private army, he wasn't entirely wrong.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There were still ninety of the men Skirata had trained from small boys on active service, and he worried about them, too. But Omega had become as much his closest family now as the Null ARCs. He would move the galaxy for them if he had to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The gold-veined marble fountain in the center of the plaza beckoned to him. He stopped as he walked past it and simply leaned over and plunged his head in the icy water, holding it there for a few painfully refreshing moments before jerking upright and shaking the water off like a mott.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A couple of early-morning pedestrians stared at him and he returned the stare until they looked away. It was rare for anyone to even notice him: he made a habit of being inconspicuous. But today he didn't care. Did they have <em class="calibre6">any</em> idea what was going on around the galaxy on hundreds of battlefields? He resisted the urge to grab them, shake them, and make them listen to what was happening in their name.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the first anniversary of Geonosis. Nobody seemed to be marking that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo walked up behind him. “You should get some rest, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll sleep when <em class="calibre6">you</em> sleep.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have more good news.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I could do with that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Darman's explosives profile. The reading from the prisoners matches up with the manufacturing characteristics of at least a quarter of the devices detonated so far. We got a break.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good work. And good old Dar.” He smiled at Ordo, reminded again of how well his boys had turned out. “Tell you what, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika,</em> fancy some breakfast while the system gets on with unpacking that data? They do a disgustingly greasy fry-up in the Kragget. It's not the Skysitter, but it sets you up for the day.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo shrugged and tilted his head in a conspicuously self-conscious glance down at his spotless white armor. “I don't think we're the Skysitter's type of clientele, anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata couldn't see the expression behind the visor, but he knew Ordo was amused. It was good that a man who'd had an unimaginable nightmare of a childhood could find anything funny. “They have napkins. And I'll try not to splash sauce over you. Deal? Just to celebrate the fact that we're both still here a year on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo started walking. “What were you doing a year ago today?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Wondering where all my boys had gone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> It was a <em class="calibre6">very</em> rapid deployment. I should have woken you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You did fine. I should have shaped up and realized you had a job to do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We certainly accounted for a number of enemy positions,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I never said good-bye to the lads who didn't come back, that's all. I lost nine out of my batch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But the last time you saw them, you left them feeling confident, respected, and loved. That's enough for any <em class="calibre6">buir</em> to achieve.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, son.” <em class="calibre6">How did he ever grow up this normal?</em> “Let's enjoy ourselves for a change, shall we?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">For a few brief hours Skirata and Ordo did what normal civilians did and took an Easy Ride to the city's lower levels to have a dangerously unhealthy but comforting breakfast.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had never used public transport with Ordo in tow before, and the reactions of other passengers fascinated him. They sneaked sideways glances. Ordo's custom holster with its twin blasters probably focused them somewhat. The ARC trooper armor was spectacular even in a city jaded by the everyday presence of a thousand exotic species.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata regularly forgot how few of the capital's civilians had ever seen a clone soldier face-to-face. Apart from the heavily publicized display of massed GAR battalions boarding assault ships at the military staging area a year ago, the vast majority of Coruscanti had no contact with them whatsoever.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And <em class="calibre6">never</em> without their helmets.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Ord'ika,”</em> he whispered. “Do me a favor. Take off your bucket, will you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo paused for a moment and then popped the seal on his collar and lifted off his helmet. Skirata kept an eye on the other passengers' reactions. It was a revelation. Some looked blankly surprised. Others went a little farther.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh no, they're <em class="calibre6">human!”</em> one man whispered. “And they're so <em class="calibre6">young!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Did anyone know <em class="calibre6">how</em> young? He hated using Ordo like this, but it had to be done. Skirata, tired and permanently irritable, bit back his retort and became a diplomat for a few moments.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No sir, the war isn't droids fighting droids,” he said. “May I introduce Captain Ordo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo nodded politely at the man in the seat across the aisle and extended his hand; Skirata had taught his little Nulls to act like nice boys when they needed to. The man hesitated and then reached across to shake Ordo's hand, surrendering soft pale civilian fingers to a black gauntlet. The look on his face said clearly that he hadn't expected to find flesh and blood inside the droid-like shell, or to retrieve his hand un-crushed afterward.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My pleasure, sir,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was unusually quiet in the EasyRide after that. At least the reality had registered on them. Skirata nudged Ordo to get off when they reached the Kragget level, and the ARC replaced his helmet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You like to shock,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I like to <em class="calibre6">educate,”</em> said Skirata. “Sorry, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Strolling around Coruscant with a fully armored ARC captain was hardly blending in, but it got him a good table in the Kragget, which meant one that the service droid actually wiped clean before they sat down. A couple of CFS officers acknowledged them. Police and security officers liked eating here because it was right on the edge of their “manor,” as some of them called the rough territory where they plied their trade, handy for a quick response to a call but far enough away to be a haven.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took his helmet off again to tuck into the plate of fried smoked nerf slices. The eggs were from something Skirata couldn't identify and knew he didn't want to. He concentrated on the seductively unctuous sensation of hot fat and salty yolk in his mouth and washed it down with several cups of caf.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We can't leave this to the boys in blue any longer,” Skirata said. They both knew what <em class="calibre6">this</em> was without being specific in a public place. “They're hampered by having to do stuff by the book, and we don't know if they're all playing for our team anyway. This is one for <em class="calibre6">us.</em> I'm going to make Zey see sense about it. Once everyone's back in town, it'll be a lot harder for him to say no.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If the cryptography droid extracts some relevant data from Atin's little haul, it might be even harder.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Which reminds me. I haven't paid my respects to Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Promise me you won't pull your knife on him again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll behave.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The server droid seemed to have been replaced by a female Twi'lek waitress, who looked past prime dancing age but who still distracted Skirata for a second or two. She put another plate of nerf strips in front of Ordo, who—like every clone soldier Skirata had ever known—would eat anything and everything put in front of him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She smiled and lingered. Ordo froze and returned the smile in the nervous way of a small boy, then busied himself with his breakfast and the waitress moved away.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reflected on the careless power of youth and looks, and how incomplete a teacher he had been of social skills. “Somehow I don't think <em class="calibre6">she's</em> mistaken you for a droid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo looked uncharacteristically flustered for a moment. “Er … I've been assessing our requirements.” He cleared his plate again, and Skirata slid his unwanted eggs onto the man's plate and watched them disappear. “Kit is an issue. We need to discuss this before you see Zey. This is going to take some serious resources—vehicles, safe houses, special surveillance equipment, and ordnance?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had been doing the calculations at the same time Ordo had.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They'd need two squads, at least, and a couple of Nulls. But two squads of Republic Commandos in their distinctively bulky, bad-boy Katarn Mark III kit and Ordo and Mereel in their spectacular red and blue would be <em class="calibre6">noticeable</em> as unusual activity.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They might need to wear that armor sooner or later, even if they could be deployed in civilian clothing the rest of the time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata chewed the last overdone piece of smoked nerf he saved the delectable crunchy bits for last—and a solution blossomed as his jaw worked.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Hide in plain sight.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He was good at that. He could become so mundane—unkempt hair, scruffy clothing—that he was almost invisible. And so could his lads, by being the opposite.</div>

<div class="paragraph">All they had to do was be one of <em class="calibre6">a number of</em> clone personnel wandering around Coruscant in full armor. And if occasionally they took off that armor and went about in fatigues, then who would really recognize them as individuals?</div>

<div class="paragraph">They all looked the same to most people, other than a few Jedi who cared about them as men, and their own brothers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata considered it a <em class="calibre6">very</em> productive working breakfast.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He opened his comlink and keyed a meeting request to General Zey. Then he leaned across the table, seized Ordo two-handed by his shoulder pauldron, and gave him a noisy and exaggerated paternal kiss on the top of his head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorted!” he said. <em class="calibre6">“Plain sight!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The Twi'lek waitress watched, fascinated. “Hey, can I try that, too?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's just a boy,” Skirata said, and left her a very generous tip. Ordo got up to follow him, pocketing a couple of meal-bread sticks for later. “My son.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RAS <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> hangar deck</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Good grief, here comes the armored division,” said Commander Gett. He strode toward the Neimoidian vessel. Its casing was streaked and pocked with scorch marks. “RCs look like <em class="calibre6">tanks,</em> don't they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Republic Commandos did look fearsomely bulky alongside the clone troopers. The first four to clamber out of the seized Trade Federation craft were a riot of color, their battered armor daubed with green, yellow, red, and orange markings.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The second squad was armored in matte black, utterly featureless and grim. But Etain knew instantly who they were and which man was which. She needed no battle livery to distinguish them: their forms in the Force were almost like trails of phosphorescence in a tropical ocean, and they were instantly familiar, instantly old friends.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I was only with them for a few days and I haven't seen or talked to them for months. But it's as if we were never apart.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi—oh yes, she knew it was Fi even before he spoke—saluted, lifted his helmet, and winked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ma'am, you look like the back end of a bantha,” he said sympathetically. “Are they looking after you properly here?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi!” She knew she was supposed to remain dignified and aloof, and she'd felt comradeship with many clone troopers in the intervening months, but her first reluctant command with Omega had utterly changed her. “Fi, I've really missed you. What happened to the gray armor?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know how much Dar griped about being too visible on Qiilura. Anyway, he's brought you a present.” He gestured over his shoulder. Darman was helping a group of troopers haul the prisoners out of the Neimoidian landing craft while Gett examined it. “They're all in one piece, too. We've been really good boys this time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta Squad had simply disappeared. When Etain looked around, she saw they had settled in a tight knot in a corner of the hangar deck, helmets on, obviously talking intently. She knew the body language now. They didn't feel like Omega in the Force at all. They were a concentrated well, a bottomless pool of something unyielding, and totally enmeshed with each other. The general impression they made on the Force was one of triumphant high spirits.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner and Atin approached and clasped hands with her. It didn't feel at all inappropriate. They looked tired and anxious, and she wanted very badly to make things right for them. They were her friends.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I bet you'd like something to eat,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Any chance of a hot shower and a few hours' sleep first, please, General?” Niner looked apologetic and shoved Fi gently in the back. “Me first. I'm pulling rank.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's not <em class="calibre6">really</em> a sergeant, General,” said Fi. “He just helps them out when they're busy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Any news on our pilot?” Niner asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. I'm so sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was never easy. She tapped her datapad to bring up the copy of the signal that <em class="calibre6">Majestic</em> had sent to Fleet and handed the 'pad to him. Niner glanced at it, blinked, and passed it to Fi. Fi parted his lips briefly as if to say something, and then his slight frown almost crumpled into grief. He composed himself and just looked down at the deck.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's not the first,” Fi said, suddenly grim, and Etain had never seen that aspect of him surface visibly before. “And he won't be the last.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain watched them disappear through a hatch on the aft bulkhead, trailing after a trooper. <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> shivered slightly under the soles of her boots, making top speed back to Coruscant, and she waited while Darman spent what seemed like an interminable time fussing about with the prisoner hand-over. She wondered if he was reluctant to talk after choosing not to remain on Qiilura with her. Perhaps he was just concerned that nothing else went wrong.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She gave up waiting and walked carefully between the troopers still trying to catch some sleep on the hangar deck, curled up wherever they could find a relatively comfortable space.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well done,” she said, hoping that some were awake to hear her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman had changed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He bent his head to ease off his helmet, popping the seal, and then shook his hair and smoothed it flat with one glove. And although he smiled, he wasn't the Darman she had been through hell with.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He looked older.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Clones aged faster than normal men. He was eleven going on twenty-two going on—fifty. When she had first sensed him as a child in the Force, his square, high-cheekboned face had been both man and boy, at the stage of life when—had she been able to manipulate time—the slightest push backward would have revealed the child he had so recently been. But now he was a man, quite solidly, and with no hint of the boy about him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wasn't simply that he had aged two years in one. The look in his eyes said he was much, much older, as old as the battlefield, maybe as old as war itself. She had seen it in the face of every clone trooper and commando and ARC she had commanded. She knew that she had that same look, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Darman smiled anyway, and the smile broadened into a grin that made the rest of the ship—even the galaxy—utterly irrelevant to her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You always cut it fine, don't you, ma'am?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's good to see you, Dar. Whatever happened to <em class="calibre6">Etain?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“She turned into a general and we're on the hangar deck.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're right. I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is it definitely confirmed that we're going back to base?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Unless you want to argue with the officer of the watch, I believe so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good. We need a break. Just a day or two, maybe.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He never did ask for much. None of them did: she wondered if they didn't know what the world had to offer them or if they were just honed down to basic needs, too overwhelmed to think beyond recovering enough to do the job over again the next day.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She patted his armored shoulder and held her hand there for a few seconds. He looked as if he suddenly remembered something and was embarrassed by it in a way he quite enjoyed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It must be nice to be able to reach out to someone through the Force,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So he'd felt it. She was glad.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get yourself off to the 'freshers,” she said. “Come and find me afterward if you're not too tired, and I'll show you over the ship.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Have you met Sergeant Kal yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No.” <em class="calibre6">Kal</em> was always there for Darman, somewhere, even at times like this when she wanted to say so much to him. “When we dock, perhaps you could introduce me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman beamed, clearly delighted. “Oh, you'll like him, General. You'll really <em class="calibre6">like</em> him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain certainly hoped so. And if she didn't, then she'd try, for Darman's sake.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">SO BrigadeHQ, Coruscant, 369 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The smell hit Ordo long before he reached the meeting room. It was a familiar blend of wet wool, mold, and a pungent oily musk.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reacted visibly. He straightened his right arm by his side out of old, old habit and let the blade slide into his hand, fall a fraction until the handle touched his palm, and then snatched it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kal'buir,</em> it would be better if I <em class="calibre6">shot</em> it,” Ordo said. He put a restraining hand on Skirata's arm. “I won't let it near you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've often wondered if you're telepathic, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can smell the strill, you have your knife ready, and we're meeting Sergeant Vau. Telepathy isn't required to work that one out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo would have been quite content to shoot the strill without a second thought because it upset <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> But it wasn't the strill's fault that it stank, or that it had a master who cherished cruelty, or that it had become savage itself. It had been selected by nature and then trained by people to hunt for pleasure rather than for food, and nothing else had ever been allowed to cross its mind.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He felt some pity for it. But he would still kill it without a moment's hesitation.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The doors slid back. Ordo placed his right hand discreetly on the grip of one of his repeating blasters. His attention went instinctively to Vau, then to the strill lying on his lap, and then to the fact that he had a clear shot at both. It took less than a second to process the information and then to subdue the impulse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Behind Vau's head, the walls of General Zey's meeting room were a beautiful soothing shade of aquamarine, but they weren't working. Skirata wasn't <em class="calibre6">soothed.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And Captain Maze was sitting at the table beside Zey, arms folded across his chest and looking none too impressed, either. There was an ugly purple bruise at the point of his chin, more discoloration around one eye, and a cut on the bridge of his nose.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I didn't think I hit him</em> that <em class="calibre6">hard,</em> Ordo thought. <em class="calibre6">Unfortunate.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey motioned Skirata to enter just after the man strode in of his own accord, and indicated chairs at the lapiz-topped table. Bardan Jusik sat beside him, hands clasped on the tabletop in an attempt at serenity.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well,” Skirata said, and sat down. He ran his hand across the luxurious polished surface. <em class="calibre6">“This</em> is nice. I hope I never hear anyone complaining about the GAR's expenditure on armor and weapons.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal,” Vau said politely. “It's good to see you again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau was settled in one of the deeply upholstered hide chairs with the strill draped across his lap on its back, all six of its legs flopping in an undignified sprawl while he scratched its belly. Its huge fanged mouth was slack, tongue lolling, and a long skein of drool hung almost to the floor. Its body was a meter long, lengthened by a whip of a tail covered in more loose skin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill was still prettier than Vau, though. The man had a long square jawed face that was all bone and frown lines, and graying dark hair cut brutally short. Faces rarely lied about the soul within.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Walon,” Skirata said, nodding.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey gestured to Ordo to sit but he remained standing and simply removed his helmet. He transferred the bead-sized comlink connector to his ear, noting Zey's expression without looking directly at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata looked up. “Take a seat, Captain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo obeyed only one man's orders, and that man was <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey was visibly thrown—again. No doubt all other ARCs and commandos jumped when he said so, but he should have known Ordo by now. Maze certainly did. He was staring at his brother ARC as if one snap of Zey's fingers would give him permission to jump up and return that punch.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maze, perhaps you'd like to go and have a break;” Zey said. “This is just going to be a tedious administrative matter.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Maze paused for one beat, his eyes never leaving Ordo's. “Yes sir.” He grabbed his helmet from the table and left.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey waited for the doors to close behind him. “Let's hear your plan, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want to deploy Delta and Omega on Coruscant to identify and neutralize the Sep network here, because it <em class="calibre6">is</em> here,” said Skirata. “It has to be in order to strike us so easily. And CSF doesn't have the expertise or personnel to deal with this, and there might even be someone inside the CSF passing intel to the terrorists.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey's eyes were locked on him. “Commandos are a military asset. <em class="calibre6">Not</em> an intelligence one. Nor police. We have theaters of war across—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't planning to arrest anybody. This is a shoot-to kill policy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't aware we had one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You haven't, so you'd better get one <em class="calibre6">fast.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can't ask the Senate to authorize use of special forces against Coruscant residents.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't ask them.” Skirata became pure ice at times like this: Ordo watched him carefully, anxious to learn more nuances of the part of soldiering that required no weapons beyond nerve and psychology. “Is the Jedi Council squeamish about that sort of thing, too?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then don't ask them, either. In fact, we never had this conversation. All you've done is tell me you can't ask the Senate to give its blessing to a change in the GAR'S terms of reference.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But <em class="calibre6">I</em> know what you're suggesting,” Zey said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was fidgeting with his blade. Ordo could see it: it was a tiny movement, but he could detect the flex of his forearm muscles through his jacket. Skirata had the point of the blade resting on his curled middle finger and was pressing it ever so slightly up and down, a preparation for dropping and catching the grip.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The Jedi Council is pretty adept at turning blind eyes,” Skirata said. “For an organization that knew it was taking on an army with an assassination capability, you do send out conflicting signals to simple soldiers like me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau was watching the exchange like a man being mildly amused by a holovid. The strill yawned with a thin, high-pitched whine.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The difference the Senate will see,” Zey said, “is that this is <em class="calibre6">Coruscant.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“General, the days when wars were fought elsewhere while the home fires were kept burning are long gone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know. But there are armies, and there are … bounty hunters and assassins. And the Senate will be wary of crossing that line on home ground.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that's what tends to happen when you let a bunch of … <em class="calibre6">bounty hunters and assassins</em> train your army.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We didn't know we even <em class="calibre6">had</em> an army until a year ago.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe, but the fact that you're sitting here now with a general's rank means you've accepted responsibility for it. You could have objected, collectively or individually. You could have <em class="calibre6">asked questions.</em> But no. You picked up the blaster you found on the floor and you just fired it to defend yourself. Expedience ambushes you in the end.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know what the alternative was.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, General, I need to clarify a few things, being just a simple assassin and all that. Answer a few questions for me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey should have been furious that a mere sergeant was treating him as if he were an annoyingly pedantic clerk rather than a battle-hardened general. To his credit, he seemed more intent on a solution. Ordo wondered where expedience ended and pragmatism began.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very well,” said Zey.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you want to stop attacks on vulnerable targets that are starting to compromise the ability of the GAR to deploy and are destroying public confidence in the Senate's ability to defend the capital?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you think it's a good idea for some of our hard-pressed special forces lads to have an unprecedented break on Coruscant after months in the field?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey paused, just a breath. “Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you need to ask anyone else to authorize that purely administrative matter?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. General Jusik is responsible for personnel welfare.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo kept his face utterly blank. <em class="calibre6">Leave?</em> There was never any leave for the GAR, or their Jedi command in the front line. Neither would have known what to do with free time anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik looked pinned down. “I do believe some R and R would be a good idea, actually.” Skirata smiled at him with genuine warmth. Jusik was all right, one of the boys, all desperate courage and desire to belong. It was hard to tell if he was now playing the game or just being a decent officer. “I'll look into it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And sir,” Skirata said, “is it true that you knew all along that I was a complete <em class="calibre6">chakaar</em> who could never follow orders, who kept you in the dark, who treated his squads like his own private army, and was generally a <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> lowlife just like Jango and the rest of that mongrel scum?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey leaned back in his seat and pinched the end of his nose briefly, staring hard at the blue stone table.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I do believe I might realize that at some time in the future, Sergeant.” The corners of his eyes crinkled for the merest fraction of a second, but Ordo spotted it. “I have my suspicions. Proving them <em class="calibre6">is</em> hard, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey was all right, too, then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau had been watching the exchange with mild interest, and Ordo had been watching him, because he knew the man all too well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant Vau, do you have any view on this … ah … <em class="calibre6">leave</em> situation?” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh no, I'm just a civilian now,” Vau said. The strill rumbled. Vau, apparently distracted, fondled its ghastly, stinking head, his slightly narrowed eyes revealing a doting affection that he never seemed to spare for any other living creature. “I'm just hanging around. When those detainees are released, I'll offer them a room for a while, and I'll have a conversation with them. Nothing to do with the GAR or the Senate at all. Merely a private citizen doing what he can to welcome visitors to Coruscant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik was watching the exchange with an expression that suggested he was both excited and aware that the stakes had just been raised. They were subverting democracy in one sense, but they were also saving their political masters from a decision they could never be seen to take, yet had to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's the worst thing about having <em class="calibre6">chakaare</em> like us around,” Skirata said. “We just wander off, find someplace that you don't know about, and hole up in it and get into all sorts of mischief that you also know <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> about. And then we bill you for it. Dreadful.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dreadful,” Zey echoed. “Is this the kind of thing that CSF might notice?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Were we to get a little out of hand, I imagine <em class="calibre6">very</em> senior officers in CSF might need to be reassured, but not by you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dreadful,” Zey said. “Hypothetically, anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Language was a wonderful thing, Ordo thought. Skirata had just told Zey that he was about to <em class="calibre6">go bandit,</em> as he called it, running an unauthorized shoot-to-kill operation in a civilian location and simply sending Zey the bill. Vau planned to interrogate the prisoners. CSF senior command would be placated by Skirata should anything go wrong, without any need for Zey to be involved. And yet Zey had authorized it all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the subject had still <em class="calibre6">not been discussed.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wonder if anyone will notice our commandos on leave here,” Jusik said, apparently catching on.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Probably,” said Skirata. “And wouldn't it be nice if we also extended that home deployment to honest ordinary clone troopers, lots of them? That'd be good for morale.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And reassuring for the public to see soldiers in armor around the capital.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wonder how I can persuade the Senate officers that it's a good idea?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Zey cut in. “Have you met Mar Rugeyan, the Senate's head of public affairs? Just asking.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata nodded. “I do believe I've had some contact with him, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Excellent,” Zey said. “I know you two will get along very well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the conversation that had never taken place was over.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood to leave, and Vau gave the strill a gentle shove to persuade it to drop to the floor. It complained in a gravelly rumble but settled at his feet, looking up at Skirata with red-rimmed gold eyes. Skirata's hand was still cupped, arm at his side, in that way Ordo knew often preceded a fight.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, I hear Atin's returning,” Vau said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata walked out of the room, head down, Ordo right behind him. Jusik followed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You stay clear,” Skirata said quietly. “I'm meeting them all straight off <em class="calibre6">Fearless.</em> That includes Delta. And they're not yours to run anymore, remember? You just sit tight at the barracks and wait for me to give you a location.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wasn't fooled by Vau's restrained politeness. Seven years ago Vau had loomed over him as a figure of authority in his black <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> armor for the first time, the strill at his heels. Its name was Lord Mirdalan. Ordo, like all the Nulls, had perfect recall; he sometimes wished he hadn't. But at least it gave him clarity, and he knew the source of all his fears and anxieties. Lord Mirdalan—Mird—had lunged at him at Vau's command, snapping.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had drawn the little hold-out blaster that Skirata had let him keep and would have killed the animal had <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> not yelled, <em class="calibre6">“Check!”</em> and brought him to a frozen halt as his blaster aim came to rest between Mird's eyes. Vau, Ordo recalled, had laughed: he said that Ordo was <em class="calibre6">ge</em>'verd—almost a warrior. And Skirata had aimed a kick at Mird to drive it off, saying there was no “almost” about it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo watched the strill carefully. The creature trotted ahead of them, sniffing noisily in crevices and leaving behind a waft of pungent scent and a trail of drool.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If that thing's going to accompany you on jobs,” said Skirata, “you'd better keep it under control, or find a use for a strill pelt.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He drew up his arm and flicked his wrist before even Ordo could react. The three-sided blade shaved past Mird and thudded into the polished pleekwood floor a pace ahead of it. The knife vibrated to a standstill.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird squealed, leaping sideways. Ordo stepped between Vau and Skirata ready to defend <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> in yet another confrontation with the man he loathed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Skirata just turned to fix Vau with a stare that said he wasn't joking. Vau stared back, his long hard face suddenly a killer's again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not the strill's fault,” Skirata said. He walked a few paces forward and pulled the knife from the floor. The strill backed away from him, lip curled back to reveal its fangs. “But you have your warning, both of you. We need to get this job done, and that's the only reason I haven't gutted both of you already. Understood?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've moved on,” said Vau. “And it's time you did, before I end up having to kill you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo really didn't like that. He ejected the custom vibroblade in his gauntlet, a better weapon at close quarters than his blasters.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata gave him the palm-down gesture: <em class="calibre6">Leave it.</em> “Stay useful, Walon.” He beckoned Jusik and Ordo to follow him. “And I hope that Atin's moved on too, because I won't stand in his way now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How far is too far, Kal? Can you answer that? How far did <em class="calibre6">you</em> go?” Vau called after him. “I made that boy a warrior. Without me, he wouldn't be alive today.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">With</em> him, Ordo thought, Atin very nearly <em class="calibre6">wasn't.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why didn't you mention to Zey that we might also have a leak within the Grand Army?” Ordo asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because,” Skirata said, “I can't assume I know who it <em class="calibre6">isn't.</em> The leak might not even know that they're the one, either. Until then, only the strike team will know we're looking.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about Obrim? He's an ally.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hope so. But in the end, who are the only people we can really trust?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ourselves, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“So we make sure we know who's watching our back <em class="calibre6">kar'tayli ad meg hukaat'kama.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was good advice to live by. Ordo knew who always watched his.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RAS </strong><strong class="calibre11"><em class="calibre6">Fearless, </em></strong><strong class="calibre11">inbound, to Coruscant Sector Control, </strong><strong class="calibre11">369 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“I really should make a holo of this,” Commander Gett said. He reached into the assortment of pouches clipped to his belt and took out a small recorder. “It doesn't happen that often.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain and the commander of the assault ship stood on the gantry that ran around the upper hangar bulkhead and watched the extraordinary spectacle beneath them on the deck. She had heard of this thing, but never seen it. It was the <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda Verda—</em>aMandalorian ritual battle chant.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Men from the Forty-first Elite and some of the ship's company—about fifty in all, helmets off—were learning to perform it with some instruction from Fi and Scorch. Sev easy to spot by the blood-red streaks daubed on his helmet, sat on an ammunition crate nearby, cleaning his sniper attachment and looking as if he wasn't interested in joining in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was, of course. Etain could sense it, and she wasn't even properly attuned to Sev's presence in the Force.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda</em> looked fearsome. General Bardan Jusik a young man who barely came up to a clone commando's shoulder—said he loved to see it, and drew so much courage from it that he learned to perform it with his men. It was Kal Skirata's legacy; Jusik explained that the veteran sergeant wanted his men to know their heritage and taught them the rite along with Mandalorian language and culture.</div>

<blockquote class="calibre12"><em class="calibre6">Taung—sa—rang—bro—ka!</em><br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">Je—tii—se-ka—'rta!</em><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></blockquote><div class="paragraph">The commandos were layering rhythm upon rhythm, hammering first on their own armor and then turning to beat the complex tempo on the plates of the man next to them. Timed precisely, it was spectacular: timed wrong, a soldier could break the next man's jaw.</div>

<blockquote class="calibre12"><em class="calibre6">Dha—Wer-da—Ver-da—a'den—tratu!</em><br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">Cor—u—scan—to—kan—dosii—adu!</em><br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">Duum—mo—tir—ca—'tra—nau—tracinya!</em><br class="calibre1"/><em class="calibre6">Gra—'tua—cuun—hett—su—dralshy'a!</em><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></blockquote><div class="paragraph">It was irresistible, ancient, and hypnotic.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The chant rose from the hangar deck in one solid communal voice. She recognized words like <em class="calibre6">Coruscanta</em> and <em class="calibre6">jetiise: </em>Coruscant, Jedi. That <em class="calibre6">couldn't</em> have been in the original Mandalorian chant. Even their heritage had been remolded to serve a state in which they had no stake. It was, Etain recalled, something to do with being shadow warriors and forcing traitors to kneel before them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were supremely fit warriors displaying their discipline and reflexes: any flesh-and-blood enemy would have been adequately warned of the power of the forces that awaited them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But droids didn't have the sense to be scared. That was a pity, really.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain winced. The blows looked real. They were putting all their weight behind every one.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Astonishingly, none of the initiates had yet timed the movements badly enough to receive an accidental blow in the face. Fi and Scorch demonstrated another sequence. Armor clashed. Sev abandoned his feigned disinterest, took off his helmet and joined in. Then Darman appeared and they formed a line of four in the front.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was strange to watch Darman actually enjoying himself, oblivious to his surroundings: she had no idea that he had' such a powerful voice or that he could—for want of a better word—dance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Jusik always talks about this,” said Etain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've seen a few squads do it,” Gett said. “It came via Skirata, I hear.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.” Etain was wondering how she would ever measure up to that man. Halfway would have been enough. “He taught all the commandos to live up to their Mandalorian heritage. You know—customs, language, ideals.” She was mesmerized by the unconscious precision of men who were all exactly the same height. “It's very weird. It's like they have a compulsion to do it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, we do,” Gett said. “It's very stirring.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry. That was rude of me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No problem, General. It certainly wasn't part of our trooper training on Kamino. It gets passed on from man to man now.” He looked restless. She knew what he was thinking. “General—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Give me the recorder,” she said, and smiled. “Go ahead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Gett touched his glove to his brow and shot off down the ladder to the deck, sliding the last three meters on the handrails. It was delightful to see the mix of armor—yellow-striped commanders and pilots, plain white troopers, and the motley mix of commando colors—drawn together in one ancient Mandalorian ritual, every face the same.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain felt adrift, excluded.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She had never truly felt this degree of bond with her Jedi clan. The connection in the Force was there, yes, but … no, the real strength here was attachment, passion, identity, <em class="calibre6">meaning.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She thought of Master Fulier, the man who insisted she have a second chance as a Padawan and not be consigned to build refugee camps because she lacked control. The man who was also passionate and prone to taking on causes: the Jedi who lost his life because he couldn't stay out of a fight when Ghez Hokan's militia roughed up the locals on Qiilura.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain thought that wasn't such a bad sort of Jedi to be. Not textbook, but centered on fair play and justice. The clone soldiers were worth that, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was suddenly aware of Darman looking up at her, grinning, and if it hadn't been for his armor and surroundings he could have been any young man showing off his prowess to a woman. She smiled back.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She still envied him his focus and discipline, especially as he had somehow managed not to lose it after being exposed to a galaxy that didn't quite resemble the ideal he had probably been taught about on Kamino.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Kal Skirata had largely been responsible for his training. She didn't know Skirata yet, but one thing she was certain of was that he was—just like a Jedi—a pragmatic man who dealt in reality.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda</em> went on for verse after repeated verse. Then the klaxon sounded and the pipe came over the address system.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Port duties men close up. Damage and fire control parties to stations. Prepare to dock.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Commander Gett broke out of the ranks and came bounding back up the ladder, wiping sweat from his face with a neatly folded piece of cloth.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General, will you come to the bridge to see the ship alongside?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I won't be much help, but I'd like that, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was as if she were leaving a ship after a long association, a retiring captain. She was only a temporary officer, but still Gett treated her as if she actually had some importance to the crew, and she found that touching. She stood at the command console and watched as the docking grapnels and platforms slipped past the viewscreen and the crew maneuvered <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> on instruments. Gett had the con. “Stop reactor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stop reactor, Commander … reactor stopped.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fearless'</em>s secondary propulsion shivered into silence. The vessel slipped gradually into dock on the power of tugs bringing her alongside <em class="calibre6">port-side-to,</em> as Etain had now learned to call it. She walked slowly across the bridge to watch the dockside team getting a brow in place to disembark those members of the crew being transferred and to allow maintenance and replenishment teams to board.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was the slightest of jarring sensations as the ship came to rest against huge dock fenders. <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> was back safely in her home port—for the time being.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain held out her hand to Gett. “Gloves off, my friend.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He shrugged, smiling, and slipped off the entire gauntlet. They shook hands as equals. Then she pressed a key on the console, opening the public address system that reached every cabin and flat and hangar and mess deck in the huge warship.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen,” she said. “It's been an honor.”</div>

They learned to speak as many languages and absorbed weapons technology and tactics from every war: And yet, despite the overwhelming influence of alien cultures, and the absence of a true homeworld and even species, their own language not only survived but changed little, their way of life and their philosophy remained untouched, and their ideals andsense of family of identity, of nation, were only strengthened.

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The ramp went down, and for once the scene that greeted Fi wasn't hostile droid-infested territory and red blasterfire.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Coruscant—impossibly high towers and deep canyons of skylanes—was every bit as alien as Geonosis. Fi had seen it once before, all too briefly, on the way to break a siege at the spaceport. It had been an exotic, exciting lightscape at night, but in daylight it was breathtaking in a totally different way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can we have a run ashore?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner stood with his hands clasped behind him, with his Deece slung across his back. “Not my call. I'm not the sergeant now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss and the rest of Delta had formed up behind Omega in a neat line, presenting a more orderly rank. They were on the same comlink. Niner said it was ungrateful to block them out, seeing as they'd ridden to the rescue. But Omega would never hear the end of it, Fi was sure of that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Forty-first Elite were disembarked first.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch leaned a little closer to Fi. He was right behind him. The nice thing about Katarn helmet comlinks was that you could switch between circuits and have totally private exchanges without any external sign that you were talking—or even having a stand-up fight, come to that. “So you want a <em class="calibre6">run ashore</em>?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's that?” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi enjoyed Skirata's wide-ranging and often bizarre language. No other squads talked quite like Sergeant Kal's. “A night out on the town. Dinner at a fine restaurant, perhaps take in a Mon Cal ballet …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah. Right.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't, Fi,” Niner said. “You're just being cruel to the Weequay team here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, ale and warra nuts. No ballet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And maybe a little shopping with your spook squad buddy?” Scorch said. “New <em class="calibre6">kama,</em> maybe?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ah, news did travel, then. “Don't let Ordo hear you say that,” Fi said. “He'll rip your leg off and hit you with the soggy end.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah? ARCs are all mouth and <em class="calibre6">kamas.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ooh, hard man, eh?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've seen Twi'lek dancing girls tougher than you,” said Scorch. “How many times are we going to have to save your <em class="calibre6">shebs,</em> then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Probably as many times as we have to clean up your <em class="calibre6">osik,”</em> said Niner. “Can't you two talk about blowing stuff up and play nicely?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where's the general?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman interrupted. “Saying good-bye to Gett.” He seemed to be taking a keen interest in Etain's whereabouts. “Can you see Sergeant Kal yet? She said he was meeting us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So … you've been ordered around by a geriatric <em class="calibre6">and</em> a child, have you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman's voice frosted over. “Scorch, do you like medcenter food?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Touchy, touchy …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a faint click on the helmet comlink.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Delta! This is the geriatric. Get down and give me fifty, now!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Sev sighed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Omega parted ranks to give Delta the room to perform fifty press-ups in full armor, with backpacks. Fi watched appreciatively. He didn't care for Sev at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he was also scanning the landing platform for Skirata, desperate to see his <em class="calibre6">real</em> sergeant again: when Skirata was around, Niner ceased to play the senior NCO. Generals tended not to get much of a look in, either. Skirata was his own command chain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That was forty, not fifty,” Skirata said from somewhere <em class="calibre6">behind</em> them. “I hate innumeracy almost as much as I hate cracks about my personal state of disrepair.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata just had a knack for sliding around unnoticed. There had been times when Fi had wondered if he was a Force-user, because only Jedi were supposed to be able to pull those kinds of stunts. But <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> was adamant that he was simply good at his job, because he'd been doing it since he was seven years old.</div>

<div class="paragraph">That made him a late starter—by clone standards.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He appeared suddenly from between a knot of Forty-first men and ambled over to Omega, not limping quite as badly as usual and looking rather dapper in a smart leather jacket. In rough working clothes, he could disappear, but the jacket changed him utterly. Yet there was always something about the man that inspired relief and confidence. Fi felt instantly ready for anything, just as he had when Skirata had been the highest authority in his limited world on Kamino.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused for a moment in front of him. He didn't seem worried whether Delta had cranked out the extra ten press-ups or not. He just clutched Fi's arm, and hugged Darman, and slapped Niner across the shoulders, and grabbed Atin's hand. He never seemed to have the slightest trouble now in showing how much he cared about them. Over the years he'd changed from shielding his emotions behind a veneer of good-natured abuse to abandoning the pretense altogether.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Nobody had ever been fooled by it anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't scare me like that again, <em class="calibre6">ad'ike.”</em> He turned to Delta, easing themselves up from the floor. “And you bunch of <em class="calibre6">di'kute,</em> too. I'd better keep a tighter rein on you.” He watched the last of the Forty-first men disappearing into transfer vessels, presumably for return to barracks, and something appeared to amuse him. “Scorch, if you're not a good boy then I'm going to make you wear a <em class="calibre6">kama.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Sergeant. Is it true that Sergeant Vau's back?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's back, but he's not a sergeant. <em class="calibre6">I'm</em> your sergeant now, 'Scorch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And General Jusik?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's not your sergeant, either.” Skirata looked past Scorch and seemed suddenly startled. Fi turned and saw what he was staring at: Etain Tur-Mukan walked across the huge landing platform hauling the LJ-50 as if it were putting up a fight. “That has to be General Tur-Mukan, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's her,” Darman said. “She's very keen to meet you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was distracted by a blip of movement in his HUD. A scruffy civilian air taxi had risen over the parapet of the landing platform. <em class="calibre6">And it shouldn't have been able to do that.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">His unconscious brain said <em class="calibre6">danger</em> and reacted a split second before his ingrained training reminded him that <em class="calibre6">unidentified civvie vessels shouldn't penetrate the Fleet base cordon.</em> He was on one knee with his Deece charged and aimed before he even noticed from his HUD that Omega and Delta had both formed up into a single front contact formation.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The taxi stopped dead in midair.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Check!” Skirata stepped in front of them. Fi froze but Delta aimed around the sergeant. “Stand down!” One fist held up clenched to hold off the squads, Skirata signaled vigorously to the taxi with his other hand held flat, slapping down on the air. <em class="calibre6">Drop.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The taxi settled slowly on the platform.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Omega stopped dead at the check command; Delta took a second longer. Maybe it hadn't been drilled into them as it had Skirata's batch. But all of them still had their rifles trained. Fi's heart pounded. They were all wound tight and still alert to any threat, alert enough to let hard-trained reactions take over. It was what kept you alive. You could never switch it off. Your muscles learned to do things and then stopped asking your brain's permission.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry, lads.” Skirata spun around to face them. <em class="calibre6">“Udesii, udesii …</em> relax. It's ours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm glad you pointed that out, Sarge,” Niner muttered. He lowered his Deece. Fi followed his lead, and glanced behind him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain was still lying prone with her concussion rifle aimed in the right direction, no easy task with a weapon that size, but her arc of fire left something to be desired. He hoped that her Jedi sense of right place and right time would have stopped her from blowing them all to pieces if she had opened fire.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi gestured to her to stand down, and then gave up and just shook his head at her. <em class="calibre6">No.</em> She gestured back, palm up, and jumped to her feet. He wondered if anyone had thought to teach her basic hand signals.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was still apologizing. “I should have warned you I had transport coming. That was sloppy of me.” The taxi's hatch opened and a Wookiee—not a big one, just over a couple of meters tall—unfolded itself from the taxi and clambered out, throwing its head back and yawling in complaint.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, <em class="calibre6">my fault,”</em> Skirata said. He held both hands up in admission to the mountain of glossy brown fur. “They're just jumpy, that's all. We'll load now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All of us, in <em class="calibre6">that?”</em> Niner asked. It wasn't a very big taxi. “With the Wookiee, too?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, the <em class="calibre6">prisoners.</em> Just load 'em in.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where are they going?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's all you need to know right now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner paused, then shrugged and beckoned Boss, Fixer, and Atin to follow him back on board <em class="calibre6">Fearless.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had moved forward by now and walked up to Skirata, rifle slung across her back; she was so small that she looked more like a bolt-on accessory to the weapon. Darman reacted and stepped in to get Skirata's attention. It wasn't that he needed to, of course. Skirata was watching Etain, and he seemed to have one eye on <em class="calibre6">Fearless's</em> ramp, and he was placating the clearly irritated Wookiee, somehow juggling situations as skillfully as he had ever done.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General,” he said. He paused to nod formally to Etain, which—given Skirata's general contempt for anyone not in armor—seemed quite an encouraging start, Fi decided. “We've got a nice new job, and that includes you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant,” she said, and bowed her head. “You're not what I expected.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata raised an eyebrow. “Nor are you, General.” He shoved the Wookiee back a few meters, apparently untroubled by the fact that the creature could have used him for a cleaning rag. He rounded on it. <em class="calibre6">“No,</em> just put them on the back seat and <em class="calibre6">drive.</em> Let Vau do the rest.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The mention of Vau gave Fi a hint of what he couldn't grasp from the Shyriiwook words. So the Wookiee was delivering the prisoners to Walon Vau. It seemed to have volunteered to do something that Skirata preferred to leave to Old Psycho, then. The Wookiee obviously wasn't asking if they wanted to stop for lunch.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's happening here?” Etain asked. “What's happening to the prisoners?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Civilian matter, General,” Skirata said, and stood back as Niner and Boss jogged past steering a medbay repulsor with what looked like three large rolls of blanket on it. They bundled each into the back of the taxi with a little grunting and cursing, then slammed one hatch closed. “Don't you worry about it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But I <em class="calibre6">am</em> worrying about it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Wookiee barked once and folded itself back into the taxi. The vessel lifted off and swung back over the parapet, dropping below their view into one of the artificial canyons that seemed to reach down into Coruscant's core. Fi fought the urge to peer after it, then lost and walked a few paces to gaze over the edge.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a long, <em class="calibre6">long</em> way down. He was thrilled by the sheer scale and variety of it: polished stone, sparkling glass, a blur of vessels in the skylanes, hazy sunlight. Alien, utterly alien.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata blew out a breath and rocked his head slightly as if easing tense neck muscles. “General,” he said. “You and I need to talk. Omega, Delta—a transport will be taking you back to barracks.” He paused to check his chrono. “You just relax until fifteen-hundred hours and then you report to the briefing room at HQ Main Admin Building.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sarge,” said Niner and Boss, absolutely synchronized.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Etain wasn't giving up. Fi rather liked that about her, but she could be a pain in the <em class="calibre6">shebs</em> when she persisted. She stepped a little closer to Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't like being left in the dark, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then this galaxy is going to be a constant source of disappointment to you, General.” For a second Skirata had that edge in his voice that made Fi stiffen. But it softened as soon as it had hit its target. “Things change. You can say no to this, and I'm rather hoping you won't, but if you do, then Omega, Delta, and my Null boys will do it without you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain lapsed into silence. Skirata could motivate a brick if he put his mind to it. She wanted to stick with the squad and everyone <em class="calibre6">knew</em> it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She looked at him as if she was listening to other voices. “If Omega can't say no, then neither can I.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good,” said Skirata. He peeled back the collar of his jacket and muttered into a tiny comlink. It looked as if General Jusik still had a taste for supplying unusual kit. “Standing by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi peered back over the dock platform parapet, gripping the safety rail to lean out a little more and get a better look. It was the kind of view the very wealthy paid a fortune to see from their window, but you could get it for free in the Grand Army, as long as you didn't mind getting your head shot off to qualify for the privilege.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata leaned against the parapet beside him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd like to fast-rope down there,” Fi said. He'd always enjoyed that in training on Kamino. He preferred endless vistas to cramped spaces, as did many of his brothers. They said it was the legacy of being gestated in glass vats; Ordo claimed he could even remember it. “How long have we got here, Sarge? Can we see some of the city? Please?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, I promised you all a night out, didn't I? How long ago?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Eight months.” Fi remembered, all right: straight after the spaceport siege, the promise of a drink from Captain Obrim for a job well done—and then Ordo hauled them straight off for another mission. “I'd love to see it once before I—” He paused. “I'd just like to explore a bit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's brow creased briefly and he put his hand on Fi's back. “Don't talk like that, son. You'll see plenty of this, I promise.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now?” Far below, something that might have been a bird leapt suddenly into the yawning crevasse of buildings and plummeted at high speed with wings folded back until Fi lost sight of it. The platform was at least five thousand meters high. “That'd be a nice change.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you like the new battlefield, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi dragged himself away from the apparently limitless view. “So we get a spell in a stone frigate?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just something I picked up from the lads on board <em class="calibre6">Fearless.”</em> So he'd taught Sergeant Kal some new slang: <em class="calibre6">that</em> was something. “A shore-based job. Filing flimsi and answering the comlinks. Lots of caf breaks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Try threat resolution. Interdiction.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Welcome to the world of euphemism, Fi. We're going to be fighting in the hardest terrain of all. Right in the middle of billions of civvies. Slotting bad guys on Coruscant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good,” said Fi. “I hate commuting.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Arca Company Barracks, SO Brigade HQ, Coruscant</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Etain trailed Skirata down the long passage that ran from the main doors of the Arca barrack wing and felt like she was following a gdan.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Omega Squad's description had made her think of him as a kindly old uncle, a veteran soldier with a facade of tough talk who had sweated blood to give a generation of boys the benefit of his wisdom. But what she experienced in the Force was very different, just as his appearance was unlike her mental image of him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was a whirlpool of balanced conflict—truly cold black violence shot through with deep red passionate loves and hatreds. It marked him out as a complex man who had built a warrior elite. If she looked at him another way, though, he was very much the dark side—everything she had been taught to shun.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, he reminded her of a gdan, the nasty little carnivores that hunted in packs on Qiilura and would take on <em class="calibre6">any</em> prey; small by comparison with his strapping troops, but ferociously, tenaciously aggressive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he wasn't quite the elderly man the squad had first described, either. To twenty-year-old boys, he must have seemed ancient. But he was about sixty standard years—just middle-aged—and obviously fit except for his tendency to drag his left leg.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he looked <em class="calibre6">armored.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He was only wearing a civilian jacket—polished tan bantha leather with a high black collar—and plain brown pants, but he had that same presence that all the commandos had. He was <em class="calibre6">ready</em> for something. Given that he was a head shorter than his squad, had a pronounced limp, and yet <em class="calibre6">still</em> looked like trouble, Etain decided he must have once been a formidable soldier. She realized he still was.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In here, ma'am.” He could make <em class="calibre6">ma'am</em> sound like <em class="calibre6">girl</em> somehow; he could do the same with <em class="calibre6">General.</em> But as a Jedi she had no right to feel affronted by lack of deference. She realized that she simply wished he would like her. “Just a little chat and then you can find General Jusik and catch up on events.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, Skirata gave the orders.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He ushered her into a side room that turned out to be a cabin with a table, a chair, and narrow bed with a half-packed carryall sitting on it. There was a neat pile of clothing, military-grade fabric equipment cases with unidentifiable lumpy items in them, and a set of sand-gold, battle-scarred Mandalorian armor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Force told her this was a tidy room filled with the wretched chaos of broken lives, pain, and misery. She wondered if it was entirely his, but she stopped herself from probing further in case he felt it and reacted. He was a dangerously perceptive man. She had no sense at all of any animosity directed at her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's a fine helmet,” she said. It had detailed crimson and gold sigils, and the alloy section that formed the eyepiece T of the visor was jet black. There were telltale scrapes and gouges as if some huge creature had clawed at it. “Does Fi still have Hokan's armor?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata nodded. “Certainly has. Niner said he could have it, and he keeps it stashed in his locker.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain thought of Ghez Hokan, and how she had first mistaken Darman for Qiilura's brutal enforcer simply because of that sinister helmet with its T-shaped slit. Fi had the helmet now. And that was because Etain had taken Hokan's head off with her lightsaber, nearly a year and a lifetime ago when she was still not used to killing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was red armor with a distinctive gray trim. She recalled that vividly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mandalorian helmets didn't look half so fearsome now. The shape was familiar: it was even <em class="calibre6">welcome.</em> But she had somehow forgotten that Skirata, and most of the training sergeants who had been recruited to forge boys like Darman into elite commandos, had been Mandalorian mercenaries handpicked by Jango Fett.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wondered if she would have seen Skirata the same way nine months earlier, had he been her enemy on Qiilura. “Packing or unpacking?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Packing.” He lifted the fabric bags carefully and they made a metallic clunk: <em class="calibre6">weapons.</em> “We can't operate out of here. Officially we're off duty and on indefinite leave.” He laid the armor plates in the bag and layered the clothing between them, then slid in the fabric-cased weapons. It occurred to her that this was probably all he owned, the nomadic mercenary ready to move on to the next war. “Are you squeamish, General? I mean <em class="calibre6">ethically</em> squeamish.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm a Jedi, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that answers a lot of questions I didn't ask.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ask me a <em class="calibre6">specific</em> question.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you know what <em class="calibre6">black ops</em> means?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh yes …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought you might. I had no idea you would be coming back with Omega right now, but you spent four months with Zey on Qiilura turning the locals into guerrillas to fight the Seps, right? And before that you survived when Master Fulier didn't. So I reckon you're pretty handy in a scrap.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know my weaknesses.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused and looked up from his packing. “Best knowledge of all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just tell me what's at stake,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now, there's an interesting request from a Jedi.” He put his hand carefully in the side of the carryall and withdrew a small cloth-wrapped package. When he unwrapped it and held it out in his palm, she could see it held small scan bars mounted on fragments of white plastoid alloy. “For me, stopping more of these. For the Republic, stopping activity that limits the ability of the Grand Army to deploy. For the Senate, showing the Seps that they can't strike here at will. Take your pick!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She knew what the objects were now: she'd seen them on hundreds of chest plates. They were armor tallies, the identification devices all clone soldiers wore.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll take the first option.” She thought of the other Fi, the one who was no longer alive to be boyishly excited like his namesake at the prospect of seeing the Coruscant that lay beyond the barracks. “You believe I'll be of some use?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In urban operations, a woman is always useful, Jedi or not. Another aid to invisibility—old <em class="calibre6">di'kute</em> like me and females like you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata smiled and rewrapped the armor tallies. Etain reached into her bag and realized that she had even fewer possessions than this nomad. “And General Jusik is part of this operation? What about Master Zey?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General Zey is not officially aware of this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If we're not operating out of here, then where?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, somewhere interesting. Give me a couple of days and then we can relocate. Besides, the boys need some rest.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So he wasn't going to tell her. Fine. “Delta seem a little … different from Omega. I take it you have confidence in them?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, they're good lads.” He fumbled in his jacket pockets and pulled out credit chips, scraps of flimsi, and a nasty-looking metal device crested with a row of short, savage spikes and that appeared to have holes for four fingers. She stared. He placed it on the table. “The hormone that makes them hard fighters is the same one that makes them a bit of a handful, too.” The contents of Skirata's jacket continued to pile up on the table. A coil of thin wire, a fifteen-centimeter knife with a tapering three-sided blade, a stubby custom blaster, and a length of heavy, sharp-edged chain joined the cache. “Not that the poor <em class="calibre6">ad'ike</em> are <em class="calibre6">ever</em> off duty, of course. But when you say the word, they're on the case like <em class="calibre6">that.”</em> He snapped his fingers to make the point of immediacy. Yes, she'd seen that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata took off his jacket, revealing surprisingly broad shoulders and an underarm holster holding what looked like a modified Verpine shatter gun. He hung the garment over the back of a chair. Etain estimated he was still exceptionally fit in the wiry way of small men and continued to revise her view of him as a man who could only train others to fight.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And she had never seen so many instruments devoted to injury and destruction in one man's possession—not even a Republic commando. She indicated the weapons with a cocked head and waited for a hint of why he was carrying them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused, one hand raking his short gray hair.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?” he said, looking bemused.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The … kit.” He was a walking armory. “The weapons.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, don't worry.” He clearly didn't understand. “I don't carry many tools when I'm in civilian areas. Don't want to be too conspicuous. Ordo looks after the rest of it. We'll be properly cannoned up when we deploy. Guess what? Got six Verpine sniper rifles. Custom-made and EMP-hardened. <em class="calibre6">Exquisite.</em> Not really <em class="calibre6">rifles,</em> 'cos they don't have rifled barrels, but …” He grinned suddenly, apparently distracted by a thought, and she had a brief and vivid vision of another man entirely. “You haven't met Ordo yet, have you? He's a fine lad. Pride of my heart, really he is. Him and his brothers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain was totally disarmed by his candor, which seemed both incongruous and yet in keeping with a man who had gone to such extraordinary lengths to equip his young charges to survive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She knew he was a killer. She knew his people had a long history of killing Jedi, even fighting for the Sith. She knew <em class="calibre6">exactly</em> what he was, but she couldn't help liking him and knowing that he would be very, very important to her for the rest of her life.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Her certainty was in the Force. And she knew what was coming in the days and months ahead would take her beyond her limits, and would bring her no sense of peace or understanding as a Jedi. But the Force would show her what it intended her destiny to be.</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_10" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36411160" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36411162" class="calibre8"></a>7 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I think it's significant that the casualty rate among commando squads trained by Mandalorians is lower than those trained by other races. Somehow, Mandalorians imbue their charges with a sense of purpose, self-confidence, and almost obsessive sense of clan– of fancily—that gives them a genuine survival advantage. Let us be thankful they're on our side this time.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–General Master Arligan Zey, Director of Special Forces, officer commanding SO BDE, addressing the Jedi Council</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">SO Brigade HQ Coruscant, briefing room 8, 1500 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">370 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“I thought we'd have a chat,” said Skirata. He turned a chair around and swung his legs astride it, folding his arms on the chair back and resting his chin on them. “Just us <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> boys. No <em class="calibre6">aruetiise</em> present.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta Squad had settled in seats on one side of the briefing room and Omega on the other, with the table between them. Skirata could have sliced through the atmosphere between Atin and Sev with a vibroblade: how could they think he hadn't noticed? He knew how to read every nuance of cloned men like a book, even if they weren't the ones he knew intimately. In fact, he could read most species now. So they either thought he was stupid, or they were so at ease in his company that they felt no need to disguise their feelings.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the Delta boys—like Omega—were painfully loyal to their sergeants. They sat around in dark red fatigues, looking disturbingly young without their armor and weapons.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't see Tur-Mukan or Jusik as traitors; do you?” Darman said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was using <em class="calibre6">aruetiise</em> in the general sense of non Mandalorian.” Oh, Darman <em class="calibre6">was</em> fond of Etain, wasn't he? He'd have to keep an eye on that. “What I've got to say is just squad business, not the officers'.” Skirata dropped his knife from his sleeve and fidgeted with the blade, running his fingertip carefully along the honed edge. “I hope you're listening to this, Delta.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sarge.” Boss was watching him intently.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you, Sev.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev glanced at Atin for the merest fraction of a second, but enough to confirm Skirata's hunch. “Yes, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, number one—any bad blood between me and Vau is <em class="calibre6">our</em> business, not yours. If any of you want to fight about it, I'll personally make you regret it. Save it for the bad guys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The silence was almost solid. Atin stared ahead of him, unblinking; Sev compressed his lips as if choking back protest and flicked a glance at Niner. Darman and Fi simply looked baffled.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, Sev,” Skirata said. “Niner didn't say a word to me, but I've got eyes in my backside and a <em class="calibre6">very</em> good memory. You do <em class="calibre6">not</em> have a grudge against Atin, do you understand me? If you want to argue the toss about my little altercation with Vau, then you have it out with <em class="calibre6">me.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Understood, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good. Prove it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You two.” Skirata motioned to Atin and Sev with the point of his blade. “Get up and shake hands.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Neither Atin nor Sev moved for a moment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I said get up and shake hands. <em class="calibre6">Now.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata wondered if he'd lost them, but then Atin stood just a heartbeat before Sev did. They leaned across the table that separated them and shook hands as ordered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now do it again and <em class="calibre6">mean it,”</em> Skirata said quietly. “You <em class="calibre6">have</em> to be one team now, one big squad, and when I tell you what we're up against you'll understand why. Boss, I expect you to keep your boys in line.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss leaned forward and shoved Sev in the back. “You heard the sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin held his hand out again. Sev took it and shrugged.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good,” Skirata said. “Because we're off the charts now. What we're about to do has no official authorization from the Senate or the generals, so if we screw up, we're on our own.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah,” said Scorch. “So Jusik and Tur-Mukan don't know about this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh yes, they do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then who's <em class="calibre6">we?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You, our young generals, Ordo, Vau, and me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch raised his eyebrows. “You're <em class="calibre6">operational</em> again?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was time for a little theater. “Yes.” Skirata hurled his knife with the exquisite accuracy born of decades of surviving by it. It embedded itself in the wooden paneling behind Sev, half a meter to his right. “Bet you can't do <em class="calibre6">that</em> with a vibroblade, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He can if I pick him up and throw him,” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They all laughed. Skirata wondered if they'd still be laughing in a few minutes. Ordo was due back soon. With any luck, he and Vau would have beaten some information out of Orjul; the Nikto were probably too tough even for Vau to crack in that time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">In the end it might not matter. He had his team ready to deploy on Coruscant <em class="calibre6">now—his</em> team, not the Republic's—and they could do things that CSF either wouldn't or couldn't. Obrim had his hands tied by laws and procedures, and maybe he even had a mole among his own comrades.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But this strike team had no laws at all: it didn't even exist. On Triple Zero, it was … <em class="calibre6">zero.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata hadn't asked Zey what would happen to them if they got it wrong. They could end up dead, all of them. It was an academic detail.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch got up, pulled the knife from the wall, and handed it back to Skirata with a grin. Fixer applauded.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remember all that dirty black ops stuff that me and Vau taught you way back?” Skirata slid the blade back up his sleeve again. <em class="calibre6">My dad's knife. All I have of him. I took it off his body.</em> “Or did you file it with the boring stuff on contingency orders and emergency procedures?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think we <em class="calibre6">recall</em> it, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata remembered it, and didn't want to. It was training that had to be done. It broke his heart, but it was going to be all that stood between those boys and death sooner or later. They had to be able to face the unimaginable, and—yes, there were even worse things than charging a line of droids with your comrades.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There were the things you might have to face alone, in a locked room, with no hope of rescue.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Maybe Vau was right. Perhaps trainees needed to be brutalized beyond the point where they were just brave, pushed into a state of existence where they became animals intent only on survival. That was how Vau had nearly killed Atin. It was why Skirata had then gone after Vau and nearly killed <em class="calibre6">him.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not proud of what I did to you,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You crawled through the nerf guts first, Sarge. It looked like so much fun that we followed you in.” Fi roared with laughter and leaned back in his seat. “And then you threw up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Sickener, they called it. One more endurance test to make sure they could face conditions that would break and kill lesser men, crawling through a ditch filled with rotting nerf guts.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But there were more tests to come. A night out in Fest-like temperatures; no sleep for three days, maybe more; scant water, a full sixty-kilo pack, and blistering heat; and a lot of pain. Pain, pitiless verbal abuse, and humiliation. A captured commando could expect brutal interrogation. They had to be able to cope without breaking, and it took some imagination to test that to the limit.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">How far is too far, Kal?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau was much more detached about handing out all that punishment than Skirata could ever be. It was very hard to hurt your sons, even if it helped them survive the unsurvivable.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well,” Skirata said, mortified that Fi could take it in such good spirits. “The nerf guts were the <em class="calibre6">fun</em> part. It all goes downhill alter that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev seemed quite animated. “Do we get to do assassinations?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If we do, they never happened. You imagined them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoops. My trigger finger just <em class="calibre6">slipped,</em> Sarge. Honest.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You catch on fast about the fascinating world of politics in which we now find ourselves, young man.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is it okay if I say politicians are gutless <em class="calibre6">chakaare?”</em> Scorch asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Call 'em what you like, son. You still haven't got a vote.” Skirata felt the thud of boots striding down the passage outside. The vibration carried; their voices didn't. “Wars are <em class="calibre6">legal</em> violence. Everything else is just crime. Fortunately we're Mandalorian, so we're a lot less prissy about that fine distinction.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just point us at the bad guys and say go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's the awkward bit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What is?” Scorch asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've got to find them first.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, we found quite a few so far …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta laughed like one man, even Sev, and Omega joined in. The coded entry system blipped and the doors slid open. Ordo strode through them, probably aware of the kind of entrance he could make.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta had never worked with a Null ARC before. Maybe they thought it would be no different from working with Alpha or any of the other Jango-trained ARC troopers. Skirata watched with interest. Ordo would certainly break some more ice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sir!” Delta said sharply, all at once. Niner and the rest of Omega just touched their brows casually.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry I'm late, Sergeant.” Ordo took off his helmet, tucked it under one arm, and handed Skirata a datapad and a rather heavy flimsi-wrapped package about the size of a small blaster case. “Not much information, but Vau is still working on the problem. And General Jusik sends his compliments.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, Captain.” Skirata glanced at it and then unwrapped the parcel. But it wasn't a weapon; it was a box of candied vweliu nuts. Jusik was a very thoughtful officer indeed. Skirata broke the seal and got up to place it on the table within the reach of both squads. “Fill yer boots, lads.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had his usual silly grin on his face, the faintest hint that he might be planning to do something at Ordo's expense.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ooh, nice new skirt!” said Fi. “You went to all that trouble just for us? What happened to the old <em class="calibre6">kama?</em> Did it shrink in the wash?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He got up and stood a pace or two in front of Ordo, still grinning and clearly expecting some backslapping or some other show of delight at reunion after several months.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“ 'Scuse me, Sergeant,” Ordo said calmly, and smacked Fi down on the floor with a none-too-playful body press. Fi yelped. Being hit by someone in armor when you weren't wearing your own <em class="calibre6">hurt.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss's expression was a study in shock. The Delta boys jerked upright in their seats and stared as if they were debating whether to step in and break it up. Ordo looked like cold death; even Skirata had times when he wasn't quite sure which way Ordo would jump.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your big mouth is going to get you into a lot of trouble one day,” the ARC hissed. Fi, eyes locked on Ordo's, neck tensed, looked ready to fight back. “So you better hope <em class="calibre6">I'm</em> there when that happens.” Then Ordo burst out laughing and got to his feet in one move. He hauled Fi upright by his arm, slapping his back enthusiastically. “The old firm back together again, eh? Good stuff!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss glanced at Skirata, who smiled enigmatically, or so he hoped. Nulls were either your best friend or your worst imaginable enemy. Fi, luckily, had a devoted friend. He still looked shaken by the nature of the reunion, though.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you can thin out now and we'll resume tomorrow morning with our little generals for a full intel briefing at oh eight-hundred,” Skirata said. “Now that we all understand each other.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took a handful of candied nuts and stepped outside with Skirata. The two men stood in the corridor, giving the squads a chance to chat now that Delta had been suitably unnerved. And maybe they thought he couldn't hear them, but Skirata wasn't as hard of hearing as they imagined, years of exposure to deafening fire or not.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it wasn't what he expected to hear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek, I remember thinking he was just bent over breathless, but he was actually crying and <em class="calibre6">throwing up.</em> And it wasn't the nerf guts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He never liked knocking us around.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And he <em class="calibre6">always</em> apologized and made sure we were okay afterward.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Top man.” That was Niner talking. <em class="calibre6">“Jatne'buir.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">The best father.</em> Well, that was a joke. His own kids had formally disowned him and declared him <em class="calibre6">dar'buir</em> instead—no longer a father. It was a very rare and shameful thing for a Mando father to be formally shunned by his sons.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he couldn't have left Kamino, or even told them where he was and that he hadn't completely abandoned them. Not even Ordo knew about the declaration of <em class="calibre6">dar'buir.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You put your clones first, before your own flesh and blood, didn't you?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you all right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And I don't regret doing that, not a second of it.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm fine, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.</em> Vau must be losing his touch, then. Nothing useful from our friends?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There might be nothing to get out of them, of course. But it's not a quick process, interrogating experienced suspects without killing them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about getting one of our jetiise to help out? They're good at persuasion.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Possibly too squeamish. Jusik is always anxious to please, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's much more use in the field. Brave lad, handy with tech, and a good pilot. But the girl's got an edge to her. Let's see if she'll put pragmatism above principle.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you dislike them, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not a matter of liking them or not. It's whether they're reliable. Look, Zey will waste you and every last clone—and me—if he thinks it'll win the war and save civilians. But Jusik hero-worships you. And I don't know which of those two extremes is the more dangerous.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is your opportunity to help them become the soldiers you made of us, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Ouch.</em> “Why do I always get the feeling that you were more of a man at four years old than I would ever be?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo gave him a playful shove. He was clearly in a good mood today. “Let me ask General Tur-Mukan to interrogate the prisoners. If she finds that morally unacceptable, then her view of you won't be tainted by it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had to bite his lip. Ordo often shamed him with unexpected compassion and diplomacy. “Yeah, I reckon she'll find it easier to do the heroic infantry stuff than get dirty along with us. But leave her to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very well,” Ordo said. “Have you decided where we need to base the operation?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've got a few people who owe me favors. Where would you hide soldiers?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Hide</em> hide or conceal hide?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not-taking-much-notice-of-activity hide.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Somewhere with a bar. Somewhere you'd get a lot of off-duty traffic.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't drink. Never seen a clone drink much at all.” Skirata was suddenly ambushed again by Ordo's agile brain. For a man who knew little of life beyond warfare, his ability to learn and extrapolate from the smallest scrap of information was breathtaking. “And you never get off duty.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You said, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir,</em> that you might disguise the presence of some <em class="calibre6">hulking big boys in armor</em> by having a lot more of them around. You were going to see Mar Rugeyan about a <em class="calibre6">smokescreen.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remember Mar Rugeyan? The man who can talk out of all three corners of his mouth at the same time? The man you grabbed by the—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Kal remembered, all right. “Yeah, if I'd known then that I'd need him I'd have been a little more careful.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think I can propose an idea he might find attractive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Would that involve leaving bruises?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't planning to injure him. Just point out that if troopers were actually allowed leave in considerable numbers, it would reassure the public, too. Eventually we become invisible.” Ordo pondered, that tell tale little frown creasing his brow. Sometimes his staggering intellect and perfect recall didn't help him process the real world one bit, at least not where Skirata was concerned. “Let me try, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> I promise I'll be more diplomatic.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It was a joke, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.</em> I think you'd probably stand as much chance of charming him as I would right now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Have I ever let you down?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wasn't a rhetorical question. Skirata was mortified. It was all too easy to swagger out of the meeting full of aggressive confidence and forget that Ordo—muscular, lethal, the ultimate soldier—was vulnerable to the approval of one person alone: <em class="calibre6">him.</em> It was as if Ordo became that literal, trusting child again, the one who had decided that the only person in the galaxy who would ever look out for him and his brothers was a down-on-his-luck mercenary who didn't much like Kaminoans.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I didn't mean it literally.” Skirata reached up and ruffled his hair just like he'd done when Ordo was a scared little kid, terrified by the lightning on Kamino, except he hadn't had to reach quite so far in those days. “You're my pride and joy. You couldn't be smarter or better or braver, any of you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo looked blank for a moment and then managed a smile, but it was the placatory gesture of a child under threat. “I know I have gaps in my knowledge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, son … I'm going to change that. For all of you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir”</em> His trust was transparent and absolute. “You're our protector and we'll always serve you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata winced. Faith was devastating if you weren't up to being a god.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">But I don't regret it. No, not a second of it.</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Logistics center, Grand Army of the Republic, Coruscant </strong><strong class="calibre11">Command HQ, 370 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“You're not on the authorized personnel list for this center,” said the security droid at the doors.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo reached past it and tapped a memorized code into the door panel. The sentry was a solid block with four arms, a head shorter than he was. “Well done. You're right to challenge me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sir—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo reached into his belt and took out a stylus probe. The droid was fast, but not fast enough to avoid the probe Ordo slipped silently into the command port in its chest. There was a chack-chack-chack of memory drives and motors stalling for a moment, and then the droid seemed placated.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You appear to be on the authorized personnel list,” it said. “You have access to all areas including those restricted to staff officers, without on-site security tracking.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Excellent,” Ordo said, walking through the doors into the polished white marble lobby. “I'm a very private person.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it was easy to be private when you were in armor. Nobody took much notice of a clone inside the GAR complex, not even one wearing an ARC trooper captain's livery.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was simply a matter of looking as if you had every right to be going about your business. And the Null squad's proper business was anything Kal Skirata deemed it to be. Right now that meant identifying a method of inserting covert surveillance into Logistics, the most likely place for a mole who could relay very precise information on transport and contractor movements to the Separatists.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took out his datapad and consulted it frequently as if he were here for a routine visit. Without the possibility of eye contact, none of the civilian staff seemed even to register his presence. The white armor here was usually clone troopers who were physically unfit for front-line service, Engineer Corps, or ARC troopers carrying out occasional inspections for their generals.</div>

<div class="paragraph">After striding into a few offices, startling the droids and getting an occasional glance from civilian technicians, Ordo walked into the operations room at the heart of the logistics wing, and struck gold.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a large circular room with walls that were covered in live holocharts of troop and materiel movements. It danced with brilliant light and color, a HUD on a grand scale. At the room's heart was a large multistation desk staffed by two droids, four humans, six Sullustans, three Nimbanese, and …</div>

<div class="paragraph">… one clone trooper, minus his helmet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Excellent,” Ordo said aloud.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The clone trooper jumped to his feet and saluted, even though it was technically a poor example of protocol to do so without his helmet in place. Ordo returned the salute anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Problem with your helmet, trooper?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The man lowered his voice. “It makes the civilians edgy, sir. They prefer to see my eyes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo bristled. He would never defer to civilians' whims. “I'm carrying out a routine survey for General Camas.” He didn't give the man his designation. Alpha ARCs rarely bothered to identify themselves to the lower ranks. He glanced at the civilians: one of the Nimbanese and a human female looked up at him. The pale reptilian Nimbanel was interesting as a detail, but the human female was enough to make him stop, stare, and note her as suspicious. She <em class="calibre6">smiled at</em> him. He still had his helmet on, but she <em class="calibre6">smiled</em> at him, and she was shockingly beautiful; both those facts were, worrying in an administrative department. She looked down at her data console, lost in her work again, and flicked long pale blond hair over one shoulder.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Trooper,” Ordo said. He beckoned the man to him. “I'd like you to brief me on the operation of this unit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They walked outside the main doors, and Ordo removed his helmet to look a brother in the eye and give him due respect. His glove's tally scanner told him the man was CT-5108/8843, an EOD operative: a bomb disposal expert, the kind of man who disarmed booby traps and UXBs so that other troopers could advance, the kind of man who could do work that even droids could not.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The explosives connection wasn't lost on Ordo for one moment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's your name?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The trooper hesitated. “Corr, sir,” he said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And what brings you here?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr paused and then pulled off his gauntlets.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had no hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had been replaced by two simple prosthetics, so basic that they didn't have a synthflesh coating, just the bare durasteel mechanism. Ordo didn't even have to ask how he had acquired them. Somehow losing <em class="calibre6">both</em> hands was shocking in a way that losing one was not. Hands defined humanity.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's a parts shortage, sir, what with there being so many men injured and needing prosthetics,” Corr said apologetically. “And these aren't good enough for me to do my job in the front line. As soon as the parts come through, I'll be back, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo knew what <em class="calibre6">Kaibuir</em> would have said then, and he was moved to do the same, but this wasn't the time or the place. He held back. “Do they treat you properly here?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr shrugged. “Fine. Actually, sir, the civilians tend not to speak to me that much, except for Supervisor Wennen. She's very kind to me indeed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo could see it coming. “Wennen would be the blond woman, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr nodded, his expression noticeably softened. “Besany Wennen. She doesn't approve of the fighting, sir, but she doesn't let it affect her work and she's looking after me very well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Poor naïve trooper. “How</em> well?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We have lunch together and she's taken me to visit the Galactic Museum.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fascinating.</em> Ordo had learned the wisdom of mistrust at a very early age. Glamorous woman, EOD expert, logistics hub: he could work it out. <em class="calibre6">Not</em> starting his observation here would have been stupid, but there was little to be gained from crashing in yet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How many shifts?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Three per daily roster, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I might need to ask you to do something for me, Corr.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Certainly, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But when I do, it will be classified and you're to discuss it with nobody, not even your supervisor. It will be part of a routine fraud audit, that's all, and that's why I need your silence.” Did it matter if he told him his name? Only the special forces inner circle knew who he was anyway. “My name is … Ordo. Mention <em class="calibre6">that</em> to nobody.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes sir. Understood.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wanted to tell him that he understood his loneliness among strangers and his need to be back with his brothers at the front, doing <em class="calibre6">real</em> work. But he could tell him nothing. He ushered him back into the operations room, noted the lovely and apparently genuine smile that Supervisor Wennen gave him, and paused on his way out to break into the automated comlink relay and place a monitoring device.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Poor Corr.</em> Ordo patted the sentry droid on the head and strode to his parked speeder.</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_11" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36412253" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36412254" class="calibre8"></a>8 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Yes, I know how the Kaminoans did it. They used our genes against us, the ones that make us bond with our brothers, make us loyal, make us respect and obey our fathers—that's what they manipulated to make us more likely to obey orders. They had to remove what made Jango a selfish loner, because that makes a bad infantry soldier, and you can tell from the Alpha ARCS that the Kaminoans weren't wrong. But there's one thing I don't know yet—and that's how they controlled the aging process. That's the key. They robbed us of a full life span. But we will</em> not <em class="calibre6">be defeated by time,</em> ner vod.</div>

<div class="paragraph">–ARC Trooper Lieutenant N-7—Mereel—in an encrypted transmission to N-11, Ordo</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Republic Administration, Senate Head of Public Affairs Office, </strong><strong class="calibre11">floor 391, Support Services Center, 370 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Mar Rugeyan's office was very near the top floor of the administration building and had a view that some Senators would have killed for. Ordo wondered how Rugeyan did his killing—metaphorically, anyway—because he had the air of a man who would terminate anyone in his way without a second thought.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a long way down. Ordo tucked his helmet under his arm and admired the steady stream of speeders in the sky-lanes below.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's been a while,” Rugeyan said, perfectly pleasant. “I never imagined I might be in a position to be any help to <em class="calibre6">you.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The subtle threat wasn't lost on Skirata, at least if his blink rate was anything to go by. “I appreciated your assistance during the siege. You remember my captain, don't you? Captain Ordo? Sir, can Mr. Rugeyan offer you anything to drink?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A glass of juice would be very welcome, thank you.” Skirata was indeed inferior in rank, but it always made Ordo uncomfortable to hear <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> call him <em class="calibre6">sir.</em> “We were wondering if you might be able to advise us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Rugeyan betrayed no discomfort whatsoever at talking to a clone. “Happy to help, Captain.” He tapped something on his desk. “Refreshments, please, Jayl. Juice and some cakes.” He smiled. “But what could I advise you upon? You seem to have your public image pretty well honed. Smart, efficient, and noble. You can't buy an image like that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We feel that our troops should have a little more comfort in life and we're aware how much weight your advice carries with key members of the Defense Department,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah.” Rugeyan's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. “Quite right, too. What do you want out of this, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Leave.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“More of it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Any</em> of it. They don't get leave. Any downtime is spent in barracks or in training.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You didn't know that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, frankly, I didn't. I never asked.” Rugeyan actually seemed surprised, or at least he was feigning it very well. “But that's a command decision. They won't bend easily to public servants like me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took a glass of brilliant emerald juice handed to him by Rugeyan's young female assistant, who simply stared, eyes scanning him. <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> was right: Civilians never saw clone soldiers face-to-face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It almost threw him off track. “In strategic terms, the temporary withdrawal of a few thousand troops from the front line makes very little difference,” he said. “But I'm sure you know that warfare isn't all about big bangs. There's another front, and that's here.” Ordo tapped his temple. “Visible troops around Coruscant. Good for public confidence right now, with the constant threat of terror attacks. And good for our men.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Rugeyan toyed with a cake studded with chunks of glistening red and purple fruit. “I admit that the Senate would like some positive results on the terror attacks. It's making the administration look helpless. Much as I respect our colleagues in the CSF, they're not making much progress, are they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata cut in. “But if they did, it would be very timely, wouldn't it? And I'm sure that you'd be told about it right away.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">This was the interesting thing about Skirata. He could speak around corners. He was an articulate self-educated man, and that always came as a surprise to outsiders. Jusik fell for the rough-diamond act all too often, but Vau wasn't the only <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> with a razor-sharp mind and a fine line in rhetoric. Skirata could switch from <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> hard man to politician without a visible change of gear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo found every conversation an education.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I always appreciate information,” Rugeyan said. “Especially when I know it'll serve some real purpose.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So,” Ordo said, and drained his glass. The assistant popped in again as if she'd been staking out the office and refilled it. “We have two battalions of the Forty-first Elite back in barracks and an assault ship's crew waiting on a refit. If someone could come up with the idea of an extended leave with the men allowed and encouraged to go off base, I think everyone would benefit. And maybe some credits to spend, because they don't get paid. A nice feel good story for the media.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Rugeyan's expression flickered briefly from professional neutrality to surprise and then back again. “Never even thought of that, you know. So is this going to involve <em class="calibre6">your</em> men? The RCs?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Rugeyan pronounced it <em class="calibre6">Arr-Sees,</em> like a soldier would. It was internal jargon and not for outsiders. Skirata blinked for a second, and then shifted down a gear into <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> mercenary again, albeit it one in a better mood than usual.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're not <em class="calibre6">RCs.</em> Arr-See sounds like a droid to the public. My boys are <em class="calibre6">men.</em> So please refer to them as Republic Commandos, not just commandos, and the other forces as troopers, or by their rank.” He slurped his caf enthusiastically. “Words like RCs, cannon fodder, grunts, gropos, squad-dies, pongoes, meat cans, white jobs, or even shiny boys create the wrong impression. Terminology is everything, I find.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Rugeyan was actually making notes on a sheet of flimsi. He took no offense at all, not visibly anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very useful,” he said. “Leave this to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And I'm sure Captain Obrim has your comlink code at the very top of his list, should there be any good news for you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata smiled and looked as if he meant it. Ordo nursed his glass, leaving a little juice at the bottom to fend off more instant attention from Rugeyan's assistant.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“An inevitable fact of life is that some of us are doomed to do the dirty thankless work in the shadows while someone else gets the headlines,” Rugeyan said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Headlines can be overrated,” said Skirata. “The captain has another meeting to attend, but thank you for your time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was all <em class="calibre6">very</em> civilized: another coded conversation where the unspeakable had somehow been spoken.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it was all a far cry from the sweaty, anxious hours at the Galactic City spaceport a few months before, when Rugeyan had been no more than a severe irritant and Skirata had taken a rather physical dislike to him. Now the man seemed to have a clear and almost uncanny grasp of exactly what he was being asked to do, and although he must have had questions, he never asked them. It almost made him a soldier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The descent in the turbolift felt like a rapid insert via gunship as they plunged down a hundred levels.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata began laughing quietly and pinched the bridge of his nose, eyes shut. “I wish I'd realized that Rugeyan would respond to a simple request. Then I'd never have—well, you know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you hadn't captured his attention in such an assertive way at the siege, perhaps he wouldn't have been so accommodating today. That man might even make a useful member of an intelligence bureau one day.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He just needed me to show some understanding of his own position. Sometimes I think people want more from me than they actually do. So where does this leave us, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo counted off on the fingers of his glove. “Smokescreen in progress. Team on standby, split into watches. Observation points and potential operational houses collated and identified. Armory and logistics in place. Confirmed link between devices and prisoners.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All dressed up and nowhere to go. Still a large gap in the intel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What did the droid crack out of the download from Atin?” Skirata asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A lot of data that needs combing by hand when we have other intel to put alongside it. It's just lists of businesses like any transport company would keep. Nothing leaps out. Sometimes I wish we had to deal with Weequays. They'd label things TOP SECRET and give us a clue.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why is this proving so hard? Fierfek, son, Kom'rk and Jaing can track a flitnat across the galaxy and we can't find a gang in our own backyard.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.” I should be able to crack this. I'm letting him down.</em> “This is a double line of surveillance, I'm afraid—the terror network itself and whoever is providing their recce intelligence—and that could be inside our own organization, or in the CSF, and the latter is going to be harder to identify.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not blaming you. It's just an expression.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And my brothers do know the identities of the flitnats they're looking for, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only one option left, then. Explore every line and dot, and hope for a lucky break while we're doing it to speed things up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Unless Vau gets lucky.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Time to break out the emergency Jedi, I think, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh-eight-hundred tomorrow,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Still got time to do some more preparation, then. Let's go and see a Hutt who owes me one. Well, a lot more than one, actually. And let's pick up Sev and Scorch so they can see how it's done.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There were things Skirata could do that not even a commando or an ARC could, and one of those was to work his contacts.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo committed it all to memory. Tonight would be highly educational.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Qibbu's Hut, entertainment district, Coruscant; Delta recce troop in attendance</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Garish green light framed the pulsing orange sign above the entrance. Qibbu opened late: it was already dark, and Skirata thought it was high time the bar welcomed new customers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm only a simple trained killer,” Sev said, “but something tells me never to eat in a restaurant with a bad pun over the door.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You haven't tried the food yet,” Skirata said. “That'll leave no room for doubt.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Or dessert,” Scorch said. “And did I mention I feel naked?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“About a dozen times since we left HQ. Get used to it. You can't wear armor all the time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo drew one blaster. Scorch raised his eyebrows.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm being low-key,” Ordo said. “Or I'd draw both.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I really didn't notice you in that shiny white rig at all, sir …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Listen up, lads.” Skirata slid one hand into his pocket to feel for a reassuring meter of durasteel chain and held his right arm straight at his side. He hadn't seen the Hutt in a long time, years before Kamino, and it was bound to be a nasty shock for the old slug.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Qibbu might be surprised to see me, especially as he still owes me a fee. So no heroics. I can handle him.” Skirata gestured for the two commandos to stand back in the open lobby. “Look casual and read the menu. And don't throw up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The sprawling maze of rooms passed for a restaurant, bar, and hotel, but only if the Coruscant food hygiene inspectors were looking the other way. It was perfect in every way if you wanted <em class="calibre6">not</em> to be bothered. There was a certain anonymity in the rough end of the entertainment district.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was just the kind of place where an awful lot of clone soldiers could pass in and out without drawing comment, at least after the novelty wore off. Skirata leaned on the intercom.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu the Hutt <em class="calibre6">was</em> at home. He just knew it. It was the skinny Duros suddenly standing in the doorway with a blaster that gave the game away.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're closed,” the Duros said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And I'm Kal Skirata.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Duros' gray fist closed on the blaster. “And I said we're <em class="calibre6">closed.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo swung around the door and leveled his blaster in the Duros' flat face. “No, I do believe you're <em class="calibre6">open,</em> and we'd like to see tonight's special, please.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Duros paused long enough to gape, which was probably what saved his life. If he'd lifted the blaster, Ordo would have killed him. Ordo grabbed his wrist anyway and twisted it almost as a side effect of wresting the blaster from his grip, and there was the unmistakable <em class="calibre6">snick</em> of cracking bone. The Duros squealed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think that means come right in,” Skirata said, and made sure he had his blaster in his waistband. Qibbu might have shelled out some credits for competent help after all. He wandered into the deserted restaurant and noted that the carpet didn't quite stick to his boots as much as it used to. He wandered behind the bar, as much to check that nobody was lurking there to give him a Very Unhappy Hour as to see if the glasses were clean.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo's blaster whirred faintly as he raised it. When Skirata looked up, Sev and Scorch were covering one door each. <em class="calibre6">Good lads.</em> They'd all do fine out in the big bad world.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ka-a-al …” Qibbu inched out of the kitchens, a waft of exotic spice and burned fat escaping as the Hutt eased himself into the bar area. “So you come for your bounty at last. I thought you would never come. And you have staff and a <em class="calibre6">nice</em> jacket now … must be doing better business, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Colleagues,”</em> Skirata said. “I'll take hard currency, but if you haven't got that, we can negotiate.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu was unattractive even by Hutt standards. His tongue flicked across his slit of a mouth, and he edged to the bar to slither onto his dais and pour a couple of drinks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your boys want ale?” Qibbu indicated a jar of pickled gorg on the bar. “Snacks?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No thanks.” Sev and Scorch were a chorus, eyes fixed on the jar of very dead amphibians. “Couldn't manage another thing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you and I talk, then, Ka-a-al.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I take it you haven't got ready currency?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not that much. Give me time, and—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let me make it easy for both of us.” Skirata pulled up a stool and sat down to bring himself level with the Hutt's eyes. “I'm a tourist. Can my boys take a look at your rooms? If we like what we see, we'll stay for a while.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata indicated the turbolift. Sev and Scorch drew their blasters and disappeared for a recce. Ordo locked the main doors again and paced slowly around the bar, probably committing the layout and every detail to memory. A right little holorecorder, Ordo: another superb advantage of perfect recall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So … you have a project in hand, Ka-a-al?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I might have.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does it involve … dead people?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not this time. I just need a place where my colleagues and I can relax and not be bothered for a while.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu's yellow slit-pupiled eyes followed Ordo around the bar. Skirata could never see yellow eyes now without thinking of Kaminoans.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your colleagues are soldiers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. They like to make the most of their leave. They don't get much.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So they do little … <em class="calibre6">jobs</em> for you,” Qibbu said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, and none of those jobs need inconvenience you. You won't' get any visits from CSF, because my boys behave themselves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You just want … <em class="calibre6">peace and quiet</em> for them to do those little jobs for you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You have no idea how much, Slug-Breath.</em> “Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In exchange, you write off that small sum I owe you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I might.” It was five hundred thousand credits plus interest. He didn't need it now. There was a time when he would have risked his life and that of anyone who got in the way to pick up a fee like that. He'd been a successful debt enforcer for a brief time, but it wasn't proper soldiering. “I might also bring some trade your way, because there could be a lot of troopers in town who want to visit somewhere relaxing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You offer me more than I owe you. There is a <em class="calibre6">catch.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“The catch,” Skirata said, feeling the negotiation slipping away from him, “is that you'll guarantee no trouble here. And my definition of trouble is quite exacting.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No unwanted attention.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And no nonsense from your usual low-life clientele. No taking advantage of my soldier boys. As much food as they want—fresh and properly cooked, please—and clean rooms. They don't drink much but they do tend to like a lot of caf and sweet beverages.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu blinked slowly, still apparently distracted by Ordo, who was taking an interest in the kitchen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mind if I do a food hygiene inspection?” Ordo said, and disappeared into the kitchens without waiting for a reply.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu's gaze slid toward the kitchen and then back to Skirata. “You ask for a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> for your shiny boys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata closed his hand around the end of the chain in his pocket. The slug needed to learn who had the upper hand in this negotiation. “That's because they <em class="calibre6">deserve</em> a lot, you <em class="calibre6">owe</em> me a lot, and if you mess me about you'll have a lot more <em class="calibre6">trouble</em> than you could possibly imagine—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's buildup to giving Qibbu a serious smacking was suddenly interrupted by a stifled shriek from the kitchens. A young Twi'lek female came rushing out the doors. He realized Ordo must have startled her. It might have been the twin blasters.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And only <em class="calibre6">respectable</em> females allowed in the bar,” Skirata added. But the Twi'lek looked terrified in a way that said she was used to being that way, and he didn't like that at all. He knew Qibbu only too well. “She doesn't look like your usual … kitchen staff.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The girl huddled against the far wall, staring at Ordo, who merely walked out and holstered his blaster with an exaggerated gesture. He didn't do <em class="calibre6">reassuring</em> very well at the best of times, let alone with women. It was time to teach him more social graces when carrying firearms.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Hutt gurgled a laugh. “Females … you know how they are—”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Enough.</em> Skirata pulled his durasteel chain out in one movement and whipped it around Qibbu's neck, twisting it in his fist as he wrenched the quivering bulk toward him. The metal cut into the creature's soft fat, leaving a white margin where the blood could no longer circulate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Listen, <em class="calibre6">shag,”</em> Skirata said, feeling his anger tightening his throat muscles. There was no worse insult for a Hutt than <em class="calibre6">slave.</em> “I <em class="calibre6">like</em> Twi'lek females. Honest ones, the sort that don't thieve, or worse. So no mistreating the staff or I might discover what a trade union activist I can be. Just look after any of my boys who pass this way. <em class="calibre6">Eniki?</em> You step out of line and there'll be a new batch of fresh blubber products at the market first thing in the morning.” He twisted the chain a little tighter. <em class="calibre6">“J'hagwa na yoka,</em> Fatboy. No trouble.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu's third eyelid flicked across his reptilian eye like a windscreen wiper. “Your pretty shiny boys die anyway, sooner or later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was <em class="calibre6">it.</em> Skirata jerked the Hutt's head down and brought his knee up in Qibbu's face as hard as he could with a wet <em class="calibre6">thwack.</em> He didn't need this <em class="calibre6">thing</em> to remind him of that and mock their sacrifice. Qibbu spluttered ammonia-scented saliva, moaning.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are we going to get good service at your establishment?” Skirata said, ignoring the pain in his kneecap. “Or would you prefer to pay me half a million creds plus nine years' interest right <em class="calibre6">now?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Tagwa, lorda.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's more like it.” He loosened his choke hold a little. “A bit of customer focus is good for business.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu balked visibly. “I lose profit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll lose a lot more than that if you mess around with me. I've always wanted to see if Hutts really can regenerate body parts.” Skirata tightened the chain again. <em class="calibre6">“Ke nu jurIcadir sha Mando'ade.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Don't mess with Mandalorians.</em> It wasn't bad advice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu was no linguist but Skirata knew tone could convey a great deal even to an animal, and maybe even to a Hutt. He hoped the lack of circulation in Qibbu's neck was translating for him.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Tagwa …</em> Sergeant,” Qibbu said, and let out a long wet gasp as Skirata released the chain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev and Scorch emerged from the turbolift again and gave Skirata the thumbs-up.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ideal for a relaxing break, Sarge,” Scorch said. “Lovely clear views, platform to park a speeder or six, and <em class="calibre6">lots</em> of room to stretch our legs. A whole floor of rooms at the top, in fact.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Good defensive visibility, easy access and escape, and the right layout for moving around and storing kit and ordnance. Excellent.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“If it's good enough for my colleagues, it'll be good enough for me,” Skirata said. “You want to take a look just to make sure, Ordo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo shook his head, still seeming wary of the Twi'lek female. “I'll go with the majority.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So, long-stay rates?” Skirata asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“As … discussed,” Qibbu said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata slid off the stool and wiped the chain clean of Qibbu's slime before coiling it and putting it in his pocket again. He was concerned about the Twi'lek, though. Civilians were hardly his prime concern on this operation, but it didn't cost anything to be courteous.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He walked over to her. She was still cowering. He squatted down almost instinctively: he saw six scared little boys waiting to be <em class="calibre6">reconditioned.</em> “I'm Kal, ma'am,” he said. “What's your name?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She didn't meet his eyes. She had that way of looking off slightly to one side that he thought he'd seen too many times before. “Laseema.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, Laseema, if your boss isn't treating you well, you let me know. And I'll have a word with him.” He smiled as best he could. “And none of my boys will give you any problems, either, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay,” she said shakily. Her lekku were moving slightly, but Skirata couldn't understand the unspoken language they conveyed. She might just have been twitching out of fear. “Okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata gave her as reassuring a smile as he could manage and moved to the doors. “We'll be back tomorrow to move some stuff in. Have the top floor ready for us, will you? Nice and clean.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And fresh flowers,” Scorch said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They ambled back to the speeder and set off for Arca Barracks, settling into an automated skylane and merging into the stream of glittering taillights. Coruscant was lovely at night, just as Fi said. Skirata had never thought about it much before.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He nudged Sev. “Good operational house, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tailor-made. It'll take us a day to move the kit in discreet amounts, but we can access via the landing platform when it's dark again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does our host get nervous about storing ordnance?” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's a Hutt,” said Skirata. “He's stored a lot worse. And what he doesn't know won't keep him awake at night.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch seemed impressed. “You really were a bit of a bad boy in your past, weren't you, Sarge?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What d'you mean, <em class="calibre6">past?”</em> Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And they laughed. They were perfect special forces troops, very bad boys in their own right, but they had never dealt with the criminal underworld—and crime was an inevitable partner of terrorism. It was one reason why Skirata didn't feel one scrap of misgiving about going bandit himself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fierfek, he'd <em class="calibre6">impressed</em> them. The Delta boys were emerging from their closed, tight-knit exclusivity and settling into the larger team. That was one problem solved.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was still the operation itself, of course.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And</em> keeping an eye on Atin, Vau, and Sev.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And</em> introducing Etain to an element of war that wasn't remotely noble.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And</em> making sure that everyone came out of it alive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reached over the back of the seat and gave Sev and Scorch a playful swat, then nudged Ordo beside him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I promised you all a night out,” he said. “When we get this cleaned up, Zey's going to get a <em class="calibre6">really</em> big mess bill from the officers' club.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe we shouldn't wait until then,” Scorch said. “You never know what's around the corner.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">No. You didn't. You never did.</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36413198" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36413199" class="calibre8"></a>9 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">When the enemy is a droid or a wet with a weapon, then killing them is easy. But in this game you're operating among civvies, on your home ground. You could be workingright next door to the enemy. They might even be people you know and like. But they're still the enemy and you'll have to slot them just the same. There's no Mandalorian word for “hero,” and that's just as well, because however many lives you save in black ops, you will never,</em> ever <em class="calibre6">be a hero. Deal with it.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–Sergeant Kal Skirata, teaching counterterrorist tactics to Republic Commando companies Alpha through Epsilon, Kamino, three years before Geonosis</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Arca Company Barracks parade ground,</strong><strong class="calibre11">0730 hours, 371 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The missile skimmed the top of Etain's head and bounced off the Force-shield she had instinctively thrown up to protect her face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik skidded to a halt in front of her, sweat dripping off the end of his nose, a flattened alloy rod clutched in one hand. There was a smear of blood across his cheek, and she wasn't sure if it was his.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry!” He looked elated. “Look, why don't you sit over there? It's safer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain indicated the blood. “And why don't you use your Force powers?” she said. “This is a dangerous sport.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's <em class="calibre6">cheating,”</em> Jusik said, lobbing the small plastoid sphere back into the knot of commandos. They pounced on the object like a hunting pack and jostled each other ferociously to whack the thing with rods, trying to drive it hard against the barrack wall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had no idea what the game was called, if it had a name at all. Nor did it seem to have any rules: the ball, such as it was, was being hit, kicked, and thrown as the whim took the players.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the teams were Niner, Scorch, Fixer, and Darman against Fi, Atin, Sev, and Boss. Skirata <em class="calibre6">insisted</em> that they played in mixed teams.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Several other commandos had paused while crossing the parade ground to watch. The battle was conducted in grim silence except for the clash of rods, gasping breath, and occasional approving shouts of <em class="calibre6">“Nar dralshy'a!”—Put your back into it!</em> —and <em class="calibre6">“Kandosii!”—</em>which<em class="calibre6">,</em> Jusik had explained, had been appropriated colloquially to mean “classy” rather than “noble.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had all become much more ferociously <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> since she had first met them. It was a phenomenon that made sense given the specific nature of their duties, but it still left her feeling that they were becoming strangers again. Working so closely with Skirata appeared to have focused their minds on a people who seemed to have the ultimate freedom.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even Darman had fallen happily into it. He was utterly engrossed in the game, shoulder-charging Boss out of the way and knocking Jusik flat. There was a shout of <em class="calibre6">“Kandosii!”</em> as the ball thudded against the wall, two meters above the ground.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Skirata emerged from the doorway. Etain didn't have to take any hints from the Force as to his state of mind.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Armor!”</em> he yelled. His voice could fill a parade ground. The commandos froze as one. He did <em class="calibre6">not</em> look amused. “I said wear some <em class="calibre6">armor!</em> No injuries! You hear me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He strode across to Jusik with surprising speed for a man with a damaged leg and came to a halt with his face centimeters from the Jedi's. He dropped his voice, but not by much.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sir, I regret to have to tell you that you're a <em class="calibre6">dik'ut.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Sergeant.” Jusik was a contrite scrap of bloody robes and sweaty hair. “My fault. Won't happen again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No injuries. Not <em class="calibre6">now.</em> Okay, sir?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Understood, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata nodded and then grinned, ruffling Jusik's hair just as he did his troops'. “You're definitely <em class="calibre6">ori'atin, Bard'ika.</em> Just don't get yourself killed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik beamed, clearly delighted. Skirata had not only told him that he was exceptionally tough, but he had used the most affectionate form of his name: now he was “Little Bardan,” and thus one of Skirata's clan. He jogged off after the commandos and disappeared inside the building.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata ambled across to Etain and sat down next to her on the bench. “He's a gutsy little <em class="calibre6">di'kut,</em> isn't he?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So it wasn't only a term of abuse, then. “If there wasn't a war on, I suspect that Master Zey would have had a serious word with him by now. Bardan's become very <em class="calibre6">attached.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Being a loner might make a warrior, but it won't make a soldier.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where were you educated?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was looking straight ahead rather than at her, and his eyes creased at the corners for a brief moment. “On the street, on the battlefield, and by a bunch of very smart little boys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain smiled. “I wasn't being rude. Just curious.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fair enough. I had to analyze and explain everything I taught my Nulls for eight years. It wasn't enough for me to show them the right way to fight. They wanted me to rationalize it. They shredded me with questions. Then they'd feed it all back to me in a way I'd never seen it before. Amazing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do we get to meet them all? Are they all like Ordo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe,” Skirata said. “They're deployed in various locations.” It was his noncommittal answer: <em class="calibre6">Don't ask.</em> “And they're all of the same caliber, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So out of a strike team of twelve, you have eleven tough <em class="calibre6">men—atin,</em> yes?—and me. I can't help feeling I'm not going to be much use.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata took out a chunk of something brown and woody and popped it into his mouth. He chewed like a gdan, as if he were gnawing off someone's arm. <em class="calibre6">'Atin'ade,”</em> he corrected. “Oh, you'll be plenty of use. I suspect you'll have the hardest job of all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whatever it takes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sergeant, is this going to become clear at the briefing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not a secret. I just want everyone to have the full picture at the same time. Then we ship out and disappear.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hear you've done that before.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Cuy'val Dar.</em> Yes, I've been 'those who no longer exist' before. You get used to it. It has its plus points.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He got up and walked toward the barracks, Etain following. His limp was far less obvious today.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How did you hurt your leg?” she asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I didn't follow orders. I ended up with a Verpine shatter gun round through my ankle. Sometimes you need to learn the hard way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Never got it fixed?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll get around to it one day. Come on, breakfast before briefing. Some things sound better on a full stomach.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">When the briefing started at 0800, Jusik looked freshly scrubbed, but he was developing a fine black eye. He also seemed delighted. Etain envied him his capacity for finding joy in the most unlikely places, just like Darman did. Omega and Delta appeared to have broken up as squads completely. They took their seats, lounging around in their black body-suits, but they no longer sat in their own tight groups. Atin and Sev still exuded a sense of distance, but Skirata's crash course in being buddies appeared to be working.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was also the small matter of the Wookiee who had walked in. Skirata directed the creature to a bigger chair and locked the doors. It was the one who'd piloted the taxi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo, have you swept the room for bugs?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this is strictly for those in this room. If anyone wants out, now's the time to say.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Observe the complete lack of movement, Sarge,” Scorch said. “Nobody's passing on this one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I didn't think so. From now on, there's no <em class="calibre6">General</em> or <em class="calibre6">sir</em> or <em class="calibre6">Sergeant</em> or designation codes, and no Jedi robes. There is no rank. There is no chain of command beyond <em class="calibre6">me.</em> If I'm otherwise engaged or <em class="calibre6">dead</em> then you answer to Ordo. Got it?” The Wookiee threw him two bundles of clothing and he lobbed one each to Etain and Jusik. She caught hers and stared at it. “Plainclothes, kids. You clone lads are just soldiers on leave, and us mongrels are … well, Etain can pass for my daughter and <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> is a useful deadbeat I picked up on my travels. A <em class="calibre6">go-fer”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The Wookiee emitted a long and contented trill. “This is Enacca, by the way.” Skirata indicated the Wookiee with a polite flourish. “She's our quartermaster and mobility troop—she'll secure supplies and transport for us. You ever worked with Wookiees?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The commandos shook their heads, wide-eyed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, everything you've heard is true.” He gestured to Ordo, and a holoprojection streamed from the ARC'S glove onto the wall. It was a chart with arrows and labels on it. “So here's what we have so far. One, we have a point of origin for the explosives. Two, we think we have someone in GAR logistics or support, or in the CSF, who is either passing information or being careless with it. Now, what we <em class="calibre6">don't</em> have is a link in the chain between the following terror cells: materials to bomb manufacture; bomb manufacture to placement cell; and placement cell to recce and surveillance cell—in other words, the ones who tell them where to place the device and when to detonate it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had his projection arm resting on his chair. “And Vau is trying to extract at least one link from the cell Omega lifted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But they might not even know what that link is,” Skirata said. “It's common to use the equivalent of a dead letter drop to deliver stuff. The prisoners tested positive for explosives, so they might be the manufacturers, but I'd assume the devices are made on Coruscant because it's simpler to ship bulk explosives than complete bombs, given that you can't pretend bombs are for mining use, although neither is easy. So our best guess is that they're the procurement cell that buys the raw material.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik had his head cocked on one side. “I take it that if we don't know this after a day, then Vau is not having much success with his interrogation. May I volunteer to help him? Jedi have some persuasive powers as well as ways of uncovering facts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know,” Skirata said. “That's why Etain's going to do it. I need you out and about at the moment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain's stomach somersaulted. <em class="calibre6">Is this a test?</em> Jusik was watching her cautiously: he could definitely sense her discomfort. Perhaps he had tried to do the decent thing and save her from the duty. Or perhaps he was so caught up in being one of the boys that he really wanted to have a crack at a prisoner. Jusik had his own wary relationship with the dark side, it seemed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay,” Etain said. <em class="calibre6">You've killed. You've killed hand-to-hand, and you've killed by unleashing missiles. On Qiilura, under deep cover, you stabbed and crushed and cut, and taught the local guerrillas to do the same. And now you worry about manipulating minds?</em> “I'll do whatever I can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good,” Skirata said, and moved on as if she had simply volunteered to cook dinner. “Now, the data Atin sliced is just a list of thirty-five thousand companies using the freight service that Vau's guests were apparently hitching a ride with. That means a lot of physical checking we can't do ourselves. So Obrim's running it through his database—his personal, special one—to see if any of them have form in customs irregularities, shady dealings, or even a speeding ticket. While he does that, we ship out. Jusik, Enacca is going to turn you into the galaxy's scruffiest taxi pilot, and the rest of you can draw your <em class="calibre6">extra</em> kit—by which I mean discreet body armor, plainclothes rig, and civilian weapons.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Aww, Sarge …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, you'll love it. You might even get to wear Hokan's helmet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just for you, then, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good boy. Okay, we all RV back here at twenty-one-hundred hours when it's nice and dark.” Skirata gestured to Ordo to kill the holoprojection and then beckoned to Etain. “General, Ordo—with me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He led them into the passage and, instead of taking her into a quiet alcove to discuss matters, simply hurried her down the length of the corridor and out onto the parade ground, where yet another battered speeder with darkened transparisteel windscreens was waiting.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you starting up a used-speeder dealership with Enacca?” Jokes always seemed to work for Fi, but Etain found they offered her no comfort at all. “They don't draw attention, though, I'll admit that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get in. Time to go to work.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Like the clone army, she had become very good at following orders. Ordo took the speeder at a sedate pace into the main skylanes and dropped it into a gap in a route heading south.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is where it gets difficult, Etain,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">In a way, she knew what was coming. “Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is harder than taking on a column of battle droids and playing the hero.” Skirata was still chewing the ruik. She could smell it on his breath, sweet and floral. “I won't insult your intelligence. I want you to torture a man. It's the first intelligence break we've had in months and we need to make the most of it. Men died making sure we got those prisoners.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wasn't sure if it was a test of her loyalty or not. It was certainly something that Skirata knew would be the ultimate line for a Jedi to cross. But Jedi crossed the lines of decency all the time, and it was supposed to be fine as long as you didn't commit violence out of anger, or dare to love.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was finding it harder to follow her path than ever before, and yet she was now clearer about her own convictions than she had ever been in her life.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was aware of Ordo, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He appeared perfectly calm in the pilot's seat, but the eddies and deep dark pools in the Force around him spoke of a man who was <em class="calibre6">not</em> at ease with himself or the world. Great peaks of fear and pain and helpless trust and desolation and … and … <em class="calibre6">sheer overwhelming speed</em> and complexity hit Etain like a spray of cold water. He felt as foreign as a Hutt or a Weequay or a Twi'lek.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was a man in frequent agony. His mind was racing at full throttle, and it felt as if it never stopped.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She must have been staring at him. “Are you all right, ma'am?” he asked, still veneered in calm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm fine,” she said, swallowing hard. “What … what can I possibly do that Walon Vau can't?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you ready to hear some unpleasant things?” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have to be.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He rubbed his forehead slowly. “You can train people to resist interrogation. That's a fancy phrase for torture, and I don't like using it. I know, because I've done it, and hard-line terrorists get trained much like soldiers do. But they don't get trained to resist <em class="calibre6">Jedi.</em> And that gives you a psychological advantage as well as a real one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nikto are supposed to be tough.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Humans can be tough, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He seemed distressed. It was severe enough for her to feel the Force around him become that dark vortex again. “Kal, who's finding this more unpleasant, you or me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It comes back to you at times like this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So who … trained Omega?” She felt the faintest shimmer of distress in Ordo now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me,” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Would you have let anyone else do it if you were me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No.” She knew immediately; she didn't even have to think about it. It would have been an act of abandonment, letting someone else do the dirty work to salve your own conscience, with the same outcome. “No, I wouldn't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well …” He shut his eyes for a moment. “If I can <em class="calibre6">train</em> my boys, then you should have no trouble doing what Vau can't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell me what's at stake.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“For who? The Republic?” Kal asked. “I think it's marginal, to be honest. In real terms, terrorism doesn't even dent it. Casualties in the thousands, that's all. It's fear of it that does the damage.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So why are you in so deep?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Who's getting hit hardest? Clone troopers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But thousands of troops are dying in the front line every day. Numerically—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, I can't do much about the war. I trained quite a few men to stay alive. But all that's left for me is to do what I can, where I can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Personal war, isn't it?” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You think so? I don't care if the Republic falls or not. I'm a mercenary. Everyone's my potential employer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So where does the anger come from? I know anger, you see. As Jedi we guard against it all the time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You won't like the answer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't like a lot of things lately, but I still have to deal with them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. Day by day, I get more bitter when I see Mandalorian men—and that's what they are, whether you like it or not—used and discarded in a war in which they have <em class="calibre6">no stake.”</em> Skirata, sitting right behind Ordo, put his hand gently on the captain's armored shoulder. “But not on my watch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had no answer to that. She hadn't articulated it in racial terms, and she knew that Mandalorians weren't a race as such. But there hadn't been one day since she had parted from Omega Squad on Qiilura nine months ago that she hadn't agonized over the use of soldiers who had no choice, no rights, and no future in the Republic that they gave their lives to defend.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was <em class="calibre6">wrong.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a point somewhere at which the means did <em class="calibre6">not</em> justify the ends, no matter what the numbers argued. Like this violent, passionate little man beside her, Etain didn't refuse her role in the war out of principle, because that would have been no more than shutting her eyes to it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Men would still die.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And if the Jedi Council could accept the need to let that happen to save the Republic, then she could sink to a level she had never believed possible to save soldiers she knew as people.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll try not to let you down,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You mean <em class="calibre6">me?”</em> said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And</em> you, she thought.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Safe house, Brewery zone, Coruscant Quadrant J-47, </strong><strong class="calibre11">1000 hours, 371 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata had been expecting the safe house to be in another seedy part of the city where unusual activity was part of the landscape.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Enacca had surpassed herself this time. The property was a small apartment in a refurbished quarter known as the Brewery; the construction droids were still working on some of the buildings, facing them with tasteful durasteel wrought-work. Zey was going to have a fit when he saw the bill for this one land on his desk.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think that's what our brothers might call <em class="calibre6">kandosii,”</em> Ordo said, bringing the speeder up to the landing platform. It had a discreet awning to shield it from view, although Coruscant was so traffic-packed that enemy surveillance from tall buildings—Skirata's dread—was less of a threat than usual here. Lines of sight were frequently obscured. “I'll be back later. Errands to run, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">When the lobby doors closed behind them, the constant throb and hum of Coruscant was completely silenced. <em class="calibre6">Ah. Top-range soundproofing.</em> Enacca was a very smart Wookiee. Vau's job could be noisy. There was no point upsetting the neighbors in cheaper parts of town that had less efficient soundproofing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it was the last place Orjul's colleagues would come looking for him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had her arms folded tightly across her chest, her light brown wavy hair scraped back in a braid except for the wiry bits that had escaped and sprung into coils. Even her new civilian clothes already looked as if she had slept in them. She had a veil of freckles and an awkward gait; just a schoolgirl armed with a lightsaber, nothing more.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You up to this, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika?”</em> Little one: Skirata slipped accidentally into being the reassuring father. But he reserved judgment. Like him, she might just have made a point of looking a lot less trouble than she actually was. “If not, walk away <em class="calibre6">now”.</em> And if she did, what would he have to do? She already knew dangerous numbers of people and places.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. I'm not backing out now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He thought she might suddenly reveal a powerful charisma or sweetness that would explain why this scrap of skin, bone, and unkempt hair had so riveted Darman. But she was just a kid, a Jedi kid with a lot of responsibility that showed in her young face and old eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata pressed on the entry buzzer into the main apartment, and after a moment the doors whispered apart. The strong smell that hit him on the moist air reminded him of walking into a barn full of frightened animals. It was so distinctive that he almost didn't notice the scent of the strill. But Mird was nowhere to be seen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau, sitting at the table, looked tired. He still seemed like a professor who wasn't very happy with his class, but the physical effort showed in deeper lines from nose to mouth and the way he was drumming his fingers on the table in front of him. It was his trick for staying awake.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The man who had his head resting on the same table in front of him didn't look awake at all. Vau leaned forward and lifted the man's head by his hair, peered into his face, and set him down carefully again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're the relief watch, then, Jedi?” Vau got up and stretched extravagantly, joints clicking, and indicated the empty chair. “All yours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain looked surprised. Skirata had expected her to register horror at the blood spatter on the otherwise pristine cream walls, but she just looked at Vau as if she was expecting to see someone else.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where are the other two?” Skirata asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nikto number one is M'truli, and he's secured in the small bedroom.” Vau was perfectly polite: this was just business after all, and even Skirata felt too centered on the task at hand to resume their feud where it had left off. “Nikto number two is Gysk, and he's in the study.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your tunic could do with a wash.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's the little horns. You can't punch a Nikto. Had to use something else.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain sat down in Vau's seat and placed her hands flat on the table, still looking puzzled. Skirata leaned against the wall. Vau wandered into the 'fresher: water tinkled into a basin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You want to tell me what you know,” Etain said soothingly. “You want to give me the names of the people you operate with.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Orjul twitched. He raised his head from the table with some difficulty and stared into her face for a second.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he spat in it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain jerked back, visibly shocked, and wiped away the pink-stained spittle with one hand. Then she composed herself again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Keep your stinking mind tricks to yourself, Jedi,” Orjul hissed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't expect her to break at that point. And she didn't: she simply sat there, although he knew it wasn't blank inactivity. She had been trained from childhood just like the clone army, except the first weapon she seized would be her control of the Force and her ability to read it like clamoring comlink signals.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman had told him. <em class="calibre6">She could tell us apart right away by how we felt and thought, Sarge. Wouldn't that be a handy trick to have?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can I see the Nikto?” she asked suddenly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau came out of the 'fresher, wiping his face on a fluffy white towel. “Help yourself.” He gave Skirata a <em class="calibre6">you-know best</em> look and unlocked the doors for her. “They're securely trussed. You know we keep them from talking to each other, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I worked that out,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She disappeared into one room for a minute and then came out and went into the other. When she emerged again, she walked up to Skirata and Vau and lowered her head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm pretty sure those Nikto have no information, and <em class="calibre6">know</em> they don't have it,” she said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“People have useful information all the time and don't know it,” Skirata said. “We piece the apparently useless stuff together and come up with connections.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What I mean is that they have this distinct sense that they're just afraid of dying.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau shrugged. “So much for Nikto grit, eh?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Every creature avoids death. The difference is that Orjul is afraid of <em class="calibre6">breaking.</em> It feels different to me. It's not animal dread. It's not as deep in the Force.” Etain had her fingers meshed in that Jedi way that made her look as if she were wringing her hands. “I might as well concentrate on him. He has information he's afraid to reveal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They watched her walk the few meters back to the main room and settle down at the table opposite Orjul again and stare at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau shrugged. “Oh well. At least I can have a nap while she's minding the shop. Then I can get back to work with more <em class="calibre6">tangible</em> methods.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a sharp gasp from Orjul and Vau looked around. Whatever Etain was doing, she wasn't even touching him. Just <em class="calibre6">staring.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, <em class="calibre6">those</em> people scare me more than Orjul does,” Vau said. “I'm just going to get my head down for a couple of hours. Wake me if she gets anywhere—or kills him, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was about 1030 in the morning, when people were going about mundane business in the city. It felt like an odd time of day to be conducting an interrogation. Skirata somehow felt they were always carried out in some permanent night.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And Etain showed every sign of being up to the task.</div>

<div class="paragraph">From time to time, she would lower her head as if to try to get a better view of Orjul's expression while he sat facedown at the table, fingers knotted in his pale hair as if he had a blinding headache. Skirata wanted to ask her what she was doing to him but he was worried it would break her concentration.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And she was fixed completely on the task in hand. Her blink rate had slowed so much that she appeared to be frozen, except for the pulse in her throat. Orjul would occasionally pant and squeal, writhing as if he were attempting to crawl into the very surface of the table.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata walked away and went to stare at the Nikto for a while. When he came back into the room, Orjul was making little hiccupping sobs. Etain, face level with his, was talking quietly to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can you see it, Orjul? Can you see what happens?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata watched.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Orjul …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The man whined exactly like a strill, a thin animal noise. “I can't …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fear of being wrong is worse than pain, isn't it? It just eats you and you can't shut it off. Are you right? Or are you as bad as the Republic you hate? Are we really the enemy, or are you? Look at the helpless pawns you kill.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So <em class="calibre6">that</em> was what she was doing. Skirata had wondered if she was using her Force powers to cause real physical pain. But she had cut to the chase and re-created the stuff that pain did to you anyway: it made you fear for your sanity long before your life.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had to hand it to her. It was nonlethal and not that far beyond the usual mind influence. Maybe she was struggling to find an ethical limit in her own mind. Maybe it was her own nightmare, the worst thing she could conceive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She kept it up for an hour. He had no idea whether she was suggesting terrible images and consequences in his mind, or if she was simply flooding him with adrenaline against his wishes, but whatever it was it was exhausting him and her with it. Eventually Orjul broke down sobbing, and Etain shuddered and looked disoriented as if coming out of a trance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata grabbed Vau's shoulder and shook him awake. “Get in there. She's broken him down enough for you to finish the job.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau looked at his chrono. “Not bad. What's up? Don't want to let her face the real consequences?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just do it, will you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau swung his legs off the bed and stalked into the main room to usher Etain from the chair and steer her and Skirata toward the doors. “Go and have some fizzadc, Jedi.” He turned to Orjul, who was staring after Etain with wide-set eyes. “She's just stepping out for some refreshment. She'll be back later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata caught Etain's elbow. He wasn't used to grabbing small people: his lads were solid muscle, bigger and stronger than Etain. He felt as if he were clutching a kid's arm. He sat her down on the little bench at the back of the landing platform and took out his comlink to call for transport.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I'm going back in,” said Etain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only if Vau calls us back.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only if he really needs you. Okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were still waiting for Ordo to collect them when Etain flinched and then looked back at the lobby doors.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They opened and Vau wandered out, rubbing his eyes. There was a distinctive tang of ozone clinging to him, like a discharged blaster.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Retail zone, Quadrant B-Eighty-five,” said Vau simply. He held out his datapad with coordinates. “But he hasn't given me a date, if he knows one. He was supposed to drop the explosives off in the warehouse, and someone would be along to collect it. He never knew who.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sniffed the ozonic scent again and switched to <em class="calibre6">Mando'a,</em> although he was sure Etain had flinched because she had sensed what had happened.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Gar ru kyramu kaysh, di'kut: tion'meh kaysh ru jehaati?”</em> You killed him, you moron: what if he was lying?</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau made an irritated pfft sound. <em class="calibre6">“Ni ru kyramu Niktose. Meh Orjul jehaati, kaysh kar'tayli me'ni ven kyramu kaysh.”</em> I killed the Nikto. If Orjul's lying, he knows I'll kill him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Orjul would be dead sooner or later anyway. No prisoners: not on this run. It was amazing how many people overlooked the inevitable while hoping for a way out.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain said nothing. She almost bolted for the speeder when Ordo settled it down on the platform. Skirata settled beside her. She simply seemed subdued.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Result?” Ordo said calmly, helmet on the seat beside him, eyes straight ahead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Potential drop-off location,” said Skirata. “Someone might be expecting to collect a stash of explosives. So we'd better have something ready for them to collect.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Intel doesn't suggest they've noticed the loss of the consignment yet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, if the cells are as isolated for security reasons as we think, then there's nobody to notice for a while, is there?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's the small matter of getting hold of a cache of explosives, but we could make this work for us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can hear the cogs working, son.” Skirata patted Etain's hand. “And you did fine, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.”</em> Ordo glanced over his shoulder and then appeared to realize that Skirata meant Etain, not him, this time. There was no gender in <em class="calibre6">Mando'a.</em> “It's never easy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She accepted his touch without reaction, and then seized to his hand so tightly that he thought she was going to burst into tears or protest. But she maintained the facade of calm, except for that desperate grip on his hand. He had always been a soft touch for a desperate child's grasp.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sowing doubt is a very corrosive thing when you're dealing with people who believe in causes,” said Etain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata decided he'd have no trouble treating her as his daughter. He forgot his real, estranged daughter all too often. He'd enjoyed returning to little Ruusaan's excited welcome, but each time he came home from a war, wherever home happened to be, she was unrecognizably older and less excited to see him, as if she didn't know him at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">But I have sons.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's why I stick to causes nobody can take from me,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A Mandalorian's identity and soul depended only on what lived within him. And he relied only on his brother warriors—or his sons.</div>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Clone troopers are well disciplined. Even the Alpha-batch ARC troopers—surly though they are—are predictable, in the sense that Fett gave them precise orders that they continue to obey. But the commando batches are almost as unpredictable as the Nulls, and the Nulls are as good as being Skirata private army. That's the problem with having intelligent clones trained by a ragbag of undisciplined thugs—they've turned out at best idiosyncratic, at worst disobedient. But they'll probably win the war for us. Tolerate them.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–Assessment of Republic Commando cadre by Director of Special Forces general Arligan Zey, explaining discrepancies in stores and armory inventory to General Iri Camas</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Qibbu's Hut, entertainment sector—strike team operational</strong><strong class="calibre11">house—early evening, 371 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is plain <em class="calibre6">unnatural,”</em> Boss said. He stood in front of the mirror. “I can't help noticing what this body armor <em class="calibre6">doesn't</em> cover.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It covers your torso and thighs, and that's where your major blood vessels and organs are.” Atin tugged at his tunic. They had all defaulted to GAR-issue fatigues, the standard red tunic and pants. Outside the barracks, the casual rig made Fi feel ludicrously naked. “That's all you need. See? Doesn't show under fabric.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can live without an arm,” Fi said. “They can always bolt on a new one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about my <em class="calibre6">head?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like I said, they can always replace nonessential parts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss didn't even look up from the inspection of his tunic. “I love this guy. He'll make such great target practice.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had a point: they were fighting without helmets. <em class="calibre6">That</em> was going to be tough. Everyone from clone trooper to ARC captain lived by his bucket. The <em class="calibre6">buy'ce</em> was a command and control center in itself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi picked up a coil of razor-sharp wire and stretched it out between his hands. Skirata had taught him to use this: a garrote, flicked around the neck—if your target had a neck—and pulled tight to slice or choke. There were all kinds of interesting devices and techniques that Skirata recommended. Other instructors had their own favorites, according to their commando training batches, but Kars were clearly close-range, personal ones. What was it he used to say? <em class="calibre6">You need to be able to fight if you're cornered in just your underpants, son. Nature gave you teeth and fists.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Sergeant Kal sounded as if he knew <em class="calibre6">exactly</em> how that felt. He certainly knew his techniques.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The main room at the top of the seedy hotel—hastily soundproofed with a micro-anechoic coating over the walls and windows—was filling with jostling bodies. Jusik bounced in, clearly pleased with himself, and laid out a row of small beads and devices on the scratched black duraplast table. Atin wandered over and peered at the haul.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where'd you get all that, Bardan?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik trapped one of the beads on his fingertip and held it out to Atin. Fi moved in. Whatever it was, he wanted one, too. “ARC trooper aural stand-alone comlink. One each. No need for your <em class="calibre6">buy'cese</em> or anything too obvious—just stick it in your ear. Plus …” The Jedi took out a small transparent sac of what looked like powdered permaglass. “Tracking marker.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Never seen it before.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Brand new from the labs. It's called Dust. Microscopic transmitters. Scattered on a battlefield for pretty much invisible monitoring. You never know when you might need it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You liberated all that from stores?” asked Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And Procurement Development. It all ended up in my pockets somehow.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Captain Maze is going to go spare.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's okay. Ordo can explain the necessity to him later. He <em class="calibre6">listens</em> to Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where's Skirata?” Sev asked. “Maybe they're having trouble cracking the prisoners.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not Vau.” Fixer pocketed a comlink bead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why did he need Etain, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe to show her how it's done.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi watched Darman bristle. He waited for his brother to say something, but Dar swallowed whatever retort was forming and went on fussing with the fit of the armor plates under his tunic. It wasn't exactly a secret that he had a soft spot for Etain, but nobody teased him about it, either. It was one of those aspects of life that Skirata had taught them about, but that none of them entertained much hope of pursuing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was easy back on Kamino, where the real world had never intruded—not beyond the risk of getting killed in training, of course. But the last nine months' exposure to people outside the tight fraternity had made ordinary life feel much more dangerous than combat itself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Because other people's lives were <em class="calibre6">not</em> ordinary at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi went to the window, now obscured by a fine film of anti-surveillance gauze, and watched the promenade of tourists and locals along the walkways facing Qibbu's Hut. He didn't envy them their day-to-day existence: Skirata had told his commando batch just how grim and dreary it could be to earn a living, and how much cleaner it was to have a clear purpose in life.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he hadn't told them how it might feel to watch couples and families of all species. Skirata stuck to the basics. <em class="calibre6">I've been kicked out by so many females that I can't tell you anything useful about relationships, so just avoid them if you can.</em> Again, it struck the class as something he said and didn't mean—like the way he called them Wet Droids and said they were here to fight, not socialize. It just meant it was a painful topic for him to face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He also called them Dead Men. But they were not Dead Men any longer. They had learned to be Mandalorian, and that, Kal said, meant they had a soul and a place in the Mando eternity. Fi thought that was probably worth having.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The doors opened and all eight commandos spun around to train a motley collection of modified civilian blasters on the opening. Security code or not, you could never be too careful. Skirata entered with Ordo and Etain at his heels. The squads lowered their weapons.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Been shopping,” Skirata said cheerfully. And he meant it. Fi expected it to be his usual euphemism for acquiring illicit weapons—or worse—but it seemed he really <em class="calibre6">had</em> been buying things. He tipped a bag of assorted fruit, candies, ices, nuts, and other delicacies that Fi couldn't identify onto the table next to Jusik's haul. “Go on. Fill yer boots.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta hung back. Omega didn't. Then Delta appeared to remember that fill <em class="calibre6">yer boots</em> meant “eat your fill.” Fi peeled bright green wrapping from something that smelled of sour fruits and found it to be frozen and covered in something appetizingly crunchy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Etain looked tired. Jusik was watching her warily as if something unspoken was going on between them. Jedi could do that kind of thing, just like soldiers on helmet comlinks, silent to the outside world. Then Etain muttered something about having a hot soak in the 'freshers and disappeared into the next room.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We have a drop location,” Skirata said. “And a few thousand or so clone troopers on leave for a few weeks thanks to our totally unexpected friend Mar Rugeyan.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mmm, crushed nuts,” Fi said, identifying the topping on the ice. “That was very helpful of him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They all stopped in midcrunch. Fi noted Jusik wasn't eating, just watching the sergeant with a rapt expression. The young general had a very bad dose of the Skiratas. As diseases went, it was one of the best to catch.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So do we get to drop <em class="calibre6">them,</em> or do we have to do the boring thing and let them stroll off?” Boss asked. Niner gave him one of his funny looks, the kind that said he thought a bit of quiet contemplation was called for. Niner and Boss didn't see their newly reduced roles in quite the same way: Niner liked to lead by being certain, and Boss seemed to like being <em class="calibre6">first.</em> “This is a tracking job, right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau made you into very impatient boys,” Skirata said. “Yes, this is where it gets boring. And you know what? You won't be any less dead if you get it wrong.” He picked up some shuura fruits and lobbed one each to the Delta team. “And I really hope Vau schooled you well in this, because I'll be pretty hacked off if you get trigger-happy and blow this op.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss looked hurt. Fi didn't think Delta ran to such delicate emotions. “We're pros, Sarge. We know how to do this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What did I tell you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry. <em class="calibre6">Kal.</em> It's just that we haven't even seen the enemy yet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Welcome to anti-terror ops, hotshot. They aren't droids. They don't line up and march at you. Didn't you listen to <em class="calibre6">any</em> of my lectures?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They can kill you and not even be on the planet when it happens. But you can track and kill them the same way. This is about patience and attention to detail.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta's really good at that, so I hear,” Fi said. Sev gave him that blank cold stare. It simply provoked Fi all the more. “That's why they do their op planning with finger paints.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata lobbed a rolled-up ball of flimsi at Fi and it hit him in the ear—hard. “Okay, Ordo is going to score some credible explosives over the next few days, because that's going to be handy if we need to infiltrate the cells. And we'll start surveillance of the drop point now because we don't have a time window when the explosives were due to be picked up. Four shifts—Fi and Sev as Red Watch, relieved by Dar and Boss as Blue Watch, relieved by Niner and Scorch as Green Watch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi noted Atin's process of elimination. He looked as if he'd been doused in cold water. Fi suspected he'd wanted to be paired with Sev, and for all the wrong reasons.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That leaves you and <em class="calibre6">Fixer as</em> White Watch, so you stay focused,” Skirata said, giving Atin a friendly prod in the chest. He'd spotted it, too. But then, Skirata spotted <em class="calibre6">everything.</em> “One watch on observation, one on intel collation, and two stood down.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about everyone else?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo's going undercover to find our mole, and Bardan and Etain will join the normal shift rotations until we need to break into a new phase. If needed, Vau and Enacca will turn to as well, and give us a hand.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik—looking convincingly unsavory in ordinary clothing and with his hair unbound—checked his snazzy S-5 blaster. Yes, Zey <em class="calibre6">would</em> go nuts when he saw the bill for this op. “Can we use the Force, Kal?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“ 'Course you can, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika.</em> As long as nobody notices. Or as long as you don't leave witnesses, anyway. Same goes for lightsabers. No witnesses. Might look a bit obvious.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When do we start?” Boss asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata looked at his chrono. “Three hours. Time to eat, I think.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev elbowed Fi, a little too hard to be friendly but not hard enough to start a fight. “So, you and me. The brains and the mouth. Don't get me killed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm slumming it. I usually work with ARC captains.” <em class="calibre6">Watching normal people leading normal lives? I'd rather charge a droid line. What happened to my certainty? Do the others feel like this?</em> “But there's a war on, so sacrifices have to be made.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can you do the dumb-trooper act?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You mean you're not doing it now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hope you're as good as you talk, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Count on it,” Fi said, and noted that Darman had wandered off in the direction of Etain's exit. “Sometimes I'm not very funny at all.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">* * *</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Etain felt she had held out pretty well, all things considered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was only when she closed the refresher door that she let herself vomit uncontrollably until tears spilled down her face and into her mouth. She ran water into the basin to cover the sound, and choked on her sobs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She'd been so convinced she could handle it. And she <em class="calibre6">couldn't.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ripping into Orjul's soul had been even harder than outright physical violence. She had stolen his conviction from him, which was no great evil until set in the context of the fact that he would, she knew, die very soon without even the comfort of his beliefs, broken and abandoned and <em class="calibre6">alone.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Why am I doing this? Because men are dying.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">When do the ends cease to justify the means?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She vomited until she was convulsed by dry heaves. Then she filled the basin with cold water and plunged her head into it. When she straightened up and her vision cleared, she looked into a face she recognized. But it wasn't hers: it was the hard, long face of Walon Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Everything I've been taught is wrong.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau was all brutality and expedience, as clear an example of the dark side for a Jedi as any she could imagine. And yet there was a total absence of conscious malice in him. She should have sensed anger and murderous intent, but Vau was just filled with … nothing. No, not <em class="calibre6">nothing:</em> he was actually calm and benign. He thought he was <em class="calibre6">doing good work.</em> And she saw her supposed Jedi ideal in him—motivated not by anger or fear, but by what she thought was <em class="calibre6">right.</em> She now questioned everything she'd been taught.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Dark and light are simply the perpetrator's perception. How can that be right?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">How can Vau's passionless expedience be morally superior to Ski rata's anger and love?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had struggled for years with her own anger and resentment. The choices were to be a good Jedi or a failed Jedi, with the assumption—sometimes unspoken, sometimes not—that failure meant the dark side awaited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But there <em class="calibre6">was</em> a third path: to leave the Order.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wiped her face on the towel and faced a hard realization. She remained a Jedi because she knew no other life. She pitied Orjul not because she had tortured him, but because he had been robbed of the one thing that held him together, his convictions, without which he had no direction. The truth was that she pitied <em class="calibre6">herself—devoid</em> of direction—and projected it onto her victim by way of denial.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">The only selfless thing I have ever done that was not centered on my own need to be a good, passionless, detached Jedi was to care about these cloned men and ask what we're doing to them.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And <em class="calibre6">that</em> was her direction.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was so very clear; but she was still raw and aching within. Revelation didn't heal. She sat on the edge of the tub with her head resting on her knees.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ma'am, what's wrong?” It was Darman's voice. It should have been the same as every other clone's, but it wasn't. They all had their distinct nuances in accent, pitch, and tone. And he was <em class="calibre6">Dar.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She could sense Darman across star systems now. She'd wanted to reach out to him in the Force many times, but feared it might distract him from his duty and endanger him, or—if he knew it was her and didn't welcome it—annoy him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">After all, he'd had the choice of staying on Qiilura with her. And he had opted to stay with his squad. What she felt for him now, the longing that had developed only after they parted, might not be mutual.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He called out again. “Are you okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She opened the doors, and Darman peered in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't want to be <em class="calibre6">ma'am</em> right now, Dar.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He moved a couple of steps into the room as if it were booby-trapped. She had been here before; she had been utterly dependent on his military skills when her life was at stake. He had been so focused, so reassuring, so competent. Where she had doubts, he had certainties.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you still don't find it any easier, then,” said Darman.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Giving in to anger. You know. Violence.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, any Jedi Master would have been proud of me. I did it all without anger. Anger makes it the dark side. Being serene makes it okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know it must have been hard. I know how Sergeant Kal reacted when he had to—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. I was harming a stranger. No personal dilemma at all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It doesn't make you a bad person. It has to be done. Is that what's upsetting you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That, maybe. And having doubts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She didn't want to be alone with all that in her head. She could have meditated. She had the strength of will and the ancient skills to pass through this turmoil and do what Jedi had done for millennia—detach from the moment. But she didn't want to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wanted to risk living with those terrible feelings. The danger suddenly seemed to lie in denying them, just as she tried unsuccessfully to deny what she felt for Darman.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dar, do you ever have doubts? You always said you were certain of your role. I always felt you were.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You really want to know?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have doubts all the time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What kind?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Before we left Kamino, I was so sure what I had to do. Now … well, the more I see of the galaxy … the more I see of other people, the more I wonder, why me? How did I end up here, and not like the people I see around me in Coruscant? When we win the war, what will happen to me and my brothers?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They weren't stupid. They were highly intelligent: bred for it, in fact, and if you bred people to be intelligent and resourceful and resilient and aggressive, then sooner or later they would notice that their world wasn't fair, and begin to resent it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I ask that, too,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It makes me feel disloyal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not disloyal to question things.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's dangerous, though,” Darman said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“For the status quo?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sometimes you can't argue with everything. Like orders. You don't have the full picture of the battle, and the order you ignore might just be the one that should have saved your life.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I'm glad you have doubts. And I'm glad I do, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman leaned against the wall, all concern. “Do you want something to eat? We're going to risk Qibbu's nerf in glockaw sauce. Scorch reckons it's probably armored rat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not sure I can face crowds right now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You might be overestimating the popularity of Qibbu's cuisine.” He shrugged. “I could probably get the cook to stun the thing with my Deece and send it up by room service.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was Darman all over: he had a relentlessly positive nature. It was her job to inspire him, but he'd been the one on Qiilura who had made her get up and fight time after time. He'd changed her forever. She wondered if he had any idea how much he was still changing her life now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay,” she said. “But only if you keep me company.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, eating armored rat alone is probably asking for trouble.” He grinned suddenly, and she felt illuminated by it. “You might need first aid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner's voice interrupted from down the passage. “Dar, you coming with us or what? Fi and Sev are supposed to be on watch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I'll get something sent up. They can head on down with you. We'll do the duty.” Darman cocked his head as if to listen for some rebuke. “That okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">This time it was Skirata's voice. “Two <em class="calibre6">steaks?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Please.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not something safe, like eggs?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Steaks. We fear <em class="calibre6">nothing.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Suddenly Etain felt an urge to laugh. Fi might have been the comedian, but Dar was genuinely uplifting. He wasn't trying to suppress pain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She also found him distractingly handsome, even though he looked identical to his brothers. She adored them as friends, but they were <em class="calibre6">not</em> Darman, and somehow they didn't even look like him. Nobody else ever would be that precious to her, she knew that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, what shall we do now?” he asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not lightsaber training, for a start.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You really whacked me with that branch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You told me I had to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you take orders from clones, do you, General?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You kept me alive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah, you'd have done fine without me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Actually, no,” said Etain. “Actually, I wouldn't have done fine at all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She looked him in the eye for a few moments, hoping that Darman the man would react to her, but he simply stared back, a bewildered boy again. “I'd never been that close to a human female before. Did you know that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I guessed as much?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't even sure if Jedi were … real flesh and blood.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wonder sometimes, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wasn't scared of dying.” He put his hands to his head for a moment and then raked his fingers through his hair, that gesture she'd seen in Skirata. “I was afraid because I didn't know what I was feeling and—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The service droid buzzed to be let in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek.” Darman's shoulders sagged a little. He got up and took the tray from the droid, looking pink-faced and annoyed. He peeled back the lids and inspected the contents as if they were unstable explosives, and she felt the moment was now lost.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is it dead?” Etain asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If it isn't, it's not getting up again anytime soon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She chewed a test-mouthful thoughtfully. “Could be worse.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ration cubes …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, <em class="calibre6">that</em> brings back memories.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now you know why we'll eat <em class="calibre6">anything.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I remember the bread, too. Ugh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He prodded something in the container with his fork, looking concerned. “You <em class="calibre6">did</em> reach out to me in the Force, didn't you? I wasn't imagining that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, I did.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Isn't it obvious?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How would I know? I'm not sure if I know that much about you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think you do, Dar.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman suddenly took exceptional interest in the remains of the steak, which might have been nerf after all. “I don't think anyone believed females would matter to us, given our life expectancy. And it wasn't relevant to combat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was freshly agonizing. Of all the injustices piled on these clones who had never been given choices, that was the worst: the denial of any individual future, of hope itself. If they beat the odds of battle, they were still doomed to lose the war against time. Darman would probably be dead in thirty years, and she wouldn't even be halfway through her life by then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I bet Kal thought it was important.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman chewed his lip and averted his gaze. She wasn't sure if he was embarrassed or if he simply didn't know what she was really asking.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He never mentioned what to do about <em class="calibre6">generals,”</em> he said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My Master never specifically mentioned soldiers, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hear you ignore orders anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was afraid I'd never see you again, Dar. But you're here now, and that's all that matters.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She held her hand out to him. He hesitated for a moment and then reached across the table and took it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We could be dead tomorrow, both of us,” she said. “Or the next day, or next week. That's war.” She thought of the other Fi, whose life had ebbed away in her arms. “And I don't want to die without telling you that I missed you every day since you left, and that I love you, and that I don't believe what I was taught about attachment any more than you should believe that you were bred only to die for the Republic.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">This was breaking all the rules.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But the war had broken all the rules of peacekeeping Jedi and a civilized Republic anyway. The Force wouldn't be thrown into turmoil if a mediocre Jedi and a cloned soldier who had no rights broke just one more.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I never stopped thinking about you, either,” said Darman. “Not for a moment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So … how long does it take two squads to finish their meals in the bar?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Long enough, I think,” said Darman.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Retail sector, Quadrant B-85, nine days later, observation </strong><strong class="calibre11">vehicle in position overlooking warehouse space, </strong><strong class="calibre11">1145 hours, 380 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Jusik was enjoying himself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So,” he said, and let the trendy dark visor slide down his nose so he could look over the top. “Do I look like a low-life taxi pilot?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Pretty convincing,” Fi said. He wondered if Jusik ever had the sense to be scared. “Do I look like a fare?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev, sitting beside Jusik in the taxi's front seat, had a detached DC-17 scope balanced on the vessel's console and patched into a datapad by a thin yellow wire. He was <em class="calibre6">pinging,</em> as Skirata called it. Each time a delivery transport or other craft passed through the dead-end canyon of warehouses that lay beneath the retail levels above, Sev checked the registration transponder against CSF's database. He also checked the cargo with the scope's sensor scan.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was impressed by the ease with which Fixer and Atin had set up the remote link without CSF spotting it. They hadn't even had to call in Ordo to sort it out. Ordo had melted into the city again two days ago, no mean feat for an ARC trooper captain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi tried not to wonder where he might be. It was bad enough thinking about Sicko.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, that one was routine. Garment delivery.” Sev made a low rumble in his throat, almost like an animal. “What do we look like from the outside now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“At the moment, one Rodian taxi driver reading a holozine while he's parked and waiting.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi could see out, but nobody could see in—or at least they could see something that wasn't actually in the taxi, thanks to the thin film of photoactive micro-emitters coating the interior. “Clever stuff, this gauze.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” Jusik said. “It took me a long time to work out how to program moving images into it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you bored?” Sev said, looking around at Fi. He still seemed wary of directing any of his comments at Jedi, even if all rank had been swept aside. “'Cos I'm not. And your constant yakking is getting to me somewhat, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik cut in. “Sorry, Sev. My fault.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev looked embarrassed for a moment. “If you're interested, fifty-one of the seventy crates I've clocked on this watch show up on the CSF database tagged as criminal. Theft is a bigger industry than legit business here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik raised an eyebrow. “Isn't that the sort of thing Obrim's people might like to know?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Isn't it the sort of stuff that would bring the boys in blue crashing in here and blowing our op?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Point taken.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No offense … Bardan.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta hadn't worked with Jedi much, at least not the junior ones. Fi savored a moment of delight at seeing Sev's stone-cold pretense reduced to embarrassed deference. All Jedi were supposed to be humble, but Jusik actually <em class="calibre6">was.</em> He seemed to see himself as nothing special, just a man with some accidental skills that didn't make him any more important than the next person, only <em class="calibre6">different.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">So they waited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And that was a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> harder than it looked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoa,” Sev said. “Look at this one …” Fi and Jusik followed the angle of Sev's scope. “CSF database has this tagged as RESTRICTED.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Could mean it's of interest to us, or could mean organized crime.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's visor had slipped to the end of his nose. “Or both.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a medium-sized delivery transport with dull green livery caked with dust. The identity transponder was evidently fake, because when the crate aligned itself with the platform at the doors to Warehouse 58, and the hatches sprang open, there were just a few boxes inside. The warehouse doors eased open far enough to let a repulsor cart edge out, and two droids began loading the small containers onto the repulsor's flatbed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Small but heavy load by the look of it,” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And we've got company.” Sev realigned the scope, and the datapad hummed into recording mode. “Second transport backing up to it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Another delivery vehicle hovered, edging astern until it was level with the other side of the landing platform. The boxes were transferred to it. They didn't go into the warehouse at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's irregular,” Sev said. “And we don't like irregular, do we? ID transponder says a legit rental vessel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">A female human in coveralls—white skin, wavy ginger hair to the shoulders, medium build, short—stepped out of the green transport onto the platform to be met by a male Falleen who'd jumped out of the rental. He was young, as far as Fi could tell, with light green skin, and his mundane pilot's rig was a little too long in the leg for him. All details were worth noting.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The two turned their backs to the skylane and appeared to be talking.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that's a rare sight, and I bet <em class="calibre6">he's</em> not on the CSF database,” Sev said, checking the 'pad. Images flicked across the screen at a blinding speed while the system sought a match from the image the scope had grabbed. After a few moments the screen read: NO MATCH. “Falleen don't venture offworld very often, and he certainly isn't here to check out the tourist sights. Let's try the woman.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi watched. There was a match indeed, and one that came up rapidly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Sev said. “Her name's Vinna Jiss. And she's a government employee.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not going to like this, am I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not when you hear she works in GAR logistics, no.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Chakaar,”</em> Fi said. “She could be on legit business, of course, but then I'm such a trusting soul.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Falleen male and GAR clerk? Hello? Do I have to draw you a picture?” Sev sighed to himself. “They certainly put those Falleen pheromones to good use. I bet she'd do him any favor he asked. Getting security information out of her would be even easier.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The two transports closed their hatches, leaving the woman and the Falleen on the platform, and lifted back into the skylane. It looked like any other delivery—except that it was a transfer of cargo, which was not usual, and the two waiting on the platform oozed <em class="calibre6">bad guys</em> from every pore and scale.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The two targets looked at their datapads just like warehouse staff checking a consignment. Then the Falleen turned and began walking up a pedestrian ramp to the retail level, and Vinna Jiss hung around.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm naturally curious,” Sev said. “Fi, you up for a discreet trail of those two?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's heart was pounding. Training and instinct took over. He was back on Kamino again, stalking an armed target in the simulated urban training terrain in Tipoca City. It was just the town that was simulated: the ammunition was real, <em class="calibre6">deadly</em> real. “Ready.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bardan, back up behind that pillar, will you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We can't abandon this position until the next watch arrives, Sev. Let me call for backup. What if they've pinged <em class="calibre6">us</em> and it's a decoy?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you let us out on foot, and call in Niner and Scorch to relieve you. Then you stand by via the comlink just in case.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's not standard operating procedure.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This isn't standard operating terrain, either.” Sev almost said <em class="calibre6">sir</em> Fi heard the beginning of a hissed <em class="calibre6">s.</em> Delta's self-appointed hard man poked his finger hard in his right ear as if he was afraid the bead-sized link would fall out. “There goes Jiss. Up the ramp, too. Come on, Fi. Move it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They slipped out of the taxi's twin hatches and activated Fi's holochart of the sector to check where the ramp led and where the exits were. They stared at the meshed blue and red lines on the holochart, courtesy of the fire department's database. Fi hoped it was up to date.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That takes them straight up to the retail plaza.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's immediate thoughts were of civilians, obstructed arcs of fire, and his own limited senses being a poor substitute for his Katarn helmet's gadgetry. <em class="calibre6">But I'm more than my armor. Sergeant Kal said so.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He edged along the wall, staying out of sight. <em class="calibre6">Can't deploy tracking remotes, not here, not in public.</em> “I might do a little shopping myself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just keep that dumb-grunt expression on your face, Mongrel Boy. It suits you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev took out his datapad and switched the screen to reflective mode, turning his back and holding the device a little out to his right. “She's just going over the top of the ramp … yeah, she's peeled off on the first level. She's following Lounge Lizard so far. Come on. Let's go around the bridge route and pick them up <em class="calibre6">here.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You have as bad an attitude toward ethnic diversity as you have toward the regular army,” Fi said quietly, relaxing his shoulders with every intention of just being a soldier on leave in his dark red fatigues—with a blaster on his belt, like any sensible Coruscanti.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The next hour was unplanned, unexpected, but not <em class="calibre6">untrained for.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi hoped he'd make it through alive.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Coruscant Security Force Staff and Social Club, 1300 hours, private booth, senior officers' bar</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Kal Skirata had his peripheral vision and half an ear trained on the general murmur at the bar. He felt bad about applying caution to these men: they had much the same thankless task as his boys. But there was a possibility that the leak was within their ranks. He couldn't let comradeship cloud his judgment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He hoped Obrim wasn't offended by the distortion field he'd set up. The little emitter sat discreetly on the table between the glasses like a rolled-up pellet of flimsi, ready to bounce any bugging signals.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If it's one of mine, I'll personally put a round through him,” Obrim said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't doubt it. “You could put a fake lure in the system and see who goes for it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But even if it's one of us, then they'd still need data from the GAR to complete the loop. It's one thing having the holo-cam images of military targets and movements. It's another knowing where they'll be to start with.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, then. I have to put someone inside GAR logistics.” There was only one choice: Ordo. “If we find a link to your people, though, I have to cut you loose. I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not exactly being kept in the loop on all this anyway, am I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I told you where my squads were operating, and they happened to get into a bit of trouble that attracted the attention of your people, you might have to call them off. Then everyone would know we had a strike team deployed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know. I'm just worried that your personnel will attract the attention of some of my overzealous colleagues, and one of us will be sending wreaths to next of kin.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My boys don't have next of kin. Only me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can't. I just can't. This has to be deniable.” He liked Obrim. He was a kindred spirit, a pragmatic man who didn't trust easily. “But if something looks like it's going to get out of hand, and I can warn you off, I will.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim swirled the dregs of his ale in the glass. “Okay. Sure you don't want one of these?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I only have one at night to help me sleep. Habit from Kamino. Sleep got pretty hard to come by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll have to tell me about that one day. I bet they didn't have any crime in Tipoca City.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh, there was crime, all right.” The worst kind: if he ever met another Kaminoan, he knew what he'd do. “Nothing you could have arrested anyone for, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When's your boy Fi going to stop by for a drink? We owe him one from the siege. Brave kid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah. He throws himself instinctively on a grenade, and he's a hero. If he fires instinctively and slots a civilian, though, he's a monster.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And don't <em class="calibre6">we</em> know it, pal. Happens to us, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anyway, Fi's on a routine patrol at the moment.” Skirata checked his chrono. Green Watch was due to relieve Red in two hours. “I'll bring him down here, don't worry. He's probably bored out of his skull at the moment. Anti-terror ops can be tedious.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sitting around, more sitting around, even more sitting around, then scramble, sheer panic, and <em class="calibre6">bang.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, I think that sums it up.” Skirata drained his glass of juice. “I just hope we get to the <em class="calibre6">bang</em> part in time.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Level 4 retail plaza, Quadrant B-85, Coruscant, 1310 hours; </strong><strong class="calibre11">Red Watch observing targets on foot</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">They should have called it in and let one of the other teams pick it up. But sometimes you had to run with it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was now on autopilot, reacting to training he hadn't realized he'd absorbed so thoroughly, and Sev was matching him pace for pace.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The shopping plaza was a mass of color, random people, and even more bewildering smells and sounds. This was life in the field without a helmet, and Fi didn't like it. Just ahead, Vinna Jiss wandered casually, moving along one diagonal line then another, and then pausing to stare into transparisteel windows full of things Fi had no idea that people bought—or wore.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev glanced at him. He didn't even have to say it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">She looks in an awful lot of shop windows. She doesn't follow a straight path. She thinks she knows how to avoid a tail, but she's learned it from the holovids. Amateur Weak link.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bardan … ,” Sev said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Jedi's voice was a whisper in Fi's ear. “I know where you are. Don't worry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not worried.” Sev glanced away from the target and Fi turned around casually toward her, looking past her but keeping her in his peripheral vision. “Can't see the Falleen now …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Moving on,” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They let Jiss walk on until she was almost lost in the crowd, and then started moving again. A well-planned surveillance operation would have positioned mobile and fixed teams in the area to simply watch and hand off the target to the next team along the route. But they were on their own. And they had never planned to follow a suspect.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is what Kal said we should <em class="calibre6">never</em> do,” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You got a better idea?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Reckon she's seen us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If she has, she hasn't reacted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why would she? If she's what we think she is, then we're just targets to <em class="calibre6">her”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The plaza was busy. There was a restaurant on the left-hand side with tables and chairs in the open air. Jiss sat down. Sev and Fi walked on past her, and if Fi looked like an overwhelmed clone who'd spent his life cloistered in military environments, then he wasn't acting. Even Qibbu's Hut felt more familiar than this.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wasn't the urban environment. It was the sheer mass of <em class="calibre6">civilians.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">They had no choice. They walked on farther.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Sev said. “She'll have doubled back or disappeared by the time we can turn around safely.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was looking straight ahead. He could see splashes of dark red between the multicolored shoulders of the dozens of species strolling around the plaza.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Here comes the Forty-first,” he said. “You can always rely on the infantry …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">A dozen or so brothers were ambling along, gazing around them and being gazed at by shoppers who had clearly never seen clones before. No matter how many times Fi saw that reaction, he always found himself wondering what they found so strange about it, and then had to see his own world as the rest of the galaxy saw it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Forty-first were level with them now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi smiled fraternally and got a bewildered nod or two in return. <em class="calibre6">They don't recognize me!</em> That felt strange. <em class="calibre6">All</em> his commando brothers knew him. And he could tell infantry from ship's crew by the way they walked. He walked between the men of the Forty-first with Sev like a marching band merging, and spun around at the back of the group to walk back toward the target.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was still sitting there. But she was looking the other way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was staring at another group of clone troopers heading toward her from the other direction.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I love being a familiar face,” Fi said. His anxiety gave way to a sense of heightened awareness, the thrill of the hunt. The woman's spine straightened as if she was going to jump up, but she sat tense for a few seconds until the clones drew level with her and met the group coming from the other direction. They stopped to chat. Fi and Sev melted into the group at the rear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm heading around the back of the plaza,” said Jusik's voice in their ears. “Niner's on station now. I'll give you some aerial recon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gotcha,” Fi said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">It's bad personal security to cluster like this.</em> But that didn't matter right then. The woman dithered, trying not to look at the group and failing miserably: Fi, like any clone, was exceptionally attuned to small gestures. Then she got up to walk briskly into the nearest shop.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe she owed Jango credits.” Fi shrugged and noted with a sinking heart that the shop looked to be exclusively for females. The garments on display were truly bizarre. “Or we're just not her type.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So, smart-mouth, you going to follow her in there?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I could.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What, tell them you're looking for a present for your girlfriend?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't push your luck. Is there a back way out?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev stepped into a doorway and shielded Fi while he took a quick look at the holochart and snapped off the image quickly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, but there's a landing platform for deliveries.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev dropped to a whisper. “Bardan, you with us yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's voice was almost a chuckle. “Fascinating,” he said. “I'm waiting at the delivery platform. A taxi is just what she needs right now.” Sev and Fi looked at each other. They could hear Jusik, but the taxi wasn't visible even when they stood back and glanced up discreetly at the roofline. Then they heard his voice, utterly level, utterly calm—utterly worrying. <em class="calibre6">“Yeah? Yeah, I am, lady … where d'you want to go? I've got a booking, but …”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sev, tell me he isn't doing what I think he is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's doing it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's nuts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev lowered his voice to a whisper in the comlink. “Bardan, if we lift her now, we'll blow this op. Don't overplay it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Okay, lady, but the spaceport isn't my regular run, so that'll be extra.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was the sound of someone getting into the taxi and a woman's voice. <em class="calibre6">“Yes, just drop me off at the domestic terminal, please.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi wondered for a moment if ordinary people had shared thoughts like the one he knew Sev was sharing with him. They'd been trained to think the same way, the soldier's way. Where was Jusik going with this? If he dropped her off like a normal taxi, they'd lose her in the terminal anyway. He couldn't follow her in there and check where she went without blowing his cover. And if he <em class="calibre6">didn't</em> drop her off …</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev was staring past Fi. “Lizard on your six,” he said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi turned very, very slowly and stopped when he caught the Falleen male in his peripheral vision at the point where the plaza funneled into a spiral ramp down to another level. He was searching. So the woman hadn't caught up with him when he expected, and he was looking for her. And that meant she had no comlink, or she'd have used it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now <em class="calibre6">he's</em> going to be bad news. He's carrying some serious cannon. Look at the line of his jacket.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's voice was a quiet descant to Fi's pulse pounding in his head. <em class="calibre6">“Oh, fierfek. That's great. Being rerouted again … this is going to cost, lady … another detour …”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's way too smart for his own good.” Sev looked exasperated. “Bardan, are you doing what I think you're doing? Are you heading back our way?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“I pay good license money not to have to use automated lanes,”</em> said Jusik's voice in their ears. He really didn't sound at all like a nice Jedi Temple boy now. <em class="calibre6">And then I still get diverted. What do we pay our taxes for?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll take that as a yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Falleen moved off, pausing occasionally to look around, and ambled slowly down the ramp. Fi and Sev leaned on the edge of the parapet like any tourist might to take in the view below.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi dropped his voice. “He's calling someone.” The Falleen had the back of his hand raised to his mouth. <em class="calibre6">Oh, for a helmet comlink.</em> Fi might have been able to pick up the frequency. “Is it her? Or backup?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We could call this in and get Niner and Scorch to pick him up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And then we drag another team off station. No, let's see this through.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev sat down on a bench, looking suitably disoriented. “Bardan, where are you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Let me try this shortcut, lady … hey, who you calling? You making a complaint about fares already?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I bet she's calling Lounge Lizard. Great.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, and now that our driver's got a very dodgy passenger, has he thought what we're going to do with her?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Same as we did with Orjul and the Nikto,” Sev said, getting up to walk across to the taxi platform at the end of the plaza. They had to get in fast when Jusik appeared and opened that hatch. Fi had visions of the potential grief that would be unleashed if a passenger was screaming her head off when the taxi hatch opened in a very public place.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Land at ninety degrees, Bardan. Sev will access via the port hatch and I'll go in the other, and we'll pin her down.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, I think Fi can manage to subdue a civilian,” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remind me to show you my unfunny side later, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Skirata's going to kill us for this—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Better get it right then,” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Here he comes …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Steady, Bardan.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Too fast.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's a Jedi. There's no such thing as too fast.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The battered taxi, its anti-surveillance gauze now showing a human driver that wasn't Jusik, dropped onto the platform scattering dust and grit. The two commandos ran to their respective sides.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's voice filled their heads now. <em class="calibre6">“Hatches in three … two … one!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">They threw themselves in. The hatches snapped shut so fast that Fi felt his pant leg snag in the seal but he was flat on top of a squealing, struggling woman and then she went quiet because Sev clamped his hand over her mouth.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You waiting for a tip?” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The taxi lifted in a straight vertical and nearly shaved the paintwork off another cab trying to drop off passengers. It was just as well that Enacca had done something creative about the identity transponder.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, I don't suppose you brought any restraints?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, but this usually works.” Fi freed his right arm and put his blaster to Jiss's head. “Ma'am, shut up and stop struggling. I have no problem shooting women.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">No, he didn't. Enemies were enemies. Females were soldiers, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik took the taxi high into what appeared to be a commuter lane and shot off in a complex loop that first took them away from Qibbu's and relative safety, and then dropped down between lanes where the layers of traffic overhead gave some protection against visual surveillance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've been tagged,” Jusik said. He shut his eyes, far too long for Fi's comfort. It was the first time he'd seen the Jedi fly with his eyes closed, and the fact that the good ones could do that didn't reassure the simple animal part of him that said it shouldn't be possible. “Yes, we're being followed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi wanted to ask how he knew but Jiss had no reason to know Jusik was a Jedi, and the less she knew, the easier it would be to <em class="calibre6">process</em> her, as Skirata put it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can evade them, right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“About as well as anyone can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Any idea who they are?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“None, other than they're very persistent, and if it's CSF, it's an unmarked vessel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can sense all that information?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He opened his eyes again. “Yes, because they're only two or three speeders behind us and I can see them in the mirror.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev looked at Fi with the unspoken count of <em class="calibre6">one, two, three.</em> Sev released his grip on Jiss as Fi clamped his arm tight around her neck, blaster pressed so hard into her temple that the muzzle was ringed with a little patch of white bloodless skin. He could feel her heart pounding through her back against his chest even through the thin sheet of body armor under his tunic. He wondered for a moment if it was his own frantic heartbeat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev reached under the rear seat for his DC-17 and took out the grenade attachment. “Okay, it lacks finesse, but we're late for lunch. And if they track us, we're finished.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Here? In daylight, in traffic?” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not yet.” Sev tried to aim his Deece and snapped on the grenade launcher. “Open the rear screen a crack. Can you hold steady?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You wanted me to outrun them—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can't. We've got to drop them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik looked in the rearview. “In a <em class="calibre6">skylane?</em> You haven't got a clear shot and the debris will—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me sniper, you pilot. Understand the difference?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's grip on the steering vane tightened. “Too many vessels and too much debris. Let's head for somewhere less crowded.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe Qiilura?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Hold on <em class="calibre6">tight.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik dropped the taxi like a stone and plummeted ten, then fifteen, then twenty levels to the lower skylanes, slipping in between two transports and then jumping between horizontal lanes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Still there,” said Sev. “Three vehicles behind.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Have they alerted anyone?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can't sense anything.” Jusik kept shaking his head as if trying to clear it. “They might not want to risk using comlinks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Who the fierfek are they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't know! I'm not a mind-reader and if you'd just <em class="calibre6">shut up</em> because I'm trying to concentrate on flying and listening and—” His voice trailed off. “Just <em class="calibre6">aim.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi pressed his blaster harder into the woman's head. She flinched and shut her eyes tight. He could feel no emotion whatsoever, just the cold clarity of his life and his comrades' against her existence, and it seemed an easy equation.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Move and you're dead, ma'am, okay?” <em class="calibre6">Move?</em> Even Fi wasn't sure he could make an escape from a speeder moving this fast and this erratically—and not at this height, either. “Start thinking of all the helpful information you're going to give us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik broke from the automated lane and fell another five levels like a stone, drawing screaming protests of klaxons as he skimmed other vessels. But the speeder dropped with them, delayed only by a few seconds. Then he banked right into a service vessel tunnel, and Fi had no idea where they were. It was enclosed. And that was <em class="calibre6">bad</em>. Fi wasn't a pilot but flying fast down a tube struck him as suicide.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, I know where I'm heading,” Jusik said, as if he were suddenly telepathic. Fi wondered if he had protested aloud and hadn't realized. “I <em class="calibre6">know</em>. And they can't get a signal through down here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then he fell silent. And this was where it became very, very frightening to have a Jedi on the squad, because Jusik had shifted from a skill that Fi could see to something beyond his comprehension.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik was now skimming a meter above the surface of a conduit lit at regular intervals by a dim green light. Sev was struggling to get a steady shot through the narrow opening in the rear screen. All Fi could do was watch one madman or the other while he held a gun to a woman's head, and Fi didn't enjoy not being in control of his environment. He thought of Sicko again and the moment when he and Omega were helpless and utterly dependent on that pilot's skill. <em class="calibre6">Poor Sicko.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sev, he's twenty meters behind us, right?” said Jusik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Spot on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you going to be ready when I say fire?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Try me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only on my mark.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get on with it, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi felt his left arm going numb around the woman's neck, and he struggled to keep the blaster hard against her head. The taxi was veering from side to side. “I just hope they're not CSF.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're not <em class="calibre6">ours … ,”</em> Sev said. “And they're in pursuit. So they're a <em class="calibre6">target.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi dug the blaster into the woman's skin. “Are they your people, ma'am?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't know! <em class="calibre6">I don't know!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“If they are, it's too bad,” Sev said. “We can't let them track us back.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik speeded up. “Stand by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi noticed that he had his eyes shut again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fire!” Jusik said, and the taxi suddenly flipped up ninety degrees and climbed in an agonizing vertical. Fi braced for impact.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had to be dead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But the taxi was still climbing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They were in a vertical shaft and a ball of blue-white flame roared beneath them. Fi was thrown against Sev but he locked his arm tight around the woman's neck, and all three of them hit the partly open rear screen as the sound of ricocheting debris faded behind them in the service duct.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The light dimmed fast beneath them and suddenly disappeared as Jusik slammed the taxi into another right angle and they were flying horizontally along a channel again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Target down.” Sev shut his eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That better <em class="calibre6">not</em> be CSF,” Fi said. “That's going to be very messy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Suddenly they were bathed in hazy sunlight. Jusik brought them out into passenger traffic and slipped into the automated lanes of private speeders again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What do we look like from the outside now?” Sev asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik wiped his forehead with his palm and looked as breathless and battered as he ever had after performing the <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda.</em> Fi could have sworn he looked just as elated, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Family of Garqian tourists with a Gran driver,” the Jedi said. “Now let's try to explain this to you-know-who without getting our heads ripped off.” He opened his comlink. “Returning with a prisoner, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev grumbled in his throat. <em class="calibre6">“Never</em> use real names.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Least of our worries now,” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So Jusik was scared of Skirata, too. It was supposed to be a quiet <em class="calibre6">ohs job, as</em> he'd put it, observation duty; it had turned into kidnapping and blowing up unidentified vessels. <em class="calibre6">Scared</em> wasn't the right word, though.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">He'll be</em> disappointed <em class="calibre6">with us. We let him down.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi, like anyone who came into Skirata's circle, desperately wanted <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> to be proud of him. It was more effective motivation than fear any day.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remember he even shoves Wookiees around,” said Fi. He adjusted his grip on the woman's neck to stop the tingling in his fingers. “And they take it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The taxi was silent except for the occasional whimpering gulp from Jiss and the rumble of the vessel's hard-pressed drive. Eventually Jusik came to a shuddering halt on the platform at the top level of Qibbu's Hut. Sev called on his comlink for a hand with the woman, and Atin came running out with Fixer.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What have you been playing at? Skirata's going nuts in there.” Atin slid into the taxi and put cuffs on Jiss. “Get out and we'll take her to the safe house. You've got some explaining to do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Safe house</em> for them, maybe. Safe for her? No. But then she had picked the wrong side. She wasn't a helpless victim.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">So much for whining that we never get to see the enemy.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The taxi lifted off, leaving Fi, Sev, and Jusik standing on the platform, exhausted by adrenaline.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you for flying Jedi Air.” Jusik grinned, and shook their hands. “Have a nice afternoon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're all insane,” said Sev, and stalked off.</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_15" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36416550" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36416551" class="calibre8"></a>12 <br class="calibre9"/>

But</em> someone's <em class="calibre6">going to notice you blew up their people. And so is CSE. What do you want me to tell them?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–Captain Jailer Obrim, to Kal Skirata</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 1600 hours, 380 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“You're <em class="calibre6">sure</em> nobody followed you?” Skirata said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strike team, minus. Ordo, was assembled in the main room, sitting where they could. For a moment Skirata was distracted by the way Darman and Etain were positioned. It told him something, but he had more pressing issues right now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd calmed down, too. Red Watch was back safely. Jusik, predictably, was taking his roasting like a man.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sure, Kal. I <em class="calibre6">felt</em> it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't go mystic on me. Did you go through the procedures? Give me tangibles.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I didn't return via a direct route. I looped back on myself several times. <em class="calibre6">Nothing.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no point yelling at them. Skirata knew he probably would have done the same. It was all very well to talk about painstaking surveillance and meticulous planning before resolving a threat, but when a truly ripe target walked in front of your scope—no, he <em class="calibre6">would</em> have done the same.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he was simply relieved that they'd made it back in one piece.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, surveillance is off for the day. We change vehicles again, and we'll start defense watches, just in case the Force has deceived <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> and we've got a load of bad guys on our case now. Enacca is identifying a second location we can pull back to if this place is compromised.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik looked crushed. “I'm sorry, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You weren't in command. I should have made sure you were ready for this.” Skirata turned to Fi and Sev. Fi looked crestfallen; Sev was complete blank insolence. “And what have you two got to say for yourselves?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It won't happen again, Kal.” Fi looked at Jusik. “And it was me and Sev who decided to go for it. If Bardan hadn't done some clever flying, we'd all be dead now and the op would be over.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you, Sev?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev turned his head with slow deliberation. “What he said.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Son, I know you <em class="calibre6">think</em> you're a hard case because you survived Walon Vau, and you probably <em class="calibre6">are.</em> But anti-terrorist ops are more about <em class="calibre6">this.”</em> Skirata walked over to him and rapped his head so hard with his knuckles that the <em class="calibre6">thunk</em> of bone was audible. Sev blinked but didn't move a muscle. “If you'd thought about it for two minutes, you could have relayed that identification back here and we could have planned some intelligent surveillance. But now we've got <em class="calibre6">another</em> prisoner plus a bunch of dead guys, and we have to explain why a GAR employee isn't going back to the office anytime soon. Because if she wasn't working alone, then some <em class="calibre6">di'kut</em> is going to notice she's absent. Have I missed anything?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner, arms folded, looked up. “Yes, who's helping Vau now? He must have his hands full.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Enacca. Wookiees are good at looking like a crowd.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss had been remarkably quiet for the last ten days. He'd worked his watches without complaint and had shown none of the swaggering confidence that the Delta boys were known for. Now he was pacing up and down the length of the window, slow and deliberate, and glancing occasionally at Niner. Skirata wondered if it was the displacement from the sergeant role that was getting to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Might as well lance the boil.</em> “You want to say something, Boss?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“With respect, Kal, we have different approaches, don't we?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Spit it out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta does rapid <em class="calibre6">neutralization.</em> Omega does the more <em class="calibre6">considered</em> stuff. Why not split our tasking that way?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">For once, rock-solid Niner took the bait. “Yeah, you blow up everything without checking and we think first. I certainly agree with your analysis, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“And we have the unbroken track record of successful missions.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like we don't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You said it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata wasn't quite fast enough crossing the room and Niner had slammed Boss hard against the wall without a moment's warning. If Skirata hadn't yelled “Check!” Niner would have smashed his drawn-back fist into Boss's face. The two men stood almost nose-to-nose, locked in a frozen standoff.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This stops right <em class="calibre6">now,”</em> Skirata barked. “You hear me? Stand <em class="calibre6">down!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd never seen Niner react like that. Soldiers got into scraps all the time; it was an inevitable part of being encouraged to fight. Sometimes they took a swing at each other, but it was rarely serious, no more than a bit of bravado. But not his boys—and certainly not Niner.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a switch in all men somewhere, no matter how deeply buried, that could be thrown.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You have <em class="calibre6">never</em> lost brothers.” Niner took one grudging step back from Boss. <em class="calibre6">“Never.</em> You have no idea.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ever wondered why?” said Boss.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Enough.” Skirata put an arm between them. “Next one to open his mouth gets a thump from <em class="calibre6">me,</em> okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">This was the brief moment where the fight would erupt or vanish, and Skirata was secretly uncertain if he had what it took to separate two bigger, younger, fitter men. But Niner muttered, “Yes, Sarge,” and sat down in a chair on the far side of the room, face white with anger. Boss paused, then followed him to hold out a placatory hand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Apologies, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner just looked up at him, unblinking. Then he took Boss's hand and shook it, but his mind was clearly elsewhere, and Skirata knew <em class="calibre6">exactly</em> where. Some things didn't go away with time. Niner had lost another Sev, plus DD and O-Four, at Geonosis; and during training he'd lost Two-Eight. Republic Commandos never forgot the brothers they grew up with in that tight pod from the time they were decanted.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Delta still had their pod intact. The world was different for them. They thought they were invincible; death only happened to others.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think we need to take a step back,” Skirata said, bleeding for Niner. He'd thought the squad was as close as a true pod, but they still nursed their loss. “Delta, you break off and get a meal downstairs and report back at nineteen-hundred. Omega, you break when they get back. Maybe we'll all feel better on a full stomach.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no point turning this into a contest between the squads. But mixing them hadn't helped that much. Skirata watched Delta troop out toward the turbolift. It was going to take more than food to distract them, although it usually did the trick.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are we all okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin looked up from a datapad he was cannibalizing. Dismantling things seemed to keep him happy. “We're okay, Sarge. Sorry. I just don't feel happy calling you <em class="calibre6">Kal.</em> Except in public, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's okay, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata made a point of sitting down where he could see Darman and make a discreet assessment. There was something about the way he was turned slightly toward Etain in his seat, and she made a lot more eye contact with him than she had earlier. Skirata wondered why he hadn't spotted it earlier, and also when it had happened.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If he was right …</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was bad for discipline to let an officer and an enlisted man have a relationship. But Etain wasn't an officer, and Darman had never chosen to enlist. The risk lay more in how Darman would handle it, and how left behind his brothers might feel now that they were out in a world where everyone who wasn't wearing armor was free to love.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood up and limped across to Etain. “Come and explain some Jedi stuff to me,” he said quietly. “I'd ask <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika,</em> but he's still in disgrace at the moment.” He winked at Jusik to indicate he was joking: the kid took his ribbing far too seriously sometimes. “Outside.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wasn't subtle, but Darman obviously didn't think anyone else had noticed what was going on between them. He probably thought Skirata wanted to discuss the unsavory side of interrogation with her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sat down next to Etain on the rickety bench against the landing platform wall. It was late afternoon and the air smelled of hot speeder drives and the powdery sweet scent of a solitary mayla vine that had taken root in a crack in the permacrete. Etain folded her hands in the lap of her pale blue tunic. Without the dull brown robes she didn't look like a Jedi at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You and Darman,” Skirata said carefully.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She closed her eyes for a second. “He told you, then. I suppose he tells you everything.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not a word. But I'm not stupid.” It was amazing how easily people told you things when you didn't even ask a question. Perhaps she actually wanted people to know. But it seemed Darman didn't, and he had a right to keep what little privacy he had. “I heard the squad's comments after Qiilura.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you telling me to stop?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I'm asking where this is heading.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you going to tell <em class="calibre6">him</em> to stop?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not if you make him happy.” Skirata trod carefully, but he knew where he drew the line and whose interests he would put first, war or not. “See, I know that much about Jedi. You can't <em class="calibre6">love.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're not <em class="calibre6">supposed</em> to. But we sometimes do. <em class="calibre6">I</em> do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're serious about him, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I never stopped thinking about him after Qiilura.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Have you <em class="calibre6">really</em> worked this out?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That I'll outlive him? Women outlive their men all the time. That I might be thrown out of the Jedi Order? As prices go, that's worth paying.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Etain, he's more vulnerable than you think. He's a grown man and he's a killing machine, but he's a kid, too. Crying over girlfriends can be dangerously distracting for him and the whole squad.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd hate to see him used. If you're going to carry on with this, you'd better mean it.” He paused to make sure she understood what he was saying. “You know I'll protect him come what may, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain's lips parted slightly and her cheeks looked suddenly pink. Her gaze flickered slightly. “I want him to be happy, Kal. I'd never use him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm glad we agree,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Threatening a Jedi general was probably a court-martial offense. Skirata didn't care. Darman and his last remaining sons came before everything, before the needs of a likable young Jedi, before even his own life—and certainly before the interests of the Republic's politics.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a matter of honor, and love.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Etain would give Darman a little comfort and tenderness in his life that would tide him through the dark and inevitable days ahead, days that for him and his brothers were already destined to be limited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata would just have to keep an eye on the situation. “Make him happy, then, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika,”</em> he said. “Just make him <em class="calibre6">happy.”</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">* * *</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo slipped among the motley assortment of drinkers and gamblers, now diluted considerably by a sea of dark red GAR fatigues, and hoped none of the species here were scent-followers. That was the trouble with some explosives. They had a distinctive smell. He'd scrubbed himself as thoroughly as he could and changed into the ubiquitous red fatigues as well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Laseema, the Twi'lek female who had fled from the kitchens when he found her cowering behind a table, smiled nervously at him across the bar. By the time he reached it, she had his favorite muja juice waiting for him without the prompt of his distinctive armor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How do you know I'm me?” he said, puzzled. “I could be any clone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The way you hold yourself.” She had a very soft voice, and he had to strain to hear her in the noisy bar. “You stand as if you're still wearing that skirt.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kama,”</em> he said patiently. “Belt-spat. It's based on a traditional Mandalorian hunting <em class="calibre6">kama.</em> It was designed to protect your legs.” Yes, the pauldron and <em class="calibre6">kama</em> did tend to make him stand more upright out of habit, his back a little arched. He'd have to watch that if he wanted to pass for an ordinary clone trooper. “But it's just for show now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah,” she said. “It's certainly very showy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was getting used to the attention of Twi'lek females, and he rather liked it. “Is Qibbu treating you properly?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. Thank you.” Laseema sounded as if she really was grateful. She leaned forward a little. He was still taken aback by the vivid blue of her skin, but he was willing to get used to it. She had a little scar on the point of her chin that was turquoise and more decorative than disfiguring. “Is your friend a captain?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She glanced sideways and Ordo followed her gaze to Omega Squad and Skirata, who were eating something unidentifiable and occasionally lifting a lump of it on a fork to inspect it communally with worried frowns. “The one with the scar. He's nice.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's Atin,” Ordo said, crushed. <em class="calibre6">Oh.</em> “He's … not a captain. He's a private.” The vast majority of the army was made up of privates: it wasn't restricted information. Atin glanced up with that unerring soldier's sense of knowing when someone was targeting you. He managed a shy smile. “Yes, he's very reliable.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's got a lot of scars. Has he been in many battles?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Oh, she really <em class="calibre6">had</em> been studying Atin carefully: apart from the thin diagonal scar across his face, the rest were harder to spot, just a couple on his hands and one telltale line that was visible above the neckline of his red tunic.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes,” Ordo said. “They've all been in quite a few battles.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Poor Atin,” she said, looking smitten. “I'll bring your meal over in a moment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He forced a smile as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> had taught him, picked up his glass, and went to join Omega's table.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What d'you reckon <em class="calibre6">this</em> is, Ordo?” Darman said. He held his fork so that Ordo could inspect the object skewered on it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A <em class="calibre6">tube</em> of some sort.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's what we were afraid of.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's all protein.” Ordo stared at Atin. “Laseema has taken a fancy to you, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no jeering or barracking as Ordo had seen ordinary males do at the mention of females. The squad simply sat in silence for a moment and then resumed their debate on the anatomical content of Qibbu's dish of the day. Skirata got up and moved along the bench to sit next to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Successful <em class="calibre6">shopping</em> trip?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have everything on the list now. Sorry for the delay. And I have a few extras.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How extra?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Surprising</em> extras. Very noisy, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Laseema glided up to the table and placed a dish in front of Ordo. She smiled at Atin before making her way back to the bar. Ordo picked up his fork to eat, and the squad studied his plate intently.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But that's all <em class="calibre6">vegetables,”</em> Niner said accusingly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course it is,” Ordo said. “My intelligence score is at least thirty-five percent higher than yours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It happened to be true. Skirata laughed. Ordo cleared his plate as fast as he could and then indicated the turbolift. Skirata followed him up to their rooms, where Delta Squad sat cleaning their DC-17s.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just <em class="calibre6">dusting,”</em> Fixer said, subtle as a bantha.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dust away,” Skirata said. “They'll see action soon enough. So, Ordo, what did you get?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A hundred kilos of thermal plastoid plus five thousand detonators.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even Scorch looked up from his dismantled rifle at the mention of <em class="calibre6">that.</em> “That's a lot of ordnance to make disappear without anyone noticing, let alone store it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I liberated it in stages from different sources.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata tapped him on the arm. “Now explain the extra surprise.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The delay was because I enriched it all—minus a pack or two.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A little chemical refinement that'll make it unstable if anyone attempts to use it in devices.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How unstable, exactly?” Skirata asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If they don't work a stabilizer compound into the plastoid, it'll blow their workshop into orbit as soon as they attach a det to it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch sniggered appreciatively.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just a precaution,” Ordo said. “If we end up using it for a sting operation and by some chance it goes wrong, then we'll at least remove a few <em class="calibre6">huruune</em> in the process.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And half of Galactic City.” Sev grunted to himself and peered through his scope to calibrate it against the view from the window. “You spook boys overdo it sometimes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata patted Ordo's arm. “Nice job, son. Now tell me where you've stored it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Half at the safe house and half under Fixer's bed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch guffawed. Boss smacked his ear but it didn't stop him from laughing. “I'm sharing Fixer's room, <em class="calibre6">di'kut.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, you won't even wake up if <em class="calibre6">that</em> blows.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo accepted it was a risk, but risks were relative. And Skirata hadn't expressed interest at his advanced ordnance skills, so he could still keep Mereel's return as a surprise.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was going to be pleased with Mereel's news on Ko Sai, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So all we have to do now is work out how we get them to take the bait,” said Skirata. “Maybe Vau is getting somewhere with our GAR colleague.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss looked up. “You more interested in using the stuff to kill them, track them, or make them think everything's going fine on the terror front?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll take all three.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does it usually take this long to get anywhere?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata laughed. <em class="calibre6">“Long?</em> Son, it normally takes <em class="calibre6">years</em> to shut down a network. This is lightning speed. It might still take years, and it's just a fraction of the trouble out there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Makes you wonder why we bother.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because we can't <em class="calibre6">not</em> bother,” Skirata said. “And because it's for <em class="calibre6">us.”</em> He sat back in the chair in the corner and put his boots up on the low table, shutting his eyes and folding his arms on his chest. “Vau's calling in shortly. If I don't hear the comlink, somebody wake me up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had rarely known Skirata to sleep before his men did. And he had seldom seen him use a bed. He always slept in a chair if he had the choice, and while it might have been a mercenary's need to be ready to wake and fight immediately, Ordo suspected it had a lot to do with that first night on Kamino. His normal life had ceased, and would remain suspended until that elusive normality had been achieved for his troops. He always seemed to be waiting for the Kaminoans to come through the door.</div>

<div class="paragraph">His breathing changed to the shallow, slow rhythm of a man asleep.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch started whistling, distracted by his task. Ordo walked up behind him and clamped his hand hard over his mouth. <em class="calibre6">Quiet. Quiet for</em> Kal'buir.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch took the hint.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo waited, memorizing Mereel's download from his datapad with a single glance at each screen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Skirata's wrist comlink chirped. He opened his eyes and lifted his hand nearer his mouth.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Walon …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Try Jailer,” a weary voice said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sat bolt upright. Delta Squad froze.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where are you?” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sweeping up a pile of dead guys with colleagues from the Organized Crime Unit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think your boys just kicked off a gang war. Can I borrow a Jedi, please?”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“There's your lizard,” Obrim said, pulling back the sheet. “Paxaz Izhiq.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi and Skirata looked at the elegant green-scaled face, or at least the half that was still intact. Blasterfire was cleaner than ballistic damage but it still did nothing for your looks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not very attractive to the ladies now, is he?” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The morgue was cool and quiet. Fi had never seen one before and he was both fascinated and disturbed, not because it was full of dead things but because he now wondered what would happen to his own body.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Left on a battlefield. Does it matter? Mandalorians don't care about remains. We have our soul. My brothers can retrieve some of my armor, and that'll be enough.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The pale green room with its polished durasteel doors also had an antiseptic smell that reminded him of Kamino. He wasn't comfortable here.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You okay?” Obrim said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just interested.” Fi stared. “Yes, that's him. You can match him with the images Sev grabbed, too. Is he important?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not on our files, but Falleen don't visit Coruscant to get nice jobs in the clerical service. Best guess is Black Sun or an offshoot.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So,” Skirata said. “Purely <em class="calibre6">hypothetically,</em> if we picked up a woman friend of his who had access to GAR weapons shipments …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Purely hypothetically, because <em class="calibre6">you don't exist …</em> imagine she's diverting a few weapons for his business, but you snatch her and so he refuses to complete the deal because he thinks you're the customer trying to intimidate him.” Fi listened, riveted. Obrim's mental gymnastics were hard to follow. “But the real customer thinks the Falleen just made an excuse to run out on their agreement. So they come after you, thinking you're his foot soldiers. And you waste them. So their buddies come back to settle a few scores with young Scale-Face's colleagues.” Obrim took one final look at the Falleen's face and covered it up again. “And if they were all waiting on a shipment of explosives anyway—the one you intercepted—then you have a <em class="calibre6">very</em> jumpy assortment of bad guys around town.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're going to have to spell out why this is good news,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, we're minus some criminal scum, and we've found more we didn't even know about. Plus we now have some good forensics. The SOCO team has been all over his apartment like a rash.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Solid gold for the Organized Crime Unit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoopee for them, but was he or was he not <em class="calibre6">handling explosives?”</em> Skirata was getting agitated, chewing that ruik root again. “I'm not interested in gangsters stealing Republic weapons for their own purposes. Is his gang supplying explosives to anyone?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, we found traces everywhere. Your Jedi colleagues seem to be finding the disturbance in the Force useful—whatever <em class="calibre6">that</em> means.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does this mean that your Organized Crime Unit is going to be getting in our way now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Share operational details with me and they won't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know the rules of this game.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, your boys are coming awfully close to being targeted by CSF themselves. It could easily have been you and them in a shooting match. I don't want any friendly-fire incidents if we can avoid them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi watched Kal’s jaw muscles working as he chewed. This wasn't warfare. It had crossed over into armed politics. Skirata and Obrim seemed to be conducting a private war by their own rules, and Fi didn't envy them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know that we're not taking prisoners,” Skirata said. “And I can't see your people turning a blind eye to that once they know what we're up to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But I've got something you need,” Obrim said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata switched instantly from lovable rogue to a creature of pure ice. “Don't ever, <em class="calibre6">ever</em> try to bargain with me about <em class="calibre6">this.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are we on the same side or not?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was ashen. “We'll go it alone then.” Fi had rarely seen him truly angry, but when he had been pushed too far he went white and quiet and <em class="calibre6">dangerous.</em> “Come on, son. We've got work to do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He took Fi's elbow and steered him to the doors. It didn't bode well. Fi looked back over his shoulder at Obrim—a man equally white, equally tense—and the captain shook his head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, Kal, I'll give it to you anyway, but may the Force save your sorry backside if this goes wrong.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata turned. He seemed genuinely surprised: he hadn't been bluffing. He really <em class="calibre6">had</em> been storming off and cutting Obrim out of the loop. “What happens if it does go wrong, Jailer? You get into trouble with your bosses. But my boys <em class="calibre6">die.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, and so might mine if they get in the way by accident.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then don't get in the way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, what time did your people grab the woman?” Obrim asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Midafternoon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, there was someone trying to get hold of our irresistible friend here via a government comlink shortly before CSF went to his home an hour ago.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You mean there's someone else in the GAR working with him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, and if we could pin down the transmission source, I'd have given it to you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's shoulders sagged. “Thank you, my friend.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't mention it. Just try to give me a warning before you start another war here, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That was a nice smokescreen line to the media, by the way. Gang war indeed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's very nearly true. But thank your oily friend Mar Rugeyan for that. You'll owe him one, I'm sure.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata rolled his eyes. Fi continued to be surprised by the machinations of political life in Coruscant. He was grateful—and not for the first time—that all he had to do was shoot or be shot. There was no time to worry or plan: either you did a better, faster job than the enemy at that particular moment or you died.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Rugeyan wants good news,” Skirata said. “Let's see if we can find some for him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim smiled ruefully at Fi and made a gesture of tipping back a glass of ale. “Don't forget that drink, will you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They left Obrim in the morgue and took the service turbolift to disappear into the late-night crowds around the CSF complex and emerge at a taxi platform to wait for Jusik to collect them. Skirata simply glanced at three innocent Coruscanti citizens waiting there, too, and they decided they had urgent business elsewhere. <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> could look anything but paternal when he felt like it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi pulled his collar up, still feeling horribly exposed without his armor. Skirata rummaged in his pocket, took out a bar of candied fruit, and broke it in two. He handed Fi the bigger piece.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What now?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's the only solid lead we've got,” Skirata said. “And it's a mess, but I'm reluctant to let it go and start over.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I bet the Seps are looking for another source of supply for their explosives now. If this were Qiilura or any other mining planet, they could do it easily. On an urban world like this … well, scoring a few blasters is easy, but shopping for explosives is going to attract attention. Maybe this is where we use Ordo's little cache of stuff that goes bang.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stopped chewing. “I'm never sure if we have the same ideas because they're common sense, or because I trained you and now you're as crazy as I am, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, they know their original consignment didn't arrive, so now you might as well use the stuff as bait.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And there's Qibbu.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now, <em class="calibre6">that</em>'s dangerous.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, that's when Hutts come in <em class="calibre6">useful.</em> They're like one big scum want-ad service. Seeing as he thinks we're doing a bit of private business without the GAR'S consent anyway, why disappoint him? He can put the word out that Kal has something to sell.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But then we've pinpointed our operational base for them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You think Qibbu will want to advertise that we're in his precious hotel, with the possibility of unpleasantness and lots of damage following him home, too? He won't discuss locations. He likes being alive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you're going to tell Obrim, right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Only the location when we have a delivery set up with our new customers,” Skirata said. “And then only to warn off CSF.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He lapsed into silence. Around them—keeping a sensible distance, because Skirata looked remarkably gangsterish himself right then—ordinary citizens and tourists from dozens of species were making their way in and out of brightly lit clubs, restaurants, and shops. They were dressed in exotic, colorful clothes, chattering and enjoying themselves: they were arm in arm with friends, or holding hands with lovers, or accompanied by gaping children who had never seen a city-planet like this at night.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi knew how those kids felt. It was still as much a spectacle of miraculous delight to him as it had been when he first saw it from the crew bay of a police cruiser. But it was also now something alien to him, something he had no stake in and could never fully understand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The civilians around him could have no idea of what was happening right in the middle of their safe daily lives. A few meters from them, a mercenary and a soldier who had no official orders were planning to unload enough explosives on the black market to destroy whole quadrants.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But it was a fair trade. Because Fi had no idea of what their lives were about, either.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">We live in parallel worlds. We can see each other, but we never meet.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">At least Darman seemed to have found a bridge to a normal life, if you could call a Jedi normal. Fi wondered if his brother realized that everyone knew what was going on with him and the general.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If he were Darman, he wouldn't care.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 0056 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">381 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Ordo placed the tight-wrapped packs of five-hundred grade thermal plastoid explosive on the table and stacked them in piles of ten. Darman picked one up and fondled it with the fascinated expression of a connoisseur of explosives.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was interesting, Etain thought, to note what made Darman feel relaxed and confident, because sitting on fifty kilos of ultrahigh explosives didn't reassure her at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dar, cut it out,” Niner said. “We'd like the hotel to still be here when Vau arrives. Reckon you can avoid blowing the place up for the next hour?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This stuff is perfectly safe unless you stick something metallic in it and trigger an electrolytic reaction,” Darman said. He smiled at Etain before lobbing a hand-sized pack at Niner. <em class="calibre6">“Udesii, ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner caught it and swore. Then he threw it back.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain could hear the shower running in the 'fresher. She could also see Atin wandering around, eyes fixed in defocus on the grubby carpet as if he was rehearsing a speech in his head, and he was trailing a disturbance in the Force that felt like the aftermath of a battle. She'd felt Atin's raw grief on Qiilura, the pain at losing his original brothers at Geonosis, and she could taste the dark depths in him all too easily.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi, even without the ability to use the Force, seemed to be able to do the same. From time to time he got up and gripped his brother by his upper arm, talking very quietly and earnestly to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Much of the conversation was in Mandalorian, which she didn't understand well enough, but she certainly picked up one word that needed no translation: <em class="calibre6">Vau.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss, Jusik, and Scorch had gone back down to the bar. Sev and Fixer were out on the landing platform—now looking like a normal hotel roof covered with assorted transport from speeder bikes and airspeeders to a couple of taxis—providing a discreet perimeter defense in case someone had tracked the strike team back to Qibbu's. The whole place simmered with tension and—yes, it was there, very subtly, but it <em class="calibre6">was</em> there—fear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If Vau's bringing the rest of the thermal, who's minding the prisoners?” Darman said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't imagine they'll take much minding now,” Ordo said. “But Enacca's around.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So who's going to help him haul fifty kilos of deadweight?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo looked faintly irritated. He still felt to Etain like a disjointed turmoil of emotions held in place by a ferociously intelligent logic. She had classified him as dangerous without really knowing why.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau,” he said carefully, “is still a fit man. A soldier since childhood, just like you and like <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> He can carry fifty kilos on his own almost as well as you can.” Ordo adjusted the pile of sealed packs so they lined up perfectly, as if that mattered very much to him. “And if Enacca doesn't need to guard prisoners, she'll help him carry the ordnance. Either way, stop worrying.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, that's <em class="calibre6">my</em> job,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had a very good idea what <em class="calibre6">doesn't need to guard prisoners</em> meant. If they had ceased to be useful, then they were a liability here, just as they were on Qiilura. And they would be shot.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman killed Separatists when he couldn't take them prisoner. She'd watched him do it: clean, quick, passionless. And—was this the dark side finally pulling her over the edge?—even if she would hesitate to do it herself, she was no longer appalled that he or his comrades did.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He looked up from the packets and gave her a broad smile. There was never even a hint of darkness in him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's perfectly safe,” he said. She realized she was frowning at him and that he had taken it to be a comment on the pile of instant destruction on the table. “Don't you trust me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She smiled back instinctively. “Of course I trust you.” <em class="calibre6">Yes, I do: you're my friend, my lover.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata emerged from the 'fresher toweling his hair and wearing a change of clothes with his Verpine in its light gray holster. He leaned over Niner to look at the holozine he was reading.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't you ever watch the holonews?” he asked, pointing at the darkened screen on the wall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Too much to take in.” Niner resumed reading. “Other people's complicated lives.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin had settled in the corner with his DC-17 on his lap. They all kept the rifle close to them when they weren't in public. It was too obviously a commando weapon in the street, and had to be replaced by a discreet blaster. But back here, they lavished affection on the Deece again. It was the weapon they had been raised with and now lived by.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had his slung over his shoulder, and he was looking out the window onto the catwalk opposite, the one that linked another level of seedy bars with the concourse below. He was invisible to the Coruscant beyond the transparisteel, but clearly it was painfully visible to <em class="calibre6">him.</em> Etain could feel his longing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had changed since Qiilura. Etain had first sensed him in the Force as good-natured and calm. A year later his facade was as unfailingly cheerful, but the undertow was darker, more desperate. He'd seen too much of the war. And he had glimpsed something even more painful and guaranteed to trouble him: ordinary people on Coruscant, leading normal lives of the kind he would never have.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She didn't need the Force to help her taste that. She could see the constant question on his face when he glanced at couples and families, of all species. <em class="calibre6">Why not me? Why is this life not for me?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was what Darman had asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Family and clan—family and fatherhood—seemed of overwhelming importance to Mandalorian men. They certainly drove Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Etain knew exactly what the Force had in mind for her, and it was not the path of a Jedi any longer. It was to ensure that at least one cloned man was given back the future that had been taken away from him at birth, or whatever cold distant process served for birth in those Kaminoan laboratories.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain would make him a father one day. She would give Darman a <em class="calibre6">son.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">But neither of them had the luxury of a normal life in this war. Her dream would be a secret—even from him for the time being.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Etain put the thought from her mind and closed her eyes to meditate, unselfconscious because she was among true friends.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She drifted in formless calm, hearing only the slowed pace of her own heartbeat, until the door buzzed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She snapped alert again. So did Omega and Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain saw the squad individually as clearly as she did any other beings, and not just because the Force tinted them with their unique shades of character. She had ceased to see their identical faces or their armor, and experienced instead only their distinct personalities and habits.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And yet when they moved—when they switched to their soldier state of being—they were like a single perfect predator.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The buzz made them all look up together, not like ordinary men responding by staggered milliseconds one after the other, but in <em class="calibre6">one movement,</em> absolutely synchronized, and their expressions and the angle of their heads and their frozen alertness were <em class="calibre6">one.</em> Then, with another perfect single movement, they split like a fist opening into fingers and snapped to positions around the room, rifles trained on the door.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Not a word: not one hand signal from Niner. They hadn't even had time to put on their helmets and activate the shared comlink. Whatever told them to move <em class="calibre6">there,</em> do <em class="calibre6">this,</em> watch <em class="calibre6">that,</em> was so thoroughly ingrained in them from drilling that they seemed almost to be operating on instinct.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Their dark, high-cheekboned, exotic faces were expressionless. Except for the rapid blinking, they were completely and utterly still. Etain suddenly saw them as that single exquisite predator again, and it scared her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Their DC-17 rifles all blipped once in unison as each weapon charged up to fire.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau's not due yet. And Delta's on perimeter.” Skirata had his Verpine shatter gun trained this time, not his small blaster—an indication of how much higher he felt the stakes were. “Etain, you feel anything?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nothing.” She was certain she would have perceived a threat by now. She was suddenly aware that she had drawn her lightsaber. She hadn't even felt herself move. “Nothing at all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay … on <em class="calibre6">three …</em> one … two … th—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the door opened. Etain flinched involuntarily, grasping her lightsaber two-handed. A scent hit her, a foul damp musk.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Skirata said. “You <em class="calibre6">di'kut.</em> We could have blown your head off.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner, Ordo, Darman, and Fi made annoyed clicks and sighs and lowered their Deeces. Atin didn't.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau walked in with two straining carryalls and a six-legged, loose-skinned shambles of pale gold short fur ambling behind him. So that was the strill. And the absence of malice and tension had been … ice-cold, calm, utterly detached Walon Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“At'ika,</em> lower your Deece,” Skirata said softly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you say so, Sarge.” And although Atin obeyed, his steady stare at Vau was an eloquent loaded weapon.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Come on in,” said Fi. “Ain't nobody here but us clones.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You could have called ahead,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau lowered the carryalls to the floor, and Ordo pounced on them. “Just challenging your security, like I ought to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, either Delta and Jusik got instantly stupid or they let pass someone they knew, so don't get too cocky. Anything you want to tell us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've shut down the safe house and Enacca has cleaned up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain listened intently to the language, spoken in the code of euphemism out of long habit. <em class="calibre6">Cleaning up</em> certainly meant removing bloodstains, because she'd seen them, but she had the feeling it was more than that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No further business with our two friends?” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's the trouble with Coruscant,” Vau said. “High balconies are safety risks. At least that confirms our two guests weren't Jedi, eh?” Vau found a seat, and the strill scrambled onto his lap: it took Etain a moment to work out what he meant, and the realization shocked her. “The other fortunate thing is that I was able to talk to Vinna Jiss's supervisor at GAR logistics as her … <em class="calibre6">landlord</em> and complain that she had skipped owing me rent. The supervisor was sympathetic and said she was an unreliable employee.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So?” said Skirata. Omega had disappeared back to the rooms that led off the main one. Except Atin: Atin waited, a block of black hatred, and Ordo stacked the explosives.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So at least we don't have to worry about her being missed too badly.” Vau glanced at Atin, almost as if he was seeking a greeting, but got no reaction. “And she confirmed that there was one other person in logistics that she had to leave information for in an agreed place, a dead letter drop inside the GAR complex, whenever she could manage it. In a locker in the female 'freshers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What? You're kidding me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know. We spend millions on the latest ships but we're stuffed by a simple security leak that wouldn't baffle a Kitonak grocer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain felt Skirata generate a little dark vortex of rage. His face drained of color. “Why are they so <em class="calibre6">shabla</em> clueless?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because they're a bureaucracy, and they're not the ones in the front line. Anyway, none of the traffic information is impossible to dig out by other routes. It's just quick and easy—all wrapped up in one chip. Worth having because it saves them a lot of time, which means they don't have many personnel. Small and opportunistic network, I reckon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was rubbing his face slowly with both hands, exasperated and weary. “So she didn't know who collected the data, other than that they could use the female 'freshers without attracting attention? Or what their schedule was?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If she had known, I can guarantee she would have told me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll bet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So we need someone in there to flush that person out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's me,” Ordo said, and went on making the thermal plastoid into neat piles. Etain had counted two hundred small rectangular packets so far. “All I have to do is withdraw the trooper who's seconded to the transport division and step in.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And what happens to him?” Vau said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He stays here until I'm finished,” Ordo said. “You can make a commando of him in the meantime, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, this is going to be very cozy.” Vau rubbed the still's back, and it shuddered with visible delight. “Because you have to find room for me, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then the strill sleeps on the landing platform,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then I do, too,” said Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi emerged from the room he shared with Atin and stared at the animal. “We could always leave it downstairs in the bar as an air freshener.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One day, RC-eight-oh-one-five,” Vau said, smiling with unusual sincerity, “you might be very glad of Mird's natural talents.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain suspected they were not dissimilar to its master's.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“So <em class="calibre6">this</em> is why you write off my debt,” Qibbu said. He swallowed a pickled gorg whole and sighed. “You use my fine establishment as a base so that trouble does not follow you home.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Too right,</em> Skirata thought.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My little girl needs to start up her own <em class="calibre6">business,”</em> he said, beaming convincingly at Etain. “So she can look after her old dad in his dotage.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain looked suitably sullen. She continued to surprise him with her capacity to do whatever was needed. She could act brave, and she could act calm, and now she could act the wayward and spoiled daughter of an overprotective mercenary.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“She is too skinny to make a living as a bounty hunter,” Qibbu said, and shook with laughter. <em class="calibre6">“Mando</em> females are supposed to be big and <em class="calibre6">tough.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Her mother, the <em class="calibre6">chakaar,</em> was a Corellian and she left me to bring the girl up,” said Skirata. “What Etain lacks in muscle she makes up for in business acumen.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah, I <em class="calibre6">thought</em> your fondness for the Republic's army would prove to have a financial motive. You care nothing for your … <em class="calibre6">boys.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Kal bit the inside of his cheek. “No. You ever met a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad</em> who cared about the Republic?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. So what is for sale?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Something armies have a great deal of.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah … you follow the news closely.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata made a silent vow to be very, <em class="calibre6">very</em> kind to Mar Rugeyan in future. That turf war cover story had worked all too well and the man probably didn't even know it. “There does seem to be a sudden gap in the arms market, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre6">made</em> that gap, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">His stomach somersaulted. He managed a grin. “I'm not that big a player.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu swallowed the hint whole like a gorg. “So what can you obtain?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Blasters, assault rifles, thermal plastoid, ammunition. Anything larger than that I'll treat as a special order and it might take longer. Don't ask for any warships, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu laughed. “I put out the word and we see if it attracts customers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sure I can rely on your discretion. You like this place, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want no trouble finding its way back here. But I will expect … commission. Twenty percent.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's my dowry,” Etain said sourly. “Papa, are you going to let this <em class="calibre6">chakaar</em> steal from me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fierfek, she was getting <em class="calibre6">good,</em> this kid. “ 'Course not, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.”</em> Skirata leaned toward Qibbu and jangled his length of chain in his pocket as a little reminder. “Five percent, and I'll see that your lovely establishment here remains in one piece and unvisited by the riffraff of this world.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Qibbu gurgled. “If this partnership is successful, we renegotiate terms later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You get the business and we'll see.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood up as calmly as he could and led Etain out onto the walkway to get some fresh air. The smell of frying, stale ale, and strill was getting to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought <em class="calibre6">chakaar</em> was a nice touch,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I pick up the odd word.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Actually, that was hard. I envy your nerve.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You reckon?” Skirata held out his hand, fingers spread, palm down. It was shaking. She needed to know that in case she thought he was invincible, and her misplaced faith got her killed. “I'm just a soldier. A commando, you'd call it. I'm groping my way through all this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But Qibbu's scared of you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't have any problems with killing people. That's all.” The reality of his situation had become starkly clear now: edging farther and farther out on that limb, either to safety or to plummet into the torrent rushing beneath, with a breath between one extreme and the other. <em class="calibre6">And no way of stepping back onto the riverbank.</em> “If anything happens to me, I need to know someone will look out for my boys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're asking me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's only you and <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> to ask.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nothing is going to happen to you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The Force is telling you that, is it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What else does the Force tell you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What I have to do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If and when we meet these scum face-to-face, are you up for it? Can't have my boys visible. Too obvious.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not Bardan?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't have to ask <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika.</em> He'll want to be there anyway. I'm asking <em class="calibre6">you.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll do whatever you command. You have seniority here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was hoping for an expression of confidence rather than obedience.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But it would have to do.</div>

<div class="paragraph">–Organized Crime Unit squad briefing, CSF HQ, 383 days after Geonosis</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Logistics center, Grand Army of the Republic, Coruscant </strong><strong class="calibre11">Command HQ, 1000 hours, 383 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Ordo walked through the center's doors unchallenged this time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good morning, sir,” the sentry droid said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo shoved his stylus probe in the droid's dataport again and downloaded its latest recognized-personnel file. “Carry on,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Before he reached the operations room of the logistics wing, he stepped into the male fresher and ran the downloaded images of all the center's organic staff through his helmet's HUD to memorize every face. About 5 percent had changed since his last visit. Civilian staff moved on. Supervisor Wennen, he noted, was still there.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he copied all the data stored in his helmet to his datapad and wiped the HUD's memory. His armor was completely clean now, with no trace of who or what he was other than a classified ARC trooper tally ID. His sole connection to the special forces world would be the tiny bead comlink in his ear. His final task was to slide a wide-angle strip cam into the ventilation grille that passed between the male 'freshers and the female ones.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he replaced his helmet and walked into the operations room. There was no sign of Besany Wennen; the third-shift supervisor, a Nimbanel, was on duty.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“'Morning, sir,” Corr said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just observing today, trooper,” Ordo said. He stood back as if watching the array of live traffic holocharts that covered the circular wall of the ops room, making it feel like the inside of an illuminated drum. In fact, his gaze was on Corr as he worked and occasionally moved around the room. Ordo was taking a crash course in how the trooper moved so that he could mimic him. He already had the measure of his voice with its faint flash-learned accent.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And the civilians always seemed to think he was looking in the direction that his helmet was facing. The basic trooper helmet's specification was available to anyone working in logistics, but they seemed to be unaware of its visual range. Who cared what a trooper could and could not see?</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">They ignore so much data, these civilians.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Corr, I need you to show me something,” Ordo said. The civilians also seemed to ignore conversations between clones. “Come with me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr picked up his helmet, put the security code lock on his workstation with his gauntlet tally<em class="calibre6">–good man, follows the regulations—</em>and followed Ordo out of the room. They walked back down the corridor and Ordo gestured him into the 'freshers, marching him into the far end where the lockers were.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is where you have to follow my orders to the letter,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr looked suddenly wary. “Yes sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Armor off. We're swapping suits.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sir?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remove your armor. I need it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr began unfastening the gription panels without argument and stacked the plates on the floor. Ordo did the same. They both stood there in black bodysuits, suddenly without visible rank, and Ordo was reminded of the price Corr had paid. He looked at the trooper's artificial hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Was it very painful?” asked Ordo, who had never been that badly injured.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't remember a thing, sir, but it hurt when I woke up in the bacta tank.” He pushed back his sleeves: he had lost both arms from just above the elbow. “I manage okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had no idea what to say. “You should be invalided out. You shouldn't be going back to the front.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about my brothers? What am I without them?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had no answer to that, either. He snapped Corr's plates onto his own suit. It was a tight fit: he had always known that the experimental genotype that had so disappointed Kaminoan quality control had made the Nulls slightly heavier in build than the clone trooper and clone commando batches. His armor would be a little loose on Corr.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“At least you get to play captain, then. Enjoy it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr attached the plates and had some trouble snapping the <em class="calibre6">kama</em> into place. Ordo adjusted it and put the pauldron on his shoulders, then handed him the helmet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Wow, this feels different,” Corr said, looking down at himself. The ARC trooper armor was built to a higher spec. “It's heavier than I thought.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get those shoulders back a bit farther and let the <em class="calibre6">kama</em> and the holsters hang like <em class="calibre6">that.”</em> Ordo placed the helmet on Corr's head and was suddenly surprised to be staring back at himself: so <em class="calibre6">that</em> was how he looked to the world. “Take this datapad and walk out of the front doors. You'll be met by a taxi piloted by a Wookiee. Do <em class="calibre6">not</em> stop and do <em class="calibre6">not</em> talk to anyone. Just walk out as if you were me, and you'll be taken to a place where you'll be among brothers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very good, sir. How long?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo tried on Corr's helmet. It felt foreign. It smelled of a stranger: different food, different soap. “I don't know. Just savor the break and I'll see you later. What do you call the civilians?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I address them by their last name, except for the supervisors, whom I call <em class="calibre6">ma'am</em> or <em class="calibre6">sir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Even Wennen?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr paused. “We use first names when not in the center itself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo tucked Corr's helmet under his arm. “Good. Off you go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They left the 'freshers a few seconds apart, and Ordo watched Corr disappear up the corridor. The weight of the <em class="calibre6">kama</em> and blasters gave him an authentic swagger. Ordo found it quite touching and turned back to the operations room to get used to being a simple <em class="calibre6">meat can,</em> a clone trooper that nobody—except the enemy, of course—dreaded or feared or avoided.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had at least one shift to settle in before the biggest risk to his cover turned up. Besany Wennen seemed to be the one taking the most interest in Corr. He would have to be careful to get past her scrutiny. But he had a few hours to practice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He unlocked the workstation and became compliant, conscientious CT-51 08/8843, invisible to the world. The job of checking that supplies had reached the correct battalion in the field and that contractors' schedules hadn't slipped was a simple one, and he occupied himself thinking of ways to make the system more efficient. He resisted the urge to upgrade the system there and then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he watched those around him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry I'm late,” said a woman's voice behind him, a level, mellow voice with an undertone of warmth that sounded as if she were permanently smiling, the higher frequencies betraying a shortened vocal tract. “I'll work an extra hour for you tomorrow. Thanks for holding the fort.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had no time to perfect his simple-trooper act. He glanced over his shoulder as he imagined Corr might, and gave Besany Wennen a slight nod that felt like it came a little too easily to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She smiled back. Ordo suspected she too was a consummate actor. But something in him greatly enjoyed that smile.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational</strong><strong class="calibre11">house, Qibbu's Hut, 2015 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">383 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Name your time for a discussion about the goods,” the stranger's voice said over the comlink. “And we'll name the place.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't like the sound of that. Nor did Vau, evidently. He was listening to the comlink, too, scanner in one hand, and shaking his head slowly, tapping out a random pattern in the air with a forefinger. <em class="calibre6">Can't trace the transmission point. Multiple relay. Just like us.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo grabbed his gauntlet from the table and activated a holochart, holding it where Skirata could see it. The whole strike team was waiting on the conversation, including the clone trooper called Corr whose life had suddenly taken a turn for the bizarre that day.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm going to need a little more reassurance than that,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm an intermediary,” the voice said. <em class="calibre6">Coruscanti accent. No clue at all.</em> “What reassurance would you like?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A very public place. If we both like what we see, and we trust each other, we meet somewhere more private to iron things out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you bring a sample.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Assault rifles? In <em class="calibre6">public?”</em> This was the test question, the one that would sort the gangsters from the Separatists. Weapons were instantly useful to criminals: raw explosives weren't, not unless you wanted to resell them. “Don't <em class="calibre6">takis</em> me, <em class="calibre6">di'kut.</em> My father didn't raise a stupid son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My clients suggested you could obtain military-grade explosives.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can. So you want a sample of <em class="calibre6">that?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Silence. Vau listened, head cocked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We do. What are you offering?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Top military-spec five-hundred-grade thermal plastoid.” Pause. “I think that fits the bill.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a forest of enthusiastically raised thumbs in the hushed room. For some reason Skirata found himself focused on the anxious face of clone trooper Corr, perched on the edge of a chair with one of Dar's custom dets dismantled in his prosthetic hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Noon tomorrow,” Skirata said. He winked at Jusik. “And I'll have my <em class="calibre6">nephew</em> with me, just in case.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“On the south side of the Bank of the Core Plaza.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll spot me easily enough. I have a strill.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau's face was a study in shock, but—like the professional soldier he was—he said nothing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's a strill?” the disembodied voice said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A disgustingly ugly, smelly Mandalorian hunting animal. You can't mistake it for any other species, not even in <em class="calibre6">this</em> menagerie of a city.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Noon, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The link went dead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nobody but Seps would want five-hundred-grade thermal,” Vau said. “Too exotic for the average criminal. They certainly bit on the bait fast. Should that worry us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They've lost their usual supplier, and this is far better stuff.” Skirata watched Delta descend on the holochart and begin planning sniper positions around the banking plaza. “This is purely surveillance unless they start shooting, okay, lads? Killing them there won't help us trace their nests. Least of all in broad daylight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Understood, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev managed a smile. “As long as we get to use lethal rounds later. We like <em class="calibre6">dead.</em> Dead is very us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I added some Dust to the unenriched thermal,” Jusik said. “You want some made into Verpine projectiles, so you can tag anyone you spot and track them, too?” Jusik was a ferociously clever lad and Skirata prized intelligence very much, as much as loyalty and courage. “I thought I'd make sure we didn't have to follow a suspect the hard way again. Am I forgiven for my lapse of judgment the other day?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika,</em> if you ever want a father, then you have one in me,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the highest compliment he could pay him: he was fit to be his son. Jusik might not have fully understood Mandalorian culture yet, but he certainly grasped the sentiment if his embarrassed glance down at the floor and the broad grin were any guide.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss gave Skirata a cautious glance. “Does that mean we get to use your Verp rifles?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're such a pushover for fancy kit,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're the business, Sarge … <em class="calibre6">kandosii!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you bend them, and I'll bend you. They cost me a fortune, and they <em class="calibre6">do not bounce.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“How you going to get the caliber of those marker pellets right, though, Bardan?” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Multicaliber magazine and bore,” Skirata said. “You could load these Verps with stones if you needed to. That's what cost the money. That and the full-spectrum range of filters, variable velocity, and anti-reflective device.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kandosii,”</em> Sev said, almost sighing. “Shame you didn't pay a bit extra to make them more robust.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Cheeky <em class="calibre6">di'kut ...</em> okay, I reckon you're good enough to use them. Take a look.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata went to the cupboard and slid out one of the precious rifles, disassembled into three discrete parts: thirty-centimeter barrels, matte drab green, silent, horribly accurate, and Jaing's weapon of choice for <em class="calibre6">going hiking with extreme prejudice,</em> as he described it. Sheer ballistic beauty. An assassin's tool: a <em class="calibre6">craftsman's</em> tool.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He hadn't seen Jaing in months. He missed him. He missed all the Nulls badly when they were on long, distant missions.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss and Sev fondled the rifles and beamed. Even Fixer looked happy. The Delta boys didn't respond to food treats and pats on the head, then, but they loved new toys and praise. Skirata noted that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I need accurate ranges from your recce,” Jusik said. “I've got to pack the Dust into a medium that'll stay together until it's right at the target, or the stuff will disperse too soon. This has to splatter them close to the face so they inhale it, or it'll just sit on their clothing. If they dump their jackets, we'll lose them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fun,” Sev said, and obviously meant it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau got up and wandered out toward the landing platform, no doubt to fuss over Lord Mirdalan before the slobbering thing did a real job for once in its life. When he was out of earshot, Boss turned to Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sargeant Vau loves that animal. Don't let anything happen to it. <em class="calibre6">Please.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I won't. It knows I carry a knife.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr, who had been the subject of much fussing and attention since Jusik had brought him back to Qibbu's, watched cautiously. Skirata ruffled his hair. He flinched. “Sorry about all this, son. Learning a lot?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sargeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Want to be useful? I mean even more useful than you are now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. <em class="calibre6">Please.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Poor little <em class="calibre6">di'kut.</em> Skirata fought the urge to collect another damaged young boy, another stray in need of belonging, and lost immediately. He had been that orphan, and a soldier had rescued him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dar, give him a crash course in using a DC-17, will you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Boss and Sev slid the discreet body armor plates under their tunics and checked their hand blasters. “Just off for a recce of the location, then,” Boss said. “Back in two hours, and then I suggest we insert as soon as possible so we're there before the bad guys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What makes you think they won't be doing the same right now?” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because it looks like a very hard location to lay up in for any length of time, and we're pros, and they're not,” said Boss. “So they'll probably go in closer to the rendezvous time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata made a point of looking around the group so that he could see the reaction of the two Jedi. Both of them were very capable warriors but assassination—killing someone who was not about to kill you—was psychologically <em class="calibre6">very</em> different from using a lightsaber or blaster in combat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The silent excitement that had gripped the room was palpable.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen—ma'am—this is a shoot-to-kill operation,” he said. “Not <em class="calibre6">arrest.</em> We want as many <em class="calibre6">hut'uune</em> identified, located, and dead by any means possible at the end of this deployment. Nothing else. We're cutting out a big chunk of this network in one slice. Are we all clear that's what we're doing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes Sarge!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was one voice. And Jusik and Etain were part of it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was good. Anyone who hesitated would get the rest of the strike team killed, or worse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, recce team, move out,” Skirata said. “And don't you <em class="calibre6">dare</em> drop my Verps.”</div>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Mandalorians are surprisingly unconcerned with biological lineage. Their definition of offspring or parent is more by relationship than birth: adoption is extremely common, and it's not unusual for soldiers to take war orphans as their sons or daughters if they impress them with their aggression and tenacity. They also seem tolerant of marital infidelity during long separations, as long as any child resulting from it is raised by them. Mandalorians define themselves by culture and behavior alone. It is an affinity with key expressions of this culture—loyalty strong self identity, emphasis on physical endurance and discipline-that causes some ethnic groups such as those of Concord Dawn in particular to gravitate toward Mandalorian communities, thereby reinforcing a common set of genes derived from a wide range of populations. The instinct to be a protective parent is especially dominant. They have accidentally bred a family-oriented warrior population, and continue to reinforce it by absorbinglike-minded individuals and groups.</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">This was no place for a fighting man to be when his brothers were out in the field, but Ordo reasoned that the faster he identified and neutralized the informant, the sooner he could leave this office job.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clone,” the Nimbanel voice said. The creature was riding him today. It was a bad idea—normally. <em class="calibre6">“Clone!</em> Have you input the overnight batch of data yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I know at least ten ways to kill you without a weapon, lizard. I'd like to try them all.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Gurus,” Ordo said, being nice, compliant Corr. “I have.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then you should have told me immediately.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo heard Skirata's constant admonishment in his head and kepthis temper: <em class="calibre6">Udesii, udesii, ad'ika—easy, easy, son.</em> This clerk wasn't fit to clean Corr's boots. He certainly wasn't fit to clean <em class="calibre6">his.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“My apologies,” Ordo said, acting the calm man that he definitely wasn't right then. “It won't happen again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Besany Wennen raised her head from her screen very slowly. She was distressingly pretty. The symmetry of her features made him uncomfortable because he wanted to stare, and his male instinct said <em class="calibre6">pursue,</em> but his brain said <em class="calibre6">suspect.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gurus, if you have a concern about data management, may I suggest you raise it with me first?” The warmth in her voice had disappeared completely. The frequency dropped as her lips compressed. Ordo could see her in his peripheral vision: she had a way of switching off that vivid smile and just freezing for a few moments. This was someone used to obedience in those around her. “Trooper Corr is doing what I asked of him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had no idea if that was true or if she was saving him embarrassment. He managed a placatory smile anyway. Watching Corr last night had honed his act a little more.</div>

<div class="paragraph">As he worked, inputting vessel pennant codes and supply routes into the program that fed the wall display, he pondered on the one solid piece of information he had. The advance schedule for movements of men and materiel was stripped out to provide confirmation messages. One internal stream went to GAR logistics battalions and Fleet Ops, and one external stream was relayed to the thousands of civilian contractors who provided supplies and transport. The two sets of data were different.</div>

<div class="paragraph">So this had to be the data that was left on a chip at the drop point within the complex—the one that Vinna Jiss had helpfully described to Vau whether she wanted to or not. The bomb attacks had been spread throughout the contractor and military supply networks; whoever executed the attacks had both sets of data.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And copying data showed no audit trail. Relaying data from the system did. And <em class="calibre6">that</em> was what routine security watched. Old tech beat state-of-the-art with depressing frequency.</div>

<div class="paragraph">All Ordo had to do now was watch the surveillance images of the drop point at the female 'freshers. So far it had picked up nothing. He had no idea how frequently the Separatist contact—and he had to assume it was one—checked the locker, but nobody had shown up. Maybe they hadn't missed Jiss yet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was nearly noon when Supervisor Wennen got up and left the operations room. On a whim, Ordo laid his helmet on its side on the desk next to him at an angle where he could discreetly view the feed from the 'freshers playing out on his HUD.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen was <em class="calibre6">not</em> the kind of woman who belonged here. Some uneasiness told him so. <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> had told him that a strong hunch was usually based on subconscious observation of hard facts, and was to be treated with respect.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The grainy blue image showed Wennen entering the 'freshers. She didn't glance around. She paused at the lockers, scanned along them with her head moving visibly, tucked a strand of pale hair behind one ear, and bent to open several unlocked doors until she appeared to tire of it and left again. She reappeared in the ops room a minute later and gave him a regretful smile that appeared utterly sincere.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Something had irked her.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Ah,</em> Ordo thought, disappointed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he wondered why he felt that disappointment, and realized it was due to impulses unconnected to the business in hand. And business, of course, had just taken a turn for the better.</div>

<div class="paragraph">His shift finished when hers did, at 1600.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He would spend the next few hours working out exactly how to remove her without alerting any other Separatist contacts that might be in her cell. He wanted them <em class="calibre6">all.</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">1100 hours, 384 days after Geonosis, commercial zone, </strong><strong class="calibre11">Quadrant N-09: agreed meeting point to open negotiations </strong><strong class="calibre11">with interested parties</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Lazy <em class="calibre6">chakaare,”</em> Fi said, glancing at his chrono. “What time do they call this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, if they got here before us and we can't see 'em … we're probably dead meat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman was somewhere on the opposite side of the Bank of the Core Plaza, three floors above the pedestrian area in a storeroom he had infiltrated. Fi couldn't see him, but his voice was clearly audible in his head: the bead comlink was so sensitive that it picked up subvocalization via the eustachian tube.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They'd been here since 2330 last night. They had observed and noted every cleaning droid, automated walkway sweeper, late worker, early-morning commuter, shopper, drunk, CSF foot patrol, delivery repulsor, unlicensed caf vendor, and truant schoolkid that had passed in and out of the plaza from any direction. They had also swept the cliff walls of office buildings and—to Fi's great interest—noted that some employees did <em class="calibre6">not</em> catch up with the filing after hours if they had colleagues of the opposite sex with them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And every couple of hours, Etain Tur-Mukan had walked briskly across the plaza as if she had business somewhere, sweeping the area with whatever extra sense Jedi had that enabled them to detect concealed people. Etain was said to be good at that. She could place the squad to within a meter. Each time she passed, Fi heard Darman move or swallow, and he wasn't sure if it was because he could see her or because she was reaching out to him in the Force.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi suddenly wanted the uncomplicated focus of a totally military life on Kamino.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You're getting distracted. Think of the job in hand.</em> Maybe they'd let him keep the bead comlink after this op. They'd never miss a few back at HQ. <em class="calibre6">Surely.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want my HUD back,” Darman said. “I want my enhanced view.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you get to wear face camo instead. Makes you feel wild and dangerous.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm wild,” Sev's voice said. Sev was behind a roof balustrade under a pile of discarded plastoid sheeting. “And then I get dangerous. <em class="calibre6">Shut up.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that,” Fi said cheerfully, and clicked his back teeth twice to exit Sev's open comlink channel. It was far too noisy an environment for their quiet conversation to be heard anyway. “Miserable <em class="calibre6">di'kut.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't mind him.” Scorch was at walkway level about fifty meters west of the meeting point, lying prone in a disused horizontal access shaft. “He'll be fine once he's killed something.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman had a Verpine rifle with live rounds, as did Sev. Fi and Scorch had the nonlethal tracking projectiles, twelve rounds each. The Verp was truly lovely. Fi had always wondered just how many credits Sergeant Kal had made over the years. His growing collection of expensive, exotic weapons and the modest extravagance of his bantha jacket were the only visible signs that it might have been a <em class="calibre6">lot.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dar—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Possible contact, first walkway level, my left of the bank entrance …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi adjusted his scope and tracked right. It was a boy he'd seen before: human, very short scrubby light hair, gangly. He was still hanging around the plaza. If he was a Sep, he was a disgracefully amateurish one. They watched for a few minutes, and then a young girl in a bright yellow tunic raced up to the boy and flung her arms around him. They kissed enthusiastically, drawing glances from passersby.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think he knows her,” Fi said. He felt his face burn. It bothered him and he looked away.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that's just you and Niner left on the shelf now that your brothers are spoken for,” Scorch said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a pause. Darman cut in. “You got a point to make, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think it's kind of encouraging.” Scorch chuckled. “Atin gets a cute Twi'lek, Dar gets his very own general—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“—and Scorch gets a thick ear if he doesn't <em class="calibre6">shut it right now”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The comlink was suddenly silent except for the occasional sound of swallowing. Darman wasn't in a joking mood when it came to Etain. He never had been, not even on Qiilura, when there hadn't been anything going on between them.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Why is this hurting so much? Why do I feel I've been cheated?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Kal'buir, <em class="calibre6">why didn't you prepare me for this?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was too distracting. Fi shut his eyes for a few moments and went into the sequence he had learned to center himself when the battlefield pressed in on him: controlled breathing, concentrating on nothing except the next inhalation, ignoring everything that wasn't of the next moment. It took a while. He shut out the world.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he found that he had his eyes open without even realizing and he was simply following movement on the plaza below through the breathtakingly accurate scope of the Verpine rifle.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now, do we get the best kit or what?” he said, becoming the confident man he wanted to be again. “Name me another army where you get handcrafted Verps to play with.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The Verpine army,” Scorch said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do they have an army?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do they need one?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Silence descended again. At 1150 Sev cut into the comlink circuit. “Stand by. Kal's moving into position.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata wandered into the plaza from the direction of the Senate with Jusik one on side and an excited Lord Mirdalan straining on a leash on the other. He was doing a credible job of looking as if the strill were his constant companion. The animal seemed remarkably content with him, given the number of times Skirata had driven it off or thrown his knife at it over the years. Maybe the riot of strange new scents had thrilled the strill enough that it didn't much care that the man who usually shouted at it was holding the leash. Fi watched as they took up a position near the door, sitting down on an ornate durasteel seat shaped like a bow.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's voice came over the comlink circuit.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How's my boys?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Cramp, Sarge,” Darman said. “And Fi's dribbling over your Verpine.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He can clean it, then. Ready?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ready.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">At 1159 a human male in his forties—green casual tunic, brown pants, collar-length brown hair, beard, tall, lean build—walked toward Skirata and Jusik in a purposeful line. Fi tracked him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got him, Fi,” Darman said. If anything went wrong, the man would be dead in a fraction of a second from a silent high-kinetic round in his back.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Escort,” Sev said. “Looks like three … no, four. Three male, one female, all human … one male twenty meters south of Darman. Spread out but all moving toward Skirata.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got the female,” Scorch said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You sure they're with the Beard?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, check their eyeline, Fi. They're watching him, nothing else. They're pretty cool about it but they're obviously not professionals. They shouldn't even be looking his way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain's voice cut in. “There's another female approaching slowly on the Senate side of the bench. I'm moving in behind her so you can spot her.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev cut in. “Any more?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can only sense four others plus the man approaching Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Aww, look. They've taken up positions to block the main pedestrian routes off the plaza. Thank you! I love a target that identifies itself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hope this doesn't turn into a shooting match,” Scorch said. “Too many civvies.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can get a clear shot,” Sev said. “And I can take at least three out from here. Relax. You just worry about tagging 'em.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Tagging.</em> Would they feel it?</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi dropped in an EM filter with a touch on the optics housing. He focused the scope on the woman now standing almost under Darman's position by the walkway heading toward Quadrant N-10: shoulder-length red hair, blue business suit, tan leather document bag. The filter detected electromagnetic emissions, which made it not only handy for locating someone operating a comlink but also just <em class="calibre6">perfect</em> for seeing if Dust had hit its target. It cast a pinkish brown tinge across the image.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He checked for indications of wind speed. The woman's hair was moving slightly in the breeze: a flimsi cup discarded near the caf vendor rolled a little way along the paving. Fi adjusted his scope and checked the air temperature, which had crept up a fraction in the last twenty minutes. He adjusted the Verp's settings again and settled the weapon on his forearm.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Relax. Power coil set to medium. Don't want her to feel the projectile hit her. Don't want to spray the Dust over the whole plaza, either …</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The crosshairs settled.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“So that's a strill.”</em> The man's voice was a little fuzzy but Fi could hear the accent, even if he didn't recognize it. <em class="calibre6">“Charming. Call me Perrive.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“And you can call me Kal.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi closed his eyes for a second and slowed his breathing. When he opened them, the aim was still dead center of the woman's chest.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“So let's see the goods.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi exhaled slowly and held his breath.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Here. Take it and have it tested.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's finger tightened on the end of the trigger. The Verp was so finely constructed that all he felt was a sudden lack of resistance under his finger and the rifle fired—silent and without recoil.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“How much stuff in all?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Hundred kilos. More if you need it.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">A smoke-like white puff billowed in Fi's filter. The projectile had burst on contact, showering the woman with microscopic tracking powder, each tiny fragment capable of relaying its location back to the base receiver at Qibbu's—or even to a HUD. She glanced down as if an insect had landed on her and then simply brushed the end of her nose as if she'd inhaled pollen.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Five hundred grade?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“All of it,”</em> said Kal.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Dets?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“How many?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Three or four thousand.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Five-hundred-grade—I have it. Dets—just a matter of acquiring them discreetly. A day maybe.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Confirm—female target in blue, <em class="calibre6">marked.”</em> Fi tracked the rifle ninety degrees to his left. “Targeting the male farthest from Kal. Black jacket.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Breathe easy. Relax.</em> He aimed and adjusted the scope again, held his breath at the comfortable point of exhalation, and fired for a second time. Again, the man reacted and looked for something on his chest, then carried on watching Skirata as if nothing had happened.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Male, black jacket—target <em class="calibre6">marked.</em> So they <em class="calibre6">can</em> feel it strike, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't hog them all,” Scorch said. “I want a go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All yours, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Targeting the male right of Skirata, gray robe …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi lined up his EM scope on Scorch's target to observe. Scorch's breathing paused, and then Fi saw a puff of white smoke bloom on the gray robe. He didn't react at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now the other male, red vest, left of Skirata by the caf vendor … no, keep still, you <em class="calibre6">di'kut …</em> that's better.” Scorch was silent again. Fi watched through the EM filter. The projectile burst neatly on the man's shoulder and he brushed his nose without noticing, just like the first woman. Maybe it was a combination of seeing absolutely nothing as 'the pellet's binding agent vaporized, and being hyped up on adrenaline during a mission. They weren't tuned in to much beyond seeing and not being seen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, who's taking Beard Guy? Perrive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me,” Fi said. “If I make it three for three, do I get to keep him? Y'know, stuffed and mounted?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He'd make a nice stand for your Hokan armor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive—Beard Guy—stood at a slight angle, moving a little as he spoke to Skirata. He held the small pack of thermal plastoid in his hand, about a hundred grams of it, and was squeezing it between his fingers while glancing at the wrapping. It looked for all the world like a spice deal, and Fi wondered for a moment if they were all blind to how obvious that might appear.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Worry about that later. Tag him.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Turn around, <em class="calibre6">chakaar.</em> I don't want to hit your back.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had settled into a rhythm now. He watched through the scope as Perrive slipped the plastoid into his pocket and stood with one hand on his belt, turning idly back and forth, presenting a good expanse of back and then a narrow angle of shoulder.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi relaxed, aimed and went for the shoulder, anticipating the turn.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Whuff.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The tracker projectile struck home and got no reaction.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Okay we'll take a look at this and get back to you tomorrow at noon,”</em> Perrive said. <em class="calibre6">“If we like it, we meet somewhere private. If we don't, you never hear from me again.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Suits me,”</em> said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about the second woman?” Fi said. “Etain, where are you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“About three meters to her left.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can you edge her clear of the civvies?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi listened. Skirata could hear all this on his comlink bead, too. It took some skill to carry on talking with someone having a five-way conversation in your ear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Excuse me,” Etain said. “I'm hopelessly lost. Can you show me how I get to Quadrant N-Ten?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi watched as the woman simply paused, looked at Etain with surprise, and then began pointing out the connecting walkway. Etain moved. The woman stepped out farther, pointing again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” Etain said, and walked on.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Whuff.</em> The projectile plumed light on the woman's shoulder. And she brushed her nose.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All six tagged,” Fi said. He changed channels with an exaggerated click of his molars. “Niner, you receiving?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got 'em all,” said Niner's voice, several quadrants away in Qibbu's. “Nice vivid traces on the holochart.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay.” Fi let his head drop to ease his neck muscles. “You can wind up now, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The old <em class="calibre6">di'kut's</em> good at it, isn't he?” Scorch betrayed a grudging fondness. Skirata could hear the conversation and Scorch knew it. “I'd love to know where he learned to do all that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's face didn't even twitch. Nor did Jusik's. Jusik was just looking around as a gangster's errand boy was supposed to, appearing alert but not too bright.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“My intermediary says you have lots of army friends,”</em> Perrive said.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Contacts,”</em> Skirata said. <em class="calibre6">“Not friends.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Don't like our army, then?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Just useful. Just clones.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Not worried what happens to them?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“You're not some</em> di'kutla <em class="calibre6">liberal, trying to recruit me, are you, son? No, I don't give a mott's backside about clones. I'm in this for me and my family.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Just curious. We'll be in touch, if we like the goods.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata simply sat with his hands thrust into his pockets, apparently watching the strill, which had stretched out in an ungainly pile of loose skin with its head under the bench, trailing drool. Jusik chewed vacantly, also staring ahead. Fi and the sniper team watched Perrive and the five targets disperse into walkways and down-ramps.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They waited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anyone else spot a Jabiimi accent there?” Jusik asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata leaned over and appeared to be about to pat Mird. “I reckon so.” Fi waited for it to sink its teeth in him, but he stopped short of touching it and the animal simply rolled over to watch his hand with malevolently curious eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi remembered the strill from Kamino. It seemed smaller now that he was a grown man. Once, it was bigger than he was.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Eventually there was a long sigh of relief. “I sense they're all gone,” Jusik said. “Niner, are they clear of the plaza area?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner grunted. “Confirmed. You can move now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand down, lads,” Skirata said at last. “Well done.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nice job, Etain,” said Darman's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, okay, well done the Mystic Mob, too.” Skirata tugged on Mird's leash; the pile of fur scrambled onto all six legs and shook itself. “Let's thin out carefully, and don't forget to wipe off the face camo before you move. We'll RV back at Qibbu's by thirteen-fifteen. Then get some rest.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sounds good,” Fi said. It was only when the tension had passed that he realized how stiff his joints felt and how much parts of him hurt from twelve hours and more lying prone on the makeshift padding of his jacket. “Hot bath, hot meal, and sleep,”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata cut in. “You know I didn't mean that, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“About clones. Qibbu obviously mentioned you to his scum associates.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course we know, Sarge,” Scorch said. “You said you were in this for your <em class="calibre6">family,</em> didn't you?”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Logistics center, Grand Army of the Republic, Coruscant </strong><strong class="calibre11">Command HQ, 1615 hours, 384 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Ordo listened to his concealed comlink with a practiced expression of blank disinterest while he keyed in traffic movements. The holochart that covered every centimeter of wall space shifted and pulsed as consignments turned from red to green—now laden, cross-checked, and en route—and requests for replenishment stacked up in a panel of blue horizontal bars.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The holochart gave no numbers of troops, but a little common sense would have told anyone who wanted to spend the time thinking through the obvious that they were thinly stretched. There were, Ordo knew, at least a million troops now in the field spread over hundreds of worlds: small forces on some, multiple battalions on others. It meant long supply chains, and those were inherently vulnerable. So … why didn't the Separatist terror networks target them offworld? <em class="calibre6">No ability.</em> No suitable vessels or skills. Or … maybe the point was to intimidate the seat of galactic government after all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Motive mattered. Motive gave you the capacity to think like the enemy, want what they wanted, and then snatch it from them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And killing clone troopers—mainly troopers, if you didn't count the unfortunate civilians who were also in the way—made the point that the Seps could come and go as they pleased.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took it personally. He drew on the memory of sharp, cold fear and focused hatred that he had learned on Kamino before a total stranger had stepped in front of him and saved his life.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">We can trust nobody but our brothers and</em> Kal'buir.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Over the comlink, he could still hear Niner's exclamations of satisfaction. The six men and women tagged by Fi and Sev were dispersing all over Galactic City, leaving routes and stopping points that Niner and Boss were logging on a holo-chart that showed every skylane, quadrant, and building on Coruscant. Judging by their occasional descent into the rich Mandalorian invective that <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> considered an important part of their continuing education, they were learning more than anyone had bargained for.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo would evaluate it all when he returned, but the number of locations that the tagging had registered had now reached twenty; it was growing into something larger than a fourteen-man team might be able to handle.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wanted to tell them to concentrate on the clusters, the areas of most traffic, but it would have to wait. The strip cam had yielded nothing, except the fact that females of all species employed in the center seemed to spend a lot of time in the 'freshers rearranging their appearance. Whoever had been used to collecting the data probably knew Vinna Jiss was gone now and was no doubt trying another route. He kept a careful eye on Supervisor Wennen because she seemed to be getting increasingly agitated as the day wore on. He could hear it in her voice. She didn't like Guris. She was checking something: when he went to the 'freshers, she was still on the same screen when he returned, scrolling up and down an inventory.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was checking rifle shipments going back two or three months. <em class="calibre6">If it's you, Wennen, what is your motive?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He didn't have to stop to read the screen over her shoulder. He could simply glance at it, focus, and walk back to his workstation to close his eyes discreetly and recall what he had seen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Whatever errors the Kaminoans had made in their attempt to improve Jango Fett's genome, the efforts had not been wasted.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen looked up toward the doors. Her fine-boned face, while still aesthetically pleasing, suddenly froze into genuine anger and lost its prettiness.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Jiss,” she said sourly. “You'd better have a <em class="calibre6">good</em> excuse this time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo fought every instinct to jerk around and stare. He simply turned his head casually to focus on a sheet of flimsi to his right, and there she was: Vinna Jiss.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You're dead.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've been unwell, Supervisor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">But you're dead. So who are you?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Heard of comlinks? I even had your landlord calling me, complaining you'd skipped without paying rent.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I know you're dead because you fell a few thousand meters from a balcony after a chat with Walon Vau.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Supervisor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen was all acid, lips compressed. “See me first thing in the morning. I'm off shift now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She shut down her workstation, grabbed her jacket, and made a move toward the doors. Then she paused and turned to Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Corr, it's sixteen-thirty,” she said. “Come on. Time to go. Nobody will thank you for sitting there all night. Want me to drop you off at the barracks?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Jiss, either you're dead or you're an imposter. So who did Vau kill?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you, Supervisor.” Ordo logged off and replaced his helmet, suddenly glad of the chance to hide behind an anonymous white plastoid visor and stare horrified at the face of a dead woman who seemed to be doing pretty well for a corpse. “I'm … I'm going to meet some comrades from the Forty-first. Could you drop me off at the first taxi platform in the entertainment sector, please?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm glad you're taking the opportunity to relax, Corr.” She seemed genuinely pleased. “You deserve it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took one last look at the woman who appeared to be Jiss, memorizing every pore and line, and followed Wennen outside to the speeder bays. He slid into the passenger's seat with a hundred questions that had, for once in his life, yielded no fast answers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen powered up her speeder and sat still for a moment, staring at the console.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Honestly,” she snorted, all exasperation. “That's the most unreliable employee I have <em class="calibre6">ever</em> known. Sometimes I could just <em class="calibre6">kill</em> that woman.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Beads of red light were now dotted throughout the blue holochart of grids and lines that had expanded to fill a space a meter high and two meters long. The tracking Dust was transmitting the movements of the six Separatists they had tagged a few hours earlier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain walked around the 3-D chart, studying tracks that were strung like necklaces with occasional solitary beads placed at intervals. The virtual representation of a section of Galactic City spanned the table. Some of the threads crossed and merged. Niner and Boss were still taking data from it and listing each location while Vau watched with Jusik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They do get around,” Vau said. “Jusik, my boy, has anyone ever told you you're a genius?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik shrugged. “And my friends are excellent shots. Good team, aren't we?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Friends</em> was an unusual way for a Jedi to describe clone troops who were technically his to command and use as he thought fit. But Jusik simply didn't see the world that way. Etain found it deeply touching.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, <em class="calibre6">excellent</em> team,” Vau said. Boss glanced up, evidently pleased. “It's wonderful to watch a job done well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">That wasn't quite the Walon Vau that Etain had sensed and found to be sheer passionless brutality. He was no less complex and contradictory than Skirata. Atin, reading from his datapad, ignored him completely; Vau sometimes glanced at his former trainee but got no reaction.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Atin loathes him. He wants revenge of some kind.</em> Etain found it hard to reconcile that with the methodical, considerate, and courageous man she knew, the one who had felt he had no right to survive Geonosis when his brothers had died.</div>

<div class="paragraph">While the locations were collated, another frustrating hiatus had forced the squads into rest and recovery. They seemed to need to be busy fighting, especially Delta. Etain could taste their collective impatience. Maybe it was youth; but maybe it was that they didn't enjoy having time to think.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi, Sev, Fixer, and Scorch had gone down to the restaurant to eat with Corr, but Darman was asleep in his room. Etain went to check on him and watched him for a while. He lay on his stomach, head turned to one side, cheek resting on folded arms, and twitched occasionally as if dreaming.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They grabbed every small moment together that they could find. And it wasn't enough. Etain kissed his temple and left him to sleep. Skirata, wandering around with his hands deep in his pockets, gave her a conspiratorial wink.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Looks like we've got three clusters in residential areas,” Boss said. “And now about twenty-five other places they've at least stopped for a while, including shops.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood looking at the mesh of colored light. “We can't cover them all,” he said. “The clusters are the priority.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Probably their safe houses or bomb factories.” Boss indicated a static point of red light that hadn't moved in an hour. “I think that's our marked pack of thermal plastoid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Could well be. Got a list now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It gets longer by the hour. How long did you say that Dust can transmit?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik cocked his head, calculating. “Four, perhaps five weeks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I say we recce the cluster points for a day or so, confirm the activity, and then decide which are the priority targets and leave the rest to CSF.” Niner jabbed his finger into the holochart again to indicate another thread growing as the tagged suspect moved to a new location. “This target is trailing the other. No idea why. Maybe providing tail cover.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you draw up a surveillance roster for the next twenty-four hours and be prepared to pull people off it if I get the call from Perrive, or whatever his real name is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata finally allowed himself a little satisfied grin, which put Etain more in mind of a gdan than ever. He gave both Boss and Niner ferocious pats on the back; Boss flinched while Niner turned and smiled, pleased with life. “Nice job. You two go and get something to eat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain fought an urge to walk across to Skirata and hug him. She had finally worked out what was happening. Omega—and Ordo—were clearly used to genuine affection from him: they touched all the time, from roughhousing and crushing hugs to hair ruffling. Delta didn't. They were uncomfortable with it. Whatever relationship they had with Vau was much more distant, more competitive, more a desperate quest for his approval. Skirata played the good father even now, dispensing treats, unashamedly pleased and proud of everything his boys achieved. Vau looked as if he played the master, and being judged good enough was rare.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It made her wonder more than ever about Atin. She would have seized the moment and taken him aside to ask, because it troubled her, but she was interrupted by the return of Fi and Sev. Fi strode up to Atin and grabbed the datapad from his hand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A strange blue woman with no taste in men wants to see you,” he said. “Go on. Laseema's complaining you haven't said hello to her today.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had a knack for teetering on the edge of offense. He also did a very good job of pretending that Atin's good fortune with Laseema didn't bother him one bit. The aching little void at the core of him, so plainly detectable in the Force, said otherwise.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik caught Etain's eye: he spotted it, too. Then he looked past her toward the doors, and she felt something as well—anxiety and distress, very clearly emanating from a presence that could only be Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He strode into the room and began unfastening his armor, jaw clenched. Skirata just waited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So, did you have a good day at the office, dear?” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“She's not dead,” Ordo said. “Vinna Jiss is not dead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Start again, son,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A woman my supervisor identified as Vinna Jiss walked back into the logistics center at sixteen-fifteen today.” He stacked the plates and sat down on the edge of a chair, completely calm except for the telltale gesture of one fist clenched on his knee. He looked up at Vau. “And it <em class="calibre6">was</em> her, or at least she looked the image of the woman Jusik picked up. In one piece. Are you <em class="calibre6">sure</em> you killed her?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau raised an eyebrow. “Oddly enough, yes. Humans don't bounce. I would have spotted that, I think.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then who was that at work today?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You couldn't be mistaken?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo didn't even blink. “I remember <em class="calibre6">everything</em> I see in complete detail. I have eidetic memory. What I saw was the identical image of the woman we detained and who you took for interrogation. Of that much I am <em class="calibre6">absolutely certain.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Skirata said. “Options?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One, she's a twin or a clone.” Ordo counted off on his fingers. “Two, she's some kind of droid designed to mimic her. Three? A Clawdite. Shapeshifting is a useful skill for a terror group to recruit. But why would they want to mimic a dead colleague?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How about that supervisor?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've logged her going into the 'freshers and searching lockers, but now I have no idea if she's working alone or with this Jiss woman. She was genuinely angry when she saw her, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because the other Jiss fouled up, maybe.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We need to do some surveillance on this resurrected Jiss. She's supposed to be on the evening shift, so I'm going back to the center just before midnight and I'll follow her when she leaves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's lips parted but Etain was faster off the mark. “I'll come with you,” she said. “I'll be able to tell you whether she's a droid, at least.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can do that with sensors,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll come with you anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo turned to Skirata. “I don't like mysteries.” He was clearly embarrassed. “I'm sorry, <em class="calibre6">Kai' bait:</em> I'm not resolving this as fast as I should.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Son, this is <em class="calibre6">never</em> a fast game. We're making good progress. Take it easy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Ordo wasn't the type to take it easy. He joined the contemplation of the holochart and picked up Niner's datapad.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll take a clip of those Dust rounds, please, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika,”</em> he said. “Just in case.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata drew his stubby Verpine handgun from his holster. “Better use this, then. More compact than the rifle.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain stood with Vau, watching the erratic progress of the markers around the chart. A hard decision lay within it: at what stage would Skirata feel it was safe to bring CSF in on the surveillance? When would he share information with them? Etain understood his anxiety, but the simple mathematics of the situation was that CSF would be needed sooner or later.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo began logging more locations into the datapad. His jaw muscles were working visibly. It must have been hard for a man used to being smarter than anyone else except his five brothers to handle the ordinary mortals' world of being dumbfounded a lot of the time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh,” Vau said suddenly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell me what this building is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik interrogated the database in the holochart emitter. “CSF Divisional Headquarters.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, well,” said Vau. “How illuminating. Why is one of our tagged bad guys going in <em class="calibre6">there?”</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">There was a lot to be said for having a matte-black army-issue bodysuit.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It provided a reasonable amount of protection against blaster and projectile weapons, and it was low visibility at night, unlike ARC trooper armor. Ordo felt in the pockets of the knee-length dark gray jacket that Vau had lent him and felt compelled to inhale the unfamiliar scent of its wearer: antiseptic soap, weapon-lubricating oil, and a maleness that was not his. But it disguised the skintight suit. That was all it had to do.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It also disguised the Verpine shatter gun in his holster.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What makes you think she's going to stick to her shift hours?” Etain said, looking slightly past him, head almost touching his. They sat in the closed cockpit of a speeder parked a hundred meters from the logistics center, where they could watch the doors. To anyone watching, they were just a young couple in a parked speeder late at night, like a thousand others at that moment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The fact she bothered to return to work at all. That means she wants her pattern to appear normal again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain just nodded. She seemed to be finding it hard to keep up a conversation. Ordo could smell Darman on her, which fascinated him: Darman seemed able to step beyond the community of brothers and not feel adrift, just as his Null brothers could. But Ordo found it distressing, and Fi seemed to as well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wasn't sure if he would ever trust a female, not after Chief Scientist Ko Sai first towered above him, gray and cold and unfeeling. He wondered if having a human mother would have made it easier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain shut her eyes again. She shuddered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not cold,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are there Jedi working here?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course. Jedi make great clerks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll take that as a no.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's a <em class="calibre6">definite</em> no. Why do you ask?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I felt someone in the Force, very faintly.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek. Zey? Jusik being helpful?</em> “Close?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gone now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She went back to silent contemplation of something beyond him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is your PEP laser fully charged?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very noisy and visible. <em class="calibre6">Last resort.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“As is a Verpine round.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have the chamber loaded two and one,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Two marker projectiles between each live round, and one live round already <em class="calibre6">up the spout,</em> as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> so aptly puts it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you can—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Count? I do believe so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I seem to offend you without meaning to. I realize you have an astonishing intellect.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It wasn't that his mind was so remarkable that seemed worth comment, but that hers and others' were <em class="calibre6">not.</em> He felt the need to explain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In an emergency, it's better that I'm able to fire a killing shot without needing to discharge two nonlethal rounds first.” He stared into her eyes: they were light green, flecked with amber. Except for Skirata's, the only eyes so unlike his own that he had ever studied at that range were alien, and shortly before he killed their owner. “Anyway, I can execute a triple tap with a Verpine. So it's academic.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Triple</em> tap? I've heard Dar talk about double—”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Three</em> rounds in quick succession. Some species need a little more stopping power.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The PEP laser will stun most humanoids.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And if it doesn't?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo simply tapped the Verpine under his jacket.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They waited. Maybe they really did look like a couple having a private moment. Randomly created people did strange things.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Staff in groups, ones, and twos began entering the building for the night shift.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Soon …</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Movement behind the transparisteel doors made him focus and check his chrono: 1155. <em class="calibre6">Staff sloping off early.</em> “Stand by,” he said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain turned very slowly away from him in her seat, ready to open the speeder's hatch and slide out.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ten or eleven workers emerged. Ordo and Etain slipped from the speeder and feigned ambling around in conversation. There was still frequent pedestrian traffic around the center.</div>

<div class="paragraph">By 0005 the trickle of staff in and out had slowed, and there was still no sign of Vinna Jiss.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“She has to come out that entrance.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're sure—oh, okay, Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They waited. He wondered how long the two of them would look inconspicuous.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then he spotted the ginger wavy hair and the beige tunic he'd seen earlier. <em class="calibre6">Jiss.</em> He watched her turn along the path and walk down the ramp toward the walkways that connected the complex to the business district around it; then he made his move.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain walked briskly at his side and grabbed his hand. “For goodness' sake, Ordo, try to look like a <em class="calibre6">couple.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo didn't much like that, but the mission came first.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They kept twenty meters behind Jiss, hampered by the lack of crowds of office workers to hide among at this time of night. Maybe they should have waited until daylight. But nobody knew how much time they might have to act. It was a case of <em class="calibre6">now.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain did that side-to-side head movement as if she was straining to hear something. “Okay … people behind us, but they seem to have their minds on matters other than us …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How do you know that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No feeling of focus on me, or you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Handy,” Ordo said, but he hitched back his jacket and hooked his thumb in his belt to be ready to grab the Verp.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had followed Jiss for about half a klick along the shrub-lined office walkways when the few pedestrians became none and they had no cover between her and them. Jiss turned right into a side alley and Ordo picked up speed, drawing his weapon and holding it as discreetly as he could against his chest.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where's she gone?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The alley,” Ordo hissed. “Are you blind?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I mean she's gone. <em class="calibre6">Gone.</em> I can't feel anybody there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo cocked the Verp and checked the status indicator. He might need that live round after all. He slowed at the corner and froze for a second before stepping into the opening with the gun raised, two-handed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was looking at a <em class="calibre6">man's</em> back about fifty meters ahead. <em class="calibre6">No sign of Jiss. Maybe that really is a Clawdite.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh my … ,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was about to discharge the lethal round into the containers of shrubbery and try for a tag pellet but the man appeared to crouch into a low run. There was a reflection, a split-second gleam that said <em class="calibre6">metal, alloy—weapon.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He fired instinctively.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The silent shot hit something with a wet <em class="calibre6">sssputt</em> and whoever or whatever he had hit rolled, stumbled, and raced off to the left down another passage. Ordo broke into a sprint, Etain pounding after him. He reached the point of impact and saw fluid—dark, oily—before discharging both tag pellets into the shrubs and lining up the next lethal round. This had gone wrong. <em class="calibre6">He</em> had got it wrong. But he couldn't turn back now: this had to be resolved. He swung left and there was someone lying on the paving, writhing, and he aimed the Verpine.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Check!”</em> Etain yelled. <em class="calibre6">“Check!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And in the fraction of a second that he froze on the safety command she had heard Skirata use, a shock wave of air and heat flared past him and hit the figure on the ground in a blinding, deafening flash. Without his visor he was stunned for a second, too. But he dropped on the body, holding the Verp clear, and grabbed an arm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Its limb melted away in his grip.</div>

<div class="paragraph">That second became endless, a layered image.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I'm going to throttle that Jedi.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">What the fierfek have I grabbed?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">It's a Clawdite.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He looked up at Etain but she raised her blaster again and spun around. There was a second deafening, blinding crack of a PEP laser discharging.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo had a tight grip of something very heavy and black and sleekly furred that had stopped moving. And that was an odd thing for a wounded Clawdite—a humanoid when not shapeshifting—to become.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A few meters from Etain, a human female lay crumpled on the paving, gasping for breath. It was Supervisor Wennen, <em class="calibre6">not</em> Jiss. Ordo defaulted to training and opened his comlink.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika?</em> We need extraction urgently. Two prisoners, both injured. <em class="calibre6">Now!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">His instinct told him to find some cover <em class="calibre6">fast.</em> The PEP laser would bring someone running before long. He dragged whatever creature he had shot into an alcove and motioned furiously at Etain to do the same with Wennen. It was amazing how heavy a weight a little Jedi could haul.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But he wanted to hit her, and hard.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre6">di'kut,”</em> he hissed. “I could have been killed. <em class="calibre6">Never</em> use that command. Do you hear me? <em class="calibre6">Never!</em> If you try that again, I'll shoot you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain's wide-eyed stare was either fury or shock. He didn't care.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought you were going to finish it off!” She knelt over the black creature at his side and put her hands on it. “It's <em class="calibre6">alive.</em> I have to keep it alive. You shouldn't have fired.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's my call to make.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You shot a Gurlanin—”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">There aren't any Gurlanins currently on Coruscant, so Zey says.</em> “Spare me your hindsight lecture.” <em class="calibre6">Gurlanin. Shape-shifter. Qiiluran. Spy. Never seen one before.</em> “Jusik, can you hear me? Can Vau handle shapeshifter first aid?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's voice was breathless. “With you in ten minutes, Ordo, hang on. Where's your speeder?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not here. Just <em class="calibre6">move</em> it, please.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had her fingers spread on the creature's black coat, her eyes shut tight. “I can use the Force to control the bleeding.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, you do that, Jedi.” He squatted over Wennen and checked her breathing with the Verp held to her head. “So, Supervisor, why were you following us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen looked in bad shape. Her eyes were streaming and she curled up into a ball, clutching her chest. Etain had fired the PEP laser at close range. “Republic … Audit … you shoot me, chum … and you're in big trouble …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Treasury officer?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Show me, or you're the one in trouble, ma'am.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She let out an anguished gasp and fumbled for her pocket. Ordo decided to play safe and extract the contents for her. Yes, it was an identichip: Republic Treasury Audit Division.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've nearly fouled up a GAR operation,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was following Jiss.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Supplies going missing. So did she. Who are you?” She pulled back her head a little to focus on his bare hand gripping the Verp. “Well, that tells me you're not Trooper Corr.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Obviously.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you the captain who came in the other day? Because you certainly recognize me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So much for deniability: this would be all over the Treasury in hours if he let her get up and walk away—not that she seemed able to. “We need to have a little chat.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And what's <em class="calibre6">that?”</em> Wennen tilted her head to look at the Gurlanin, lying inert while Etain struggled to stabilize its wound.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain opened her eyes a little.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This,” she said, “used to be one of our allies.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 0045 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata assembled a makeshift deployment tote board from three large sheets of flimsi and stuck them to the wall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was old technology, real words on real flimsi, not shifting lights and code. He needed its solid reassurance right now. Things were turning <em class="calibre6">osikla.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr—assigned to the team on Skirata's whim—stood beside him, dutifully listing target locations by numbers of visits and tagged suspects on one sheet while Skirata kept a tally of which commando was deployed, and where they all were for the next twelve standard hours. Without his armor and bodysuit, Corr was just a very young man with durasteel mechanisms where he should have had real hands, and it broke Skirata's heart.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Droid. They're making you into what they always thought you were, son.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata shook himself out of it and concentrated on the flimsi. He <em class="calibre6">hated</em> holocharts. He liked solid things that he could grab hold of, even if they had their limitations. It also kept his hands occupied when he was reaching the limits of his confidence. He had to stand firm. His men needed to see him in control, reassuring, believing in them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Believing in <em class="calibre6">them</em> was easy. He had doubts about himself. He glanced over his shoulder. “Is that thing dead yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kal'buir,</em> I'm sorry I got this wrong,” Ordo said. Somewhere, no matter how much reassurance Skirata gave him, he still seemed to fear that not being good enough meant a death sentence. Skirata hated Kaminoans with renewed passion. “I should have known what the creature was. I knew they existed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Son, <em class="calibre6">none</em> of us knew any of them were on Coruscant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">But they were. And that changed everything.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain and Jusik were kneeling on either side of the Gurlanin, hands flat on its flanks in some kind of Jedi healing process. Vau watched with interest. He was the anatomy expert, although he was more skilled at taking bodies apart than repairing them. Darman and Niner seemed unwilling to go back to sleep and joined the audience.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They'd become close to a Gurlanin on Qiilura. It must have been very hard to think of them now as possible agents for the Separatists.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a black-furred carnivore about a meter high at the shoulder, with long legs, four double-tipped fangs, and hard, unforgiving orange eyes. It now looked exactly what it was: a shapeshifting predator.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's recovering,” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good,” Vau said. “Because we want a chat with it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain looked up with that pinched expression she tended to adopt when she was angry in her rather righteous kind of way. “I lived alongside them. We promised we'd give them back their planet and so far all we've done is move in a garrison and train the human colonists to look after themselves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau stared slightly past her, straight-faced. “I believe that was you personally, General. You and Zey. And you were only following orders. That's it, isn't it? <em class="calibre6">Following orders.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Knock it off,” Skirata said. He didn't want Darman pitching in to defend Etain. Everyone's nerves were raw: tired, stressed people were dangerous, and they needed to be dangerous to the enemy, not each other. “Ordo, what are we going to do with Supervisor Wennen?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Besany Wennen was propped in a chair, arms folded gingerly across what must have been a very painful bruise to her whole chest. She was lucky that Etain's close-range PEP round hadn't killed her, but now the woman was just an extra complication they didn't need. Ordo was looking her over as if she was a new species.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And she <em class="calibre6">was.</em> There was a comfortable zone of attractiveness in females, and then there was a point beyond which it became too much. The very beautiful were intimidating and unwelcome. Wennen had passed that threshold, and Skirata was ambushed by his own unexpected hostility toward her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've probably guessed what we're doing, ma'am,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anti-terrorist operations?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Correct.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry. I had no idea.” But there was no screaming outrage or threats that <em class="calibre6">her</em> boss would rip the guts out of <em class="calibre6">their</em> boss, the usual response of bureaucrats. She just indicated the unconscious Gurlanin with a shaky hand. “Where does the Gurlanin fit into all this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Other than mimicking Jiss, we have no idea.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen seemed to be taking refuge in investigation, continuing to do her job even though she knew she was in a serious situation. Skirata respected that. “So if you two are Jedi, why didn't you spot the creature?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gurlanins can hide in the Force and shut us out,” Etain said. “When I first encountered them I even thought they <em class="calibre6">were</em> Jedi. They're telepathic, we can't detect them, we don’t know how many there are, and they appear to be able to mimic any species up to tall humanoid size.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Perfect spies,” Jusik said. “And perfect predators.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And we didn't honor our pledge to help them, so I suspect they've run out of patience.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, no disrespect to our Treasury colleague, boys and girls, but can we refrain from discussing classified intelligence in front of Agent Wennen?” Skirata said. “I need to talk to CSF. Corr, you call up the recce teams and see how far they've got on the main locations.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata wandered out onto the landing platform and breathed in cool night air. The strill was curled up under the bench where, true to his word, Vau had slept each night. He probably thought it proved the point that he was a hard case, but there was no doubt that he worshiped that stinking animal and it loved him.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Atin's going to take a knife to him when this is over. I know it. Well, worry about that when it happens…</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He raised his wrist comlink to his lips. “Jailer?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a pause and the sound of a woman grumbling and sheets rustling. Of course: Obrim had a wife and kids. Skirata often forgot that other people had lives beyond their jobs. “You know what time it is, Kal?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“To the second. Look, which of your people was on surveillance in the Bank of the Core Plaza?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a long, sleepy, irritable pause. “What, today? None of my people, I guarantee it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Organized Crime Unit?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I could ask, but they play these things close to their chests … getting to be an epidemic, this secrecy, isn't it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell you what,” Skirata said, dropping his voice. “Pay your OCU buddies a visit and tell them that anyone we see in our scopes who isn't <em class="calibre6">us</em> gets slotted as a matter of course, okay? You think they'll understand that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can but try.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Try <em class="calibre6">hard,</em> then. I don't want them crashing in like the <em class="calibre6">di'kutla</em> Treasury did tonight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Really?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah. An audit officer was sent in to monitor GAR staff siphoning off supplies. But that isn't my biggest problem right now.” <em class="calibre6">Don't mention the shapeshifter yet.</em> “Okay, here's my offer. I now have forty-three individual locations that we believe the Separatists are using or visiting in Galactic City. We have to concentrate on the high-value targets, and you really don't want to know what we'll be doing <em class="calibre6">there,</em> so what if we give you a list of the others to pick off as you see fit?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When we've recce'd the high-value ones and have an op order planned out—you know, precise timings. That way we don't fall over each other.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim had gone rather quiet. “I can authorize that. But I've got no control over the OCU.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then find someone who does. I mean it, Jailer. We're not playing by rules of evidence.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've <em class="calibre6">really</em> gone bandit, haven't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you really want to hear the answer to that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek … my eyesight problem has now affected my hearing, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought it might. I'm waiting on a meeting right now and after that, I'll have a list for you, a reliable one. Just remember that if there's any talk of explosives sales being of interest to CSF, tell them to steer clear until further notice?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll just say military intelligence and leave it at that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You go careful, friend. And those rather hasty boys of yours. Especially Fi.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata closed the link and went back into the main room. The Gurlanin was breathing more steadily, although its eyes were still closed and the two Jedi were still leaning over it. It was just as well they could stop the bleeding. There wasn't a medic on Coruscant who knew a thing about the physiology of a shapeshifter like <em class="calibre6">this</em> one.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And Wennen was watching the whole scene suspiciously. Okay, so she had a Treasury identichip. Skirata didn't trust anybody, because this leak of information was still very much an inside job. Until he knew otherwise, everyone except his assortment of clone soldiers—and the two Jedi, he conceded—was a potential risk.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ma'am,” he said. “I hear you don't approve of the war.” Civilians did odd things in the name of peace. “How much don't you approve of it? And why?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen chewed over the question visibly, and both Jusik and Etain flinched at something Skirata couldn't see. Wennen's expression changed to anguish. She stood up with some difficulty, and Skirata noted that Ordo's hand went unconsciously to his blaster.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This,” she said quietly, “is why I don't like the war.” She went up to Corr, who was still conscientiously collating data and writing it on the flimsi with an expression of intense frowning concentration. “Corr, show me your hands. Please?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The trooper put his stylus aside and held them out, metallic palms up. Corr placed her hands underneath so that his rested on hers for a moment and looked him straight in the eye. Single prosthetic hands—efficient, unnoticeable—were common; but to lose both hands seemed to pass beyond a threshold of what was flesh and blood.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not <em class="calibre6">right,”</em> she said. “It's not right that Corr and men like him should end up like this. I'm wondering what kind of government I'm working for. <em class="calibre6">One with a slave army,</em> that's what. You know how that makes me feel? Disgusted. Betrayed. <em class="calibre6">Angry.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata knew that feeling only too well. He just hadn't expected to hear it from someone who did an office job and could switch off HNE with its heroic and sanitized images of the war anytime she liked. Jusik caught his eye and nodded discreetly: <em class="calibre6">She really means it, she's upset.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata acknowledged Jusik with a slow blink. “You said it, ma'am.” <em class="calibre6">Got her. We have an ally. She'll come in useful one day.</em> “Believe me when I say that what we're doing here is aimed at stopping things like that happening to more lads like Corr.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen seemed satisfied, if someone that upset could reach that state of mind. She made her way back to the chair and handed Skirata her datapad. “Go on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't know what data might be of use to you, and you're not going to discuss detail with me. So take the datapad and copy what you like.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're very trusting. You're sure we're who we say we are?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Wennen laughed and stopped abruptly. That <em class="calibre6">had</em> to hurt her ribs. “Look, I know what I'm seeing. Now, if I'm out of contact for more than forty-eight hours, the Treasury will notice. So think about what you're going to do with me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata hefted the little 'pad in his hands. <em class="calibre6">Treasury data, codes, encryption algorithms. Oh, my Null boys will</em> love <em class="calibre6">slicing this.</em> “And who else is going to notice you're gone?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nobody. Absolutely nobody.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata pondered on that revelation for a while as he watched the unconscious Gurlanin. Jusik and Etain knelt back on their heels and looked as if they'd run a very tiring race.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It'll be regaining consciousness soon,” Etain said. “And I still have no idea how you restrain a shapeshifter.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo picked up one of the Verpine rifles, checked the charge level, and stood over the inert black body.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This does the job,” he said.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Recce team observation point, residential area, </strong><strong class="calibre11">business zone 6, 0110 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“I wish I hadn't eaten that hot sauce,” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Told you so.” Fi held out his hand for the infrared scope. “My turn.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They had found a spot to hide between two top-floor apartments facing the building they were watching, a six-floor tower of a house with closed blinds at every window. A climate-conditioning access space nearly at the top of their vantage point gave them an uninterrupted view below of a very quiet, very private group of homes away from the sky-lanes in a dead end.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The upper floors arched into a fashionable overhang only seven meters from the facing building. No passing traffic could enter from the front to bother them here, not even a taxi, and the rear access was nonexistent, which left only the roof for access by a small green speeder. It was private and a good place to defend—or get trapped. Fi rather liked the idea of the latter.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The access space felt like being in a drawer. They could just about crawl through it on all fours. Fi knew he wouldn't have enjoyed serving in a tank company at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Roll on your back for a while,” Fi said helpfully.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev hesitated then surrendered to the suggestion with a groan. “How many?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi tracked from right to left with the scope. “Well, I think we've got ten bodies in there, judging by the GPR image, and they've been in there for an hour now, and they're not moving around much. I call that an operational base. Agreed?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. Let's set up the remote holocam and get out of here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Given the layout of that place, it's going to be a bit busy slotting them all when we go in.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I like busy,” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Have Scorch and Fixer reported in yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev held his datapad level with his eyes. “Now, <em class="calibre6">that</em> sounds like fun.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What does?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Scorch says they've confirmed the third cluster is a small commercial docking area. CoruFresh fruit and vegetable distributors. Loads of spacegoing vessels of all sizes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, that's my idea of fun, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If we could get them all to meet up for a nice ride …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dream on. But we could certainly stop them from leaving in a hurry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi backed out of the space, pushing himself on his elbows with his DC-17 crooked in both arms, collecting more dust and dead insects on his bodysuit. He turned sideways on to a narrow shaft that opened into the building's plant maintenance room and dropped his left leg into the gap, searching for a foothold with his boot before finding the ledge and scrambling down to the floor. Sev simply rolled off and landed with a thud beside him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, where next?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi cocked his head. “Want to wander over and take a closer look at the roof? Evaluate it for rapid entry?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know how to engage my enthusiasm.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi projected the fire safety holoplans of the building, which had proved to be Ordo's best illicit data slice of the mission. There was no point asking the fire department to provide them; it just invited awkward questions about why lads in white armor wanted detailed floor plans of most of the planet's buildings. “I hope they update these. Okay, go left along the passage; the roof access is the set of doors at the end.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I love the fire department.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're so helpful. Nice uniforms, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They crawled across the flat roof along the side of the climate-conditioning machinery room, over lengths of durasteel ladder laid flat on the waterproofing. Some buildings still had them to provide access to maintenance spaces. There were also the remains of a barbecue. They flattened themselves behind the parapet to peer through the breaks in the punched durasteel at the roof opposite.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ooh, a Flash speeder,' Fi whispered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't even think about it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I meant that we could bolt on a few surprises, not wander off with it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, what does the word <em class="calibre6">recce</em> mean, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“It almost sounds like <em class="calibre6">wreck.</em>”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You scare me,” Sev said. “And that's saying something.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's an opportunity we might not get again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you fly, do you? Going to do a Jango?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've got no style.” Fi genuinely wanted to place a thermal detonator on the speeder. It could be set off remotely, giving them a relatively easy extra option for striking at the Seps that they might need soon. But he was also itching to smack Sev down a little. The man thought he was the galaxy's gift to adventure. So if he wanted adventure, Fi would show it to him, Omega-style.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It also just happened to be the safest way to cross the six-meter gap to the other roof—safer than asking the Seps across the way if they minded two commandos taking a look at their roof, anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi edged backward and began placing the sections of ladder end-to-end. They slotted together neatly. Then he crawled back to the parapet and gave the chasm an appraising glance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He peered across, then down six floors. “That'll reach.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I reckon.” Sev leaned over next to him. “So you're going to crawl across.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi took the end of the ladder and began to move it carefully to avoid loud scraping sounds. Sev took the other end and they balanced it lengthways on the parapet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I'm going to run.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, they say someone spiked my vat. But I reckon someone <em class="calibre6">really</em> spiked yours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Lost your nerve?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Di'kut.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I plummet heroically to my doom, then you can crawl across. Deal?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hate it when you try to provoke me into showing you how it's done.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like this?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had seconds. They needed to be across the gap and gone before anyone spotted them. He leaned down hard on one end of the ladder, lifting it enough to swing it out horizontally and drop the other end on the facing parapet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Thirty meters below, death waited. And if it wasn't death, it was paralysis.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He stepped up on the parapet, tested the first rung with his boot, and then focused straight ahead on the other side.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then he sprinted.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He still had no idea how his body calculated the gaps but he hit every rung and landed on the far side, dropping flat. When he knelt upright, Sev was staring at him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi beckoned. <em class="calibre6">Come on.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev ran for it. Fi broke his landing as he jumped off the parapet. He noted Sev's clenched jaw with satisfaction.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Easy,”</em> Fi mouthed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev gave him a hand signal, one of his especially eloquent gestures of disapproval.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The roof had a few steps down to doors that the holoplans showed as access to the top floor of the living area and the turbolift shaft. They didn't look that substantial in the flesh, but the plans appeared to be accurate: they didn't always get updated after renovations. A quick application of thermal tape on the doors and it would be easy to lob a few grenades down the hole to soften up the residents before going in. Fi gave Sev a thumbs-up and took a magnetic det out of his belt. It slid into place in the speeder's air intake with a faint <em class="calibre6">thack.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Back,</em> Fi gestured.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He teetered on the parapet and then ran across the durasteel rungs again, feeling them flex and spring back under his boots. When he looked back, Sev was lining up for the sprint, too. Fi beckoned encouragingly. Sev went for it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was two-thirds of the way across when he slipped. He grabbed for a rung and hung motionless from his right hand. Fi's gut somersaulted.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">If anyone looks up here now—</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Most people screamed when they fell. Sev, to his credit, was utterly silent. But his eyes were wide and scared. He tried to reach up with his left arm but for some reason didn't seem able to do it. Fi scrambled across the ladder on his belly and reached down to grab Sev's arm and haul him up. It was a potentially lethal maneuver on a narrow ladder, but Fi managed to get a grip on Sev's belt and pull him across the ladder crosswise.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev was using his right arm. It was only when Fi gripped his left shoulder to pull him in line with the ladder that he heard his sharp gasp and understood why he wasn't using that arm, and why he hadn't been able to lunge up to get a grip with his other hand. He'd hurt himself badly.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Udesii ... ,”</em> Fi whispered. “Take it easy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was pain, and there was whatever had happened to Sev. Fi dragged him back across the ladder a few centimeters at a time and rolled him onto the safety of the roof before hauling the ladder back in. When he dropped flat again, Sev was kneeling in a ball, clutching his left shoulder.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek, this is my fault for goading him. </em>“Can you walk?” Fi whispered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“ 'Course I can walk, you <em class="calibre6">di'kut.</em> It's my arm.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll let you drop next time, you ungrateful <em class="calibre6">chakaar”</em> Fi hauled him upright and decided to risk taking the service turbolift down to the ground level. By the time they reached the end of the walkway it was clear that Sev had dislocated his shoulder and had to hold the arm against his chest to tolerate the pain at all. He said nothing but it had made his eyes water. Fi had long used that phrase to indicate extreme pain but it was the first time he'd seen it up close, and it wasn't funny.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I miss this mission, I'm going to show you a really interesting trick with a vibroblade.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sev, take it easy.” Fi always kept his medpac on his belt. He fumbled for the single-use sharp of painkiller and stabbed it into Sev's triceps. “We'll slap some bacta on it back at base.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, and maybe that'll work when I rip your head off, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It was an accident.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It was a stupid stunt. I never had accidents with Delta.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, you're just Vau's perfect little soldier boys, then, aren't you? We screw up. And then we get up and go on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre6">have</em> to complete this mission?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not if you're a liability you don't. Look, injuries happen. Stay at base and monitor the comlinks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't understand.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Really?” Fi racked his brains for first-aid training. “Funny, I thought we did the same job. Look, get in here and let me have a look.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They slipped into the sheltered lobby of an office block and hid behind a pillar. Fi detached Sev's bodysuit sleeve from the shoulder seam and took a look in the dim security lights.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The line of the shoulder looked unnaturally square where the ball of the humerus had shifted out of the socket and was pushing the deltoid muscle up and out of shape. This was going to <em class="calibre6">hurt.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, on the count of four,” Fi said. He took Sev's wrist in his right hand, stretching out the arm, and braced his left hand against the man's chest. Then he paused and looked him in the eye in his most reassuring <em class="calibre6">I-know-what-I'm-doing way.</em> “See, when you get a dislocation like this, you have to do what they call <em class="calibre6">reducing it by—four'</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev yelped. The joint made a wet <em class="calibre6">shhhlick</em> sound as it slipped back into the socket.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em> Fi folded Sev's arm back against his chest and held it there while he struggled to get the sleeve section reattached. He could almost feel the torn ligaments and muscle fibers screaming. Sev's face was white, his lips compressed. “Nothing worse than bracing for it, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“For a moron, you're not a bad medic!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal said that if we could take a body apart, we ought to learn a bit more about putting it back together again if we needed to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, I <em class="calibre6">have</em> to be fit to fight.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, okay. Bacta and ice packs. Right as rain in no time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau'll kill me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, what is this thing with Vau?” Fi pulled Sev out into the walkway again, and they jogged back to the speeder they'd left a block away. “I know he had a reputation for beating the stuffing out of trainees, but why are you ready to gut Atin?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Atin's sworn he'll kill Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi almost stopped dead. “Atin? Old don't-interrupt-me-I'm-working-on-a-really-interesting-circuit? Our <em class="calibre6">At'ika?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Seriously?” Sev asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, sometimes I get serious. It happens?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. Atin's pod was the only one that ever lost men!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Geonosis. Ruined Vau's clean record?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not that simple. Atin was doing that survivor guilt thing when he got back, and Vau just <em class="calibre6">focused</em> him a bit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Odd: Skirata hadn't been around when Fi returned from Geonosis. But he'd worry about that later. “That explains the scar on his face.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You got it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Doesn't explain the rest of the scars he was showing you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You ask <em class="calibre6">him</em> about that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev was as near to scared as Fi had seen him. He couldn't imagine being afraid of Skirata. The man might have sworn himself to a standstill when he was angry, but nobody in Skirata's company ever felt they had to fear him. He was <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir:</em> he lavished ferocious care on his commandos to the exclusion of all else.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Sev didn't want Vau to know that he'd injured himself doing something reckless. Whatever the reason, Fi owed his brother some support.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, we don't mention the shoulder?” Fi started up the speeder. “We'll get it sorted ourselves. <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> can do that Force healing if the bacta doesn't do the trick. But Vau needn't know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">For the first time since he'd met the man, Sev softened visibly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, <em class="calibre6">ner vod,”</em> he said. “I owe you.”</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_20" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36422260" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36422261" class="calibre8"></a>17 <br class="calibre9"/>

<div class="paragraph">–Sergeant Kal Skirata to General Arligan Zey, on the nature of training</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 0115 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The Gurlanin opened its eyes, panting.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain couldn't tell one Gurlanin from another unless they allowed her to. They could shut out her Force-senses just as easily as they could reach out to her. She could detect nothing from the creature: no sense of identity, no emotion, and no purpose.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then the air around her came to life with a shuddering sense of past, of long memory, and of <em class="calibre6">betrayal.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Girl,” it said in a familiar liquid voice. “Can you do <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> right?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I … I know you,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Several of you know me.” The creature lifted its head and tried to rise, but sank back down again. “Darman, is Atin well?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek.” Darman edged forward and knelt down by the head of someone who had carried out vital intelligence work for the squad on Qiilura. Etain could see the pain on his face. Niner caught her eye and simply looked resigned, as if he expected everyone to betray them in the end. “Jinart?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. I expect we all look the same to clones.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman almost grinned but appeared to stop himself. “Atin's fine.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo cut in. “Just explain why you think killing my brothers is going to help Qiilura.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jinart focused wild orange eyes on Etain and struggled into a sitting position, flanks heaving. Etain could sense her fully now, bitter and determined, calling out to the void with her mind: she was probably reaching telepathically to her consort Valaqil, once General Zey's agent both on Coruscant and Qiilura. Skirata had his right arm across his body, almost but not completely casual, clearly ready to reach for his Verpine and take a shot if Jinart moved.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You think I am giving the Separatists information.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo stepped in and Darman got out of his way. “I'm inclined to think that anyone who bothers to shapeshift into Vinna Jiss might do that, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“She disappeared, like she often did. I simply adopted her form to move around unnoticed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“I</em> noticed. We'd already executed her.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then I made an error in taking her form.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Too right you did. Now, what's your problem with the Grand Army? Why not target politicians? You could walk in anywhere—even the Senate chamber itself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You assume too much. Are you one of the renegade clones that Zey so dreads?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's me,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I am <em class="calibre6">not</em> the one leaking information to the Separatists. And I am <em class="calibre6">not</em> targeting anyone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you still working for General Zey?” Etain asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. My people no longer serve the Republic—if we ever served you at all. We had an agreement. You broke it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We had an <em class="calibre6">agreement,</em> Jedi. You said you would give us back our world and stop the farmers from destroying us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In the middle of a war?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We <em class="calibre6">served</em> you in the middle of a war! When my people were dying of starvation, when our prey was being driven away by the colonists, we kept our bargain. And all you did—you, Jedi, you and Zey—was make them better able to fight and hold their land.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain didn't look at Darman. She didn't want to provoke him into defending her or—more probably—catch a hint that he might agree with Jinart.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She thought that all she had done was to ensure the farmers were a guerrrilla force able to resist the Separatists, but the native Gurlanins didn't see it that way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll root out the informants sooner or later,” Ordo said. “You can cooperate or not, but I might as well execute you now if you're not going to be useful. We can't handle any more prisoners.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was always hard to tell if Ordo was playing the interrogation game or simply stating his intentions. Judging by Skirata's quick glance at him, it was the latter. He motioned Etain to stand clear and charged up the Verpine.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can identify the informants for you,” Jinart said calmly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo simply held the muzzle to Jinart's head. Etain looked to Jusik, and then to Darman and Niner and Vau, but they were all simply watching impassively. Corr was engrossed in the holochart, still logging movements. Wennen sat in the chair, her hand to her brow as if shielding her eyes, but nobody was making any attempt to intervene. Etain's gut said it was <em class="calibre6">wrong.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">But she did nothing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're bargaining,” Ordo said. “I'll kill you anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're the one who needs to bargain. This isn't about my life.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Game's over.” Ordo held the Verpine steady. Etain waited, torn by indecision. She could stop Ordo for a fraction of a second—</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remove your forces and the colonists from my world and I will identify the Separatists for you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo—unblinking, passionless—lined the muzzle up about level where a normal animal's ear might be. “You haven’t told me <em class="calibre6">why</em> you were mimicking Jiss. That actually interests me more.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo, I'll deal,” Skirata said. “Stand down.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo simply raised the Verp and held it back against his shoulder without hesitation. Etain imagined he would need to be coaxed into withdrawing: she'd seen the potential violence swirling within him constantly. But he obeyed Skirata without murmur.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The sergeant prodded Jinart with his boot. “You tell <em class="calibre6">me,</em> then, shapeshifer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I observe,” Jinart said. “I watch to see when you move troops to and from Qiilura and how much you send to the farmers by way of aid to keep them loyal. All the things you never tell us, but that show your true intentions. I spy on you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let me explain something,” Skirata said. “I'm not the Republic. The work I do for them is actually for my own people—these lads here. So if you're not helping me keep my people alive, I'll make certain that Qiilura gets reduced to molten slag. And that's a promise. I'm not a Jedi and I'm not a politician, so I can do pretty well what I like. Your whole species is expendable. Understand?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jinart managed to get to her feet, or at least raise herself on her front legs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I will identify the people you want. But the Republic must agree to withdraw from Qiilura and remove the colonists within a year.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, let's get hold of Zey now,” Skirata said. “If he doesn't agree, we move on and I'm not letting you melt back into the city.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do you know how many of us there are, or <em class="calibre6">where</em> we are?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't care. Zey might.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My people are <em class="calibre6">here,</em> on Coruscant itself. You'll never track us down and we can be far more damaging than bombs.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Look, the logistics leaks are a sideshow right now. Save it for Zey.” Skirata opened his comlink. If the general was sleeping, then someone could go and wake him. War didn't keep office hours. “Supervisor Wennen, why don't you make us all some caf?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He expected some complaint, but none came. She stood up, still clutching her ribs, and made her way unsteadily to the kitchen area.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's Besany, Sergeant,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Yes, she's on our side. Result.</em> “Okay, I'm Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Who likes it sweetened?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All of us,” Skirata said. “Two big spoonfuls. It's going to be a long night.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 0200 hours. </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Darman sat cross-legged on the floor next to Jinart, hands clasped in his lap, as if he was watching her. Jinart watched him in return, orange eyes closing occasionally, her legs tucked under her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain sometimes had to look closely to see if Darman was just thinking or actually asleep, because the impression he was making in the Force was so ambiguous. When she knelt beside him to check, though, his eyes were closed. For a brief moment she wondered if Jinart could make telepathic contact with him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">His eyes opened. He glanced behind Etain and then brushed his lips against her cheek.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No word from Zey yet?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain shook her head. There was nothing to hide any longer and she rested her forehead against his, not caring what anyone else thought: it was impossible to hide their relationship in a tight-knit group of soldiers living in one another's pockets. “He's got to consult people. Even Zey can't make those decisions on his own.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You should have been a healer, you know. You're good at it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, let's see if I'm any good at healing rifts. I need to clear something up with Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Problem?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nothing to worry about.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain knelt back on her heels and stood up in one movement. Skirata was talking to Niner and Ordo by the flimsi sheets on the wall, cleaning his beloved Verpine gun with slow care while they discussed the concentration of Separatists in various locations on the brightly colored 3-D grid of the holochart.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She caught Skirata's eye and beckoned him to follow her. He inclined his head in mute agreement and laid the dismantled Verpine parts on the table beside him, where they sat wrapped in distorted lines of colored light from the holo-chart projection.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They walked onto the landing platform. The strill was asleep on its stomach, all six legs spread out like an ill-shaped furry insect.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I did something very foolish,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Again?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata looked stunned then balanced on the brink of anger. <em class="calibre6">“Ordo?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, nothing like <em class="calibre6">that …</em> I used a command that I heard you use. It upset him. I called <em class="calibre6">check</em> to stop him from killing Jinart outright. He told me why I should never use it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata blew out a long breath. “And you understand <em class="calibre6">now?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. I'm sorry. He … he said he'd shoot me if I ever did it again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He would. Don't ever doubt it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I believe you!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I never taught the Nulls that Jedi were their betters, you see, and I never taught them to obey the Republic, and no Kaminoan engineered them to be more cooperative than Jango. But they obey me for some reason, and even then I encourage them to question everything.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is he <em class="calibre6">programmed?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata looked at her with sudden disgust. Then he simply swung his fist at her without warning, a savage punch, a street brawler's punch. She leapt back and drew her lightsaber in one movement, but his fist went past her head. <em class="calibre6">Deliberately.</em> She could see the calculation on his face. She held her breath, waiting for him to lash out again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So are <em class="calibre6">you</em> programmed?” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The blue blade of energy thrummed as she brought the Lightsaber down from a raised position and then thumbed it off, feeling stupid and ashamed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was also shocked at Skirata's reflexes: he could have landed that punch, and he clearly wasn't afraid of her lightsaber skills. She would <em class="calibre6">never</em> take him for granted again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“You</em> should know better than anyone. You've been drilled in weapons handling from the same age that those boys were. Do you <em class="calibre6">think?</em> Or are you so well trained that your body just reacts”—he snapped his fingers—“like <em class="calibre6">that?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She had reacted all right. Her muscles remembered years of light-saber practice. Her Masters taught her to rely on instinct, on the Force, and <em class="calibre6">not</em> to think.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I said I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And so you should be. I taught <em class="calibre6">all</em> my boys that command from the very start. I drilled them over and over and over until they'd stop whatever they were doing <em class="calibre6">instantly.</em> And I did it for them, for times when it was needed to save <em class="calibre6">them</em> from something.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I swear I'll never do it again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo will never trust you now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But it only stopped him for a—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“—a fraction of a second that could <em class="calibre6">get him killed.</em> You just used him. Like all the <em class="calibre6">aruetiise</em> do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was furious: even in the dim light on the platform she could see that the skin of his neck was flushed, that telltale sign of strong reaction. In the last few weeks Etain sometimes felt that he saw her as the personification of the Republic, using his men for their own agenda, and that she was a handy target on which to vent his spleen. He didn't seem to view Jusik the same way, though.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Exploitation was a raw nerve in Skirata. Etain desperately wanted him to like her and make her feel like family, the way he did everyone else.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll apologize to Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, it really is him you need to make your peace with.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wondered why she hadn't realized that to start with. <em class="calibre6">Do I really see them as men? Do I regret angering Ordo, or do I just want to be Skirata's little girl?</em> She turned on her heel and decided to confront it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was having a tense conversation via his bead comlink, forefinger pressed to his ear. Jusik fiddled with some piece of circuitry, glancing up at him from time to time. The side of the conversation that Etain could hear suggested that someone on Zey's staff wasn't moving as fast as Ordo wished.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik mouthed <em class="calibre6">Captain Maze</em> at her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She waited. Ordo grunted. “I'll stand by.” He shook his head and turned to her. “What's wrong?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo, I owe you an apology. I was wrong to use the check command and you're right to be angry with me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He just nodded. It still surprised her that a man who was physically identical to Darman could somehow look so different.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I realize you had a bad deal, Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“On Kamino?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Even now, I think.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo blinked a couple of times as if she wasn't making sense. She had no idea where his mind ranged in those split seconds other than that he felt like a flurry of activity in the Force.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I didn't have a mother or a father, but a stranger willingly chose me to be his son. You had a mother and father, and they let strangers take you. No, General, don't pity me. <em class="calibre6">You're</em> the one who's had the worse deal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was shocking and it was <em class="calibre6">true.</em> The extraordinary clarity of his assessment hit her so hard that she almost gasped. It told her things she didn't want to know about herself. None of them changed her intentions. But she knew her motives better now, uncomfortable as they were.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She wondered if her real parents ever thought of her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She would never know.</div>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Withdraw from Qiilura? If that's what it takes to keep the Gurlanins from turning on us, it's a price we were going to pay anyway. We're too thinly stretched to maintain the garrison, and the Senate has no interest on continuing to support a mere two hundred thousand farmers on a backworld. Let me talk to Jinart and reassure her. The damage her people can do is enormous– far beyond the scope of one anti-terror operation. And we need them on our side.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–General Arligan Zey, to General Iri Camas and the chair of the Senate Committee on Refugees</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">The Kragget all-day restaurant, lower levels, Coruscant, </strong><strong class="calibre11">0755 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Jinartthe Gurlanin had kept her word and provided the information she had promised—and no more. Zey appeared to have kept his. The sleek black predator had slipped out into the Coruscant night and vanished.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Skirata would always feel that she was standing right next to him in some guise or another. Like the Jedi, her hypernatural abilities—especially telepathy—made him wary and suspicious.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But she could only sense the thoughts of her own kind, they said. <em class="calibre6">Like that's some kind of comfort.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata finished his eggs, rubbed his hand across his chin, and realized he needed to shave again. But things that had seemed crushingly impossible in the early hours of the morning looked a lot more encouraging on a full stomach in broad daylight.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gurlanins on the loose?” Jailer Obrim's voice was almost a groan. “That's all we need.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, that'll be one of the best-kept secrets of the war, I reckon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You believe them?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That they might be everywhere? You have to, Jailer. And I can't lose any sleep over a few Qiiluran farmers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They sat side by side, looking out toward the walkway through the Kragget's grimy transparisteel front. Neither of them were men who wanted to sit with their backs to any door. Obrim leaned in a little toward him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So do you want us to pick up the suspects the Gurlanin identified?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No thanks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is this where my eyesight and hearing fail again?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Right now, you can't even see me, let alone hear me,” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. Organized Crime Unit isn't happy, but they understand the words <em class="calibre6">armed special forces</em> really well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It <em class="calibre6">was</em> OCU in the plaza, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I gather so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How did they end up there?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your friend Qibbu uses well-worn channels of communications in the scum strata of society. OCU isn't stupid and it isn't deaf.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah.” <em class="calibre6">There is no monopoly of information.</em> Skirata's happily full stomach chilled a little. Obrim showed no signs of being smug. But he was almost certainly aware that Skirata was planning a sting operation involving explosives. “So they knew who the Seps were and didn't bother to—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. That wasn't the route.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They were carrying out surveillance on a known criminal and that criminal happened to meet up with one of the group that you were watching. Message boy, one chance encounter.” Obrim picked a chunk of smoked nerf from Skirata's plate and crunched on it thoughtfully “You just be careful. I hate finding friends on the slab in the morgue.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Apart from Jusik, Obrim was one of the few nonclones Skirata felt he might be able to trust completely one day. He was still undecided on Etain. While he didn't doubt her sincerity, she had an emotional, impulsive streak of the kind that got people killed.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Like you. You're a fine one to talk.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your boys okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tired, edgy, but giving it all they've got. One of 'em has sworn to gut Vau, another is having a love affair with a woman he shouldn't even look at, I'm collecting waifs and strays like an animal shelter, and we nearly killed a Treasury agent. But if I told you the <em class="calibre6">really</em> bad stuff, you'd think I had problems.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim laughed raucously. “And people think they're good little droids ...“</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Discipline apart, they're still lads.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Twi'lek waitress topped up their caf and smiled alluringly. “Where's your son today?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“At the office, sweetheart,” Skirata said. “Won't I do instead?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Her lekku coiled ever so slightly but he didn't have a clue what it meant. She glided away, glancing back to smile again. Obrim sniggered. “I see Ordo made an impression.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They all have this naive streak about them. It's fatally charming, apparently. Youth, muscle, heavy weapons, and a trusting expression. Maybe I should try it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Forty years too late.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then Skirata's communicator chirped. He lifted his wrist as close to his mouth as he could. Even in a restaurant full of police officers, he took few chances.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We like what we see,” said a voice with a Jabiimi accent.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was interesting how accents were more noticeable over a comlink. Skirata, still looking toward the walkway, scanned his field of view without moving his head. He was sure he hadn't been followed—but this was a bad place to be spotted if he had. “It's not noon yet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know, Kal. We're keen.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What next?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can you get to the bank plaza again in half an hour? I can't locate your comlink signal. But then I can understand why you're a <em class="calibre6">very</em> cautious man.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Too right, you</em> chakaar. Bard'ika <em class="calibre6">went to a lot of trouble to make me invisible.</em> Skirata was ten minutes by speeder bike from the plaza. “I can just about make it if I hurry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is just for a conversation. Be there, and don't bring anyone else.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The comlink went dead. Obrim chewed, silent, but his look said it all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reached in his pocket and put some credits on the table to cover the bill. “You're deaf <em class="calibre6">and</em> blind, remember?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim pushed the credits back at him. “You pick up the tab <em class="calibre6">next</em> time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was his good-luck ritual. Obrim seemed to hope that by saying it, he'd ensure there <em class="calibre6">was</em> a next time.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had every intention of making sure there would be.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Lower level, skylane 348, 0820 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata kept the speeder at a steady pace and looped back on himself a couple of times. There was no reason to expect anyone to be following him, but he assumed it anyway. The maneuver also padded out the ten-minute journey to a credible half hour.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">No point being too early.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">His ankle was agony today.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika,</em> how are you doing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's voice came over the comlink. “We've tracked a target moving to the plaza from the house that Fi and Sev recced. I think that confirms it's Perrive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But he won't come alone.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So that means he'll probably have minders nearby that we haven't tagged. New ones.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fine.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau's on his way,” Jusik said. “They won't recognize him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm already there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek. He <em class="calibre6">knows</em> you. Wait for orders—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Trust me, he won't see me at all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand down. Get out of there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I mean it. And I'm going off the comlink now, unless I hit real problems.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He shut the link, exasperated. But it was his own fault. You couldn't delegate that much to a kid and then expect him to read your mind and work out when he was supposed to wait for specific orders again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he was a Jedi, after all. He could take care of himself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata pushed a bead comlink into his ear and brought the speeder down in the public parking area. Enacca said she was fed up collecting abandoned speeders from around the city, and wanted to know why they couldn't bring their vessels and vehicles back with them every time. The logistics of operations like this depended on a lot of grim drudgery. He'd have to sweeten her up somehow when all this was over.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Out in the plaza, by the bench where he had awaited the Separatists the day before, stood Perrive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was busy looking like an executive waiting for a colleague: suit, document case, polished shoes. Skirata walked up to the man as briskly as he could with a complaining ankle.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, what's the deal?” Skirata said. He tried to focus on Perrive and not look over his shoulder for possible threats or—to be precise—Walon Vau. “I can get you the dets in twenty-four hours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's discuss this somewhere less crowded.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Those were often the worst words to hear at times like this. “Where?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Follow me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek.</em> He hoped Vau was watching him or Jusik was monitoring the conversation carefully. If Perrive moved too far out of the comlink's limited mike range, he'd have to make stupidly obvious comments to clue them in. Perrive didn't strike him as quite that naive, even if his surveillance team was some way short of professional.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If Vau was here, Skirata couldn't see him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But that was the point, and Vau was a very skilled operator.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata followed Perrive across the plaza and back to the speeder parking area, a few moments that made him glad that he had a limp. It gave Vau, he hoped, a little more time to work out what was happening. Perrive stood looking around, and a shiny new green speeder with a closed cabin rose from below the level of the parking platform and maneuvered sideways to set down.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Ah well,</em> Skirata thought. <em class="calibre6">I’d have done the same. But Perrives lungs are coated with marker Dust, and Jusik can track this crate all the way.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Off you go,” Perrive said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're not coming, too?” <em class="calibre6">Oh no, no, no. Why didn't I dose myself with some of that</em> di'kutla <em class="calibre6">Dust?</em> “Forgive me if I get nervous about the quality of your associates' driving.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't worry. All they'll do is blindfold you. Keep whatever weapons I'm sure you're carrying. I'll see you at our destination.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had no choice but to get in. Two human males—both about thirty, one shaven-headed, one with thin blond hair scraped back in a tail, neither of them the hired help they had tagged yesterday—sat in the front seat, and the bald one leaned over to place a black fabric bag over his head in total silence. Skirata folded his arms to feel the comfort of his assorted hardware in his sleeve, holster, and belt.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, this is fun,” he said, hoping for a display of verbal stupidity that might help Jusik locate him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But neither man responded. He didn't expect them to.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Concentrate on the movement. Work out the direction.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata tried to count the number of times they seemed to swing right or left to get some idea of the route. They were in an automated skylane, so he could count the seconds and try to calculate the distance between turns, but it was a massive task. Ordo, with his faultless memory, would have had the skylane network memorized and calculated the times and distances at the same time. But Skirata was not a Null ARC trooper, just a smart and experienced soldier whose natural intelligence had been sharpened by having to cope with six hyperintelligent small boys.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had no idea where he was. The speeder continued toward either a nerve-racking deal that would take them a step closer to striking at the heart of this Separatist network, or a lonely death.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Service tunnel beneath skylane 348, 0855 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika,</em> you'll never need to shave again when Kal catches you,” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You seriously think I'm not going to follow him?” Jusik raced Ordo's Aratech speeder bike along the service tunnel that ran parallel to the skylane serving the southern edge of the plaza. Fi decided that Ordo had no sense of danger if he was happy to ride pillion with the Jedi at speeds approaching five hundred kph. But then the man was nuts anyway. Fi held on to the handgrip behind him for grim death. “Vau, can you still hear me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The comlink was breaking up, but audible. “I'm a few vehicles behind Perrive. He's transmitting like a Fleet beacon.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where's he heading?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Looks like Quadrant N-Oh-Nine.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's there besides offices and residential?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's about it. Stand by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik made an irritated grunt that he seemed to have picked up from Sev and accelerated. At times like this Fi had passed beyond the first flush of adrenaline and into a cold and rational world where everything made sense to his body if not to his brain. He found an instinctive sense of effortless balance as Jusik wove through the ducts, clearing some of the transverse durasteel joists by a breath. Speed no longer felt like conscious fun, as it had in training, but he was beyond fear for himself at that moment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">All he could think of was Sergeant Kal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He can take care of himself,” Jusik said. “He's packing more weapons than the Galactic Marines.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you telepathic?” The thought disturbed Fi, because his mind was the only private retreat he had. “I was just—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you're not as worried for him as I am, then I've read you all wrong, my friend.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes? Too fast? Look—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Even if you didn't have your Force powers, you'd still be a terrific soldier. And a good man.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi couldn't see the Jedi's expression. For once, Jusik didn't scare the living daylights out of Fi and look back over his shoulder with a silly grin when they were hurtling toward a wall, only to bank sharply at the last moment. Jusik dropped his head for a second and then raised it again. His slipstreamed hair slapped Fi in the face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll try to live up to that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, but you still need to get your <em class="calibre6">shabla</em> hair cut.” Jusik didn't laugh. Fi wasn't sure if he was moved or offended. And it seemed impossible to offend Jusik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Hang on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Whatever element of the Force was guiding the Jedi, it was completely instinctive. He could find Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The speeder swung hard left and Fi feared for the Verpine rifle under his jacket, its folded stock wedged in his armpit. He was used to wearing the scruffy assortment of dull civilian clothing that Enacca had sent over with Vau. He wondered how he'd cope with his all-encompassing Katarn armor after being out of it for two weeks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's head jerked around as if someone had summoned him. “He's heading for business zone six.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Been there. Recce'd that place last night. Stuck a remote holocam opposite the house, in fact.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Maybe the Force is giving us a break.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's <em class="calibre6">got</em> to be their hub.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's try that.” Jusik banked right to shoot up a vertical channel. Fi decided zero-g had its appeal. “At least we'll be able to see Kal if that's where they're heading. I bet that's reassuring.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It would be.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But if they're using the speeder that was parked in their roof space last night, I clamped a remote thermal detonator in its air intake.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just remote? Not timed?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's okay then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">If—when—they got Skirata back in one piece, Fi would tell him. He had a sense of humor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's somebody following him,” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah. You, me, Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, not us.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Escort for the speeder?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, nothing like that at all. Someone else. I don't get any sense of malice. But it's not the strike team.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's that feel like?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like someone standing behind me.” He took one hand off the steering and tapped the back of his head behind his ear. The speeder swerved. “Right <em class="calibre6">there.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Both hands, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika …”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry. Whoever it is, they're focused on Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Should we be worried?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik twisted the handlebars and the speeder accelerated <em class="calibre6">as</em> if it had been fired from a Verpine. Fi bit his lip and couldn't stop his knees from pressing harder into the speeder bike's fuselage.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If he dropped the precious sniper rifle, Skirata would be heartbroken.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's all right, then,” Fi said. “I won't worry at all.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Residential area, business zone 6, 0930 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The airspeeder settled, hot alloy clicking as its drive cooled, and someone pulled the black hood off Skirata's head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This way,” said the shaven-headed man. “Mind the steps!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata walked down from a rooftop parking area through doors to a tastefully decorated room with a large, grainless pale wood table and thick deep gray carpet. They weren't short of credits, then. Some terrorism was the war of the dispossessed, and some was the handiwork of the rich who felt secondhand outrage. Either way, it was an expensive sport.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He was a mercenary. He knew the price of everything.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He sat down in the chair offered, elbows braced on the table, and tried to take in as much useful detail of his surroundings as he could. <em class="calibre6">Two visible escape mutes: back out those doors, or down the turbolift.</em> After ten minutes, a middle-aged human male entered with a woman of similar age: there was nothing remarkable about either of them. They simply nodded to Skirata and sat down facing him. Four more men followed, one of them about Jusik's age, and Skirata found himself surrounded at the table by six people.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Perrive walked in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll excuse us for not introducing ourselves, Kal,” he said. “I know you and you know me, and that's probably all you need to know?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Apart from the bank details, yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive stood by the chair opposite Skirata and glanced pointedly at the man sitting in it, who then moved to another chair. <em class="calibre6">You're definitely the boss, then.</em> And the others around the table—who were obviously assessing him as a supplier didn't look like junior minions. This was either the terror cabinet or a rare gathering of cell leaders. It had to be. Perrive handed the man next to him the small sample pack that Skirata had supplied the day before, and he examined it carefully before passing it around the table.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Yes, they’ll be the ones distributing this. I should blow this place now. But that's not sensible. Just satisfying.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'd like all hundred kilos of your goods and four thousand detonators?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata did a quick calculation. About twenty-five grams of five-hundred-grade thermal per device, then: a Bravo Eight Depot incident took the equivalent of two of those. Enough bomb-making kit for that level of carnage every day for five years, or a lower body count and mutilation for more than ten. A very economical war.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How much?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Two million credits?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't even pause to think. “Five.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Two.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Five.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Three.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Five, or I need to go and talk to my other customers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't have any others who want <em class="calibre6">this</em> kind of explosive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you think that, then you're new in this galaxy, son.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Three million credits. Take it or leave it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata got up and really did intend to walk. He had to look as if he meant it. He skirted the table as far as Perrive and then the man turned and put his hand on Skirata's right arm. Skirata jerked it back, and he wasn't acting the jumpy mercenary. It was his knife arm. Perrive noticed, eyebrows raised for a fraction of a second.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Four million,” Perrive said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused and chewed the inside of his cheek. “Four, credits to be deposited and confirmed as being in my account before I release the goods, and I want the deal done in the next forty-eight hours.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That requires trust.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I don't have any other customers, then why would I want a hundred kilos of explosives hanging around my premises until Mustafar freezes over?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive paused and then almost smiled. “Agreed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reached in his pocket and handed him a datachip, stripped of all information except a numbered account that would exist only from noon for forty-eight hours. He had a constant stream of accounts like that. All the Nulls could slice like top pros, but Jaing was an artist among data deceivers. <em class="calibre6">My clever lad.</em> “Time and place, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All in one delivery.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. But it stays wrapped in quarter-kilo packs bagged in tens, because I'm not going to unwrap every <em class="calibre6">di'kutla</em> bar and get covered in forensic evidence.” He paused, trying to look as if he was thinking of another reason. “And that's two and a half kilos a bag, which is going to be easier for you to move.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What makes you think we're going to move it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Smart, eh?</em> “If you're keeping that all in one place, you're insane. I'm used to handling the stuff and even <em class="calibre6">I</em> don't like it around me. You do know what five-hundred-grade does, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course I do,” Perrive said. “It's my business. Let's say midnight tomorrow. Here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I knew where <em class="calibre6">here</em> was, I might agree.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll let you walk out and then you'll see.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can land speeders on your roof, can I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Up to Metrocab size.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll probably bring two small speeders. I'll call you half an hour before.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I haven't given you my number.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Better do that, then, or you won't get your goods. I don't want any further contact until then—and I don't want anyone following me when I leave here. Okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive nodded. “Agreed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And it was that simple. It never ceased to amaze Skirata how much simpler it was to buy and sell death than it was to pay taxes. “Show me to the front door, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Shaven-Head took him down in the polished durasteel turbolift—it always reminded him of Kamino, that brutally clinical finish—and walked him through a ground floor that was just one square room with no rear exit and one door at the front.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Easier to defend—if you were confident you could escape via the roof.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The doors parted. Kal Skirata stepped out onto a secluded walkway and found himself in affluent Coruscanti suburbia. He checked the position of the sun and began walking in the direction of the main skylanes. If he kept walking east, he'd come to the office sector sooner or later. Besides, the holo-cam that Fi and Sev placed a few hours earlier was watching him right now from the building opposite.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There were a lot of pedestrians about.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata clicked his back teeth and opened the comlink channel. He didn't like the bead comlink any better than he liked wearing a hearing enhancer.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Listen up, <em class="calibre6">ad'ike,”</em> he said as quietly as he could. “Game on. <em class="calibre6">Game on!”</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Logistics center, Grand Army of the Republic, Coruscant </strong><strong class="calibre11">Command HQ, 0940 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Do I look as if I've been flattened by a … <em class="calibre6">PIP</em> laser?” Besany Wennen asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“PEP</em> laser.” Ordo, posing as Corr again, helmet tucked under his left arm, let her pass through the logistics center's doors ahead of him as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> had told him. It was the polite thing to do. “And no. You just look tired.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can't say it's been a typical day's duty for me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I respect your willingness to accept this without wanting to complain to your superiors.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I did, I'd compromise your mission, wouldn't I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Possibly.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then it's just a bad bruise and an interesting evening. No more.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was as tall as he was and looked him straight in the eye: her dark eyes made her light blond hair seem exotic in contrast. <em class="calibre6">She's different. She's special.</em> He made a conscious effort to concentrate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll make sure you have acceptable records for your bosses to show that the investigation was completed,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And that the suspects … let's say that I learned they were of interest to military intelligence, so I withdrew from further involvement?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I can guarantee they won't be troubling you any longer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was still waiting for her to ask exactly what Vau had done to the real Vinna Jiss, and what Ordo was going to do to the employees leaking information—Jinart had identified two—and a thousand other questions. He would have wanted to know <em class="calibre6">everything,</em> but Wennen just stuck to what she needed to know to close down her part of the surveillance. He didn't understand that reaction at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What happens to you now?” he asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I go back to my own department in the morning and pick up the next file. Probably corporate tax evasion.” She slowed him down with a careful hand on his arm. He let that touch thrill him now. He was still uneasy, but he was less disturbed by the attraction. “What about you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Reducing payroll numbers. Fi suggested we call it <em class="calibre6">staff turnover,</em> in the spirit of military euphemism.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It seemed to take her a couple of moments to work out what he meant. She frowned slightly. “Won't whoever they're reporting to notice they're missing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Jinart says they only call in every four or five days. That gives us a time window to work within.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Aren't you ever afraid?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“When the shooting starts, frequently.” It struck him that she probably found the idea of assassination uncomfortable, but she didn't say so. “But not as afraid as I would be if I were operating without weapons. Your superiors really should arm you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They reached the doors to the operations room. She stopped dead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know this has nothing to do with me any longer, but will you do something for me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want to know when you make it through this.” She seemed to lose some composure. “And your brothers, and your ferocious little sergeant, of course. I rather like him. Will you call me? I don't need details. Just a word to let me know that it went okay, whatever <em class="calibre6">it</em> is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think we can manage that,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">This was where he turned left to go to Accounts, to find Hela Madiry, a woman clerk nearing retirement age—just an ordinary woman who happened to have distant cousins on Jabiim. Then he would pay a visit to Transport Maintenance, and look up a young man who had no family allegiance or ideology in this war but who liked the credits that the Separatists paid him. Their motives made no difference: they would both die very soon.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Be careful … Trooper Corr,” Besany said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo touched gloved fingers to his forehead in an informal salute.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You too, ma'am. You too.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Business zone 6, walkway 10 at the junction of skylane 348, </strong><strong class="calibre11">0950 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Fi braced for a verbal barrage as Jusik brought the speeder to a stop at the end of the walkway and settled it on the edge of the taxi platform. Skirata walked up to them straight-faced through the scattering of pedestrians and stood with his hands thrust in the pockets of his leather jacket.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're leading Fi astray, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry, but you told me that you should never enter an enemy stronghold without backup if you could help it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hate it when people take notice of me. Fi, what's wrong?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was still looking around, trying to cover three dimensions that might conceal a threat. Jusik had said that whoever was following Skirata had no malicious intention, but Fi reasoned that not everyone who was going to kill you had a sense of malice. He'd killed plenty of people without any ill feeling whatsoever. While the Force was fascinating, Fi liked to see things through the scope of his Deece, preferably with the red target acquisition icon pulsing.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He put his hand under his jacket to slide the rifle from under his arm. This was when the unusually short barrel and folding stock came into their own. You could still use the weapon at short range. <em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika</em> thinks there's someone following you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I normally notice!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you're deaf.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Partially,</em> you cheeky <em class="calibre6">dilcut.”</em> Skirata resorted to his reflex of straightening his right arm to have his knife ready. “Well, maybe we'd better move on before they catch up?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nobody with ill intent,” Jusik said. He slid his hand to the opening of his jacket, suddenly edgy. Fi took his cue and swung off the speeder to stand in front of Skirata. “And they're very, very close.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Steady, son. Public place, people around. No lightsaber, okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Very</em> close.” Jusik looked past Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A young man with short white-blond hair was striding toward them through the sparse crowd, arms held a little away from his sides, a large bag over one shoulder. His knee-length dark blue coat was wide open. But that didn't mean he wasn't carrying an armory under there somewhere. Fi unfolded the Verp's stock one-handed under his jacket and prepared to draw it and fire.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The man then held both hands up at shoulder level and grinned.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” Skirata breathed. <em class="calibre6">“Udesii,</em> lads. It's okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The blond man—Fi's height, very athletic—walked straight up to Skirata and crushed him in an enthusiastic hug. <em class="calibre6">“Su'cuy, Buir!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Father.</em> Fi knew the voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Suc'uy, ad'ika. Tion vaii gar ru'cuyi?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“N'oya'kari gihaal, Buir”</em> The man looked almost tearful: his pale blue eyes were brimming. He wiped them with the heel of his hand. “If I'm not careful I'll wash out this iris dye.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That hair doesn't suit you, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can change that, too. I've got lots of different colors. Did you like what I added to the five-hundred-grade thermal?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah. I did wonder.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm still a better chemist than <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika, Kal'buir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi finally saw the face in front of him as a negative image, and suddenly imagined dark hair and eyes, and realized why the man was familiar. He wasn't one of Skirata's own sons. He was a clone, just like Fi: or, to be precise, just like Ordo. It was astonishing how much difference pigmentation alone made to someone's appearance: a simple but effective disguise, for casual use anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata beamed at him with evident pride. “Lads, this is ARC Trooper Lieutenant N-7,” he said. “My boy Mereel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">So this was Mereel. And even though Fi's <em class="calibre6">Mando'a</em> wasn't perfect, he understood that Skirata had asked him where he'd been, and that the ARC trooper had said that he'd been hunting fish-meal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi was fascinated. But he kept his fascination to himself.</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_22" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36424191" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36424192" class="calibre8"></a>19 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I had no mother and no father. I was four years old when they first put a weapon in my hands. I was taught to suppress my feelings, and to respect and obey my Masters. I was encouraged to be obsessive about perfection.

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">GAR logistics center, 1230 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">It was lunchtime.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The biggest decision most people made at that time of day in the logistics center was whether to eat in the cafeteria or find a spot in the public courtyard nearby to enjoy an open-air snack.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo's decision was whether to use the Verpine, or walk up to the traitor Hela Madiry, maneuver her into a shadowy alcove, and then garrote her or cut her throat.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Verpine. Best choice.</em> Fast and silent, as long as the projectile didn't pass through her and hit something that made a noise.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Madiry sat in the shadow of a planter filled with vivid yellow shrubs, eating a mealbread stick and reading a holozine, oblivious to her life expectancy. Ordo sat in the shade of a manicured tree with his datapad on his lap, calculating her remaining life in minutes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was nobody within ten meters of her, but there <em class="calibre6">was</em> a security holocam.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A man sat down on the bench beside him. “Well, our young friend in Transport Maintenance just had an unfortunate accident with a repulsorlift platform. Thanks for the use of your security codes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And he didn't turn into a Gurlanin, I hope.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel looked utterly alien with light hair and eyes. Even his skin was tinted two shades paler. It didn't suit him. “No, <em class="calibre6">vod'ika,</em> he turned into a dead human. Skulls and repulsorlifts don't mix. Trust me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just checking.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You haven't told <em class="calibre6">Kal'huir</em> about Ko Sai yet, have you?” Mereel asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought he might be less distracted if we wait until this mission is completed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's a true <em class="calibre6">verd,</em> a warrior. He's never distracted when the shooting starts.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“There's no rush,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel shrugged. Out of armor and <em class="calibre6">kama,</em> he slouched in a convincingly civilian manner. “So, shall I wander off?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was watching the security holocam that covered the area between the woman and the public refreshers twenty meters beyond. “Can you disrupt that holocam circuit for me on my mark?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel felt in his coat for something and pulled out a slim stylus. It was an EMP disruptor. “I can do it without leaving my seat, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, I'll give you a reminder to kill the cam when I'm five meters from her.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel tapped his ear. “Comlink on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took a few slows breaths. He had removed the folding stock from the Verpine rifle; it was now short enough to conceal under a document holder. He looked like any other anonymous, helmeted, convalescing clone trooper playing office boy and carting archived flimsi around.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre6">Go</em>,” Ordo said, and stood up.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He walked toward the refreshers, which took him on a path past the Madiry woman.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mereel, kill the cam.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He had a few moments now before a security console spotted the outtage and tried to fix it. He took five fast strides and bent over Madiry as if to ask her a question.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She looked up as if an old friend had startled her. “Hello, trooper.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Hello, <em class="calibre6">aruetii,”</em> Ordo said. He drew the Verp and put two rounds point-blank through her forehead and a third down at an angle through her upper chest. One round thudded through into the planter of soil behind her. Ordo had no idea where the other two went, but the informant was now dead and she simply slumped, head down as if still reading, a pool of her bright blood on the holozine's screen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo slipped the Verp back under the document folder and walked away. It had taken less than ten seconds from cuing Mereel to walking away.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Nobody even looked at him as he strode calmly toward the GAR complex, passed it, and met Mereel on the other side of the speeder parking bays. They disappeared into the sea of vehicles and mounted the Aratech speeder bike to head back to base.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> had always told the Nulls they were instant death on legs. Ordo liked to live up to that assessment. His thoughts were on Besany Wennen as he rode off, and how it was good that he hadn't had to kill her, too.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The more the tagged targets moved around Coruscant, the clearer the strike team's task became.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That,” Fi said admiringly, “gets better every time I look at it, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik stared at the Coruscant holochart with a big grin and basked in the approval. The telltale red traces of the marked terrorists as they moved around the city were forming a pattern that firsthand surveillance would have struggled to build up.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It was obvious, really,” he said. “You'd have come up with it yourselves sooner or later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau put down a bowl of milk in front of the strill. It lapped noisily, showering droplets across the carpet. “I vote that Dust-tagging becomes standard surveillance procedure. It's a matter for your sergeant, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The police interloper's trace had been removed. Jailer Obrim had given her a painless and unnoticeable EMP sweep to kill transmissions from the marker powder she had inhaled. Now just five marked targets moved around the grids of blue light, building an accurate picture of where they went and where they stayed. The division between the two was now very much easier to see. Four locations—the house in banking sector 9, the landing strip used by the fresh farm produce importers, and two apartments in the retail sector—were clearly the most visited.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But we probably only tagged Perrive's hired help,” Fi said. “We want the bigger guys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The bigger guys,” Vau said, “need the hired help by their side. All this activity is connected to the fact that they're about to receive explosives they badly need. Now, we know they used dead letter drops, for want of a better phrase, to avoid direct contact between the various terror cells in the network. It's how they ensure there's no way of tracing them back. So what does this tell you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi studied the hypnotic blue and red light in front of him. “They're moving back and forth between locations over and over.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And therefore?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Therefore … they're either one cell … or they're several cells who have abandoned security precautions and are making direct contact with each other.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well done, Fi.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi didn't care for Vau but he enjoyed praise. He savored the moment. “So what do you think we've got here?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Given that this centered on the explosives, I think we're looking at the manufacturing cell—the people who make the bombs. Possibly also the ones who place them. Setting a complex device in a location or on a vessel can be a fiddly business, and I reckon this lot would do it themselves. They need to be mobile to get to different target locations, too, hence the need for a busy landing strip—nobody notices more traffic movement there. Now, Fi, <em class="calibre6">that's</em> a group of people worth taking out. Those are hard skills to replace in a hurry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik gave Fi a playful punch on the shoulder, elated. “Result!” He seemed to see it as a big puzzle to be taken apart. If Fi hadn't seen Jusik use a lightsaber, he would have taken him for a boy who just liked playing with complicated kit. “Time to make their eyes water, eh, Fi?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You got it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta has recce'd the landing strip. You've reece'd the house in the banking sector. That just leaves the two apartments, and Ordo and Mereel have stopped off to recce those now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill had finished its milk, most of which had ended up on the carpet. Vau—a sergeant who believed in thrashing courage into his men, a sergeant who had scarred Atin badly—grabbed a cloth from the kitchen area and mopped up the damp patches. Then he took a clean rag, soaked it, and wiped the strill's mouth and jowls as if it were a baby. The animal accepted the indignity and rumbled with happiness.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi wasn't sure he would ever know what went on in the heads of nonclones.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Delta and Omega assembled in the main room, finding seats where they could, and spent the next hour planning three house assaults and a raid on an airstrip. They were basic maneuvers they had drilled for time and again on Kamino; they'd done it for real more than once, too. They had fairly recent plans of the buildings—not to be relied upon absolutely, of course—and covert holocam surveillance. Apart from the fact that the squads were used to operating alone, it was as near a done deal as an operation could be.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Planning. It was all about <em class="calibre6">planning.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">But there was always a surprise, always one more factor you hadn't allowed for or didn't see.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi planned for that, too. They all did, deep down.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's Hut, 1530 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Etain knew.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She had known it would happen in time, but it had happened <em class="calibre6">now,</em> in two brief, wonderful weeks. The Force landscape that surrounded her had changed subtly and she felt strangeness and purpose within her, purpose that was <em class="calibre6">someone else's.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was said that Force-sensitive females could often detect the moment that they conceived. And it was true.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain stood on the landing platform for a while, searching for the fear she always imagined might come with taking that irrevocable step and not knowing its full consequences. But there was no fear. There was simply a pleasant sensation of certainty, almost like hands pressing on her shoulders.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And a clear vision, in the part of her brain that saw the universe without images, showed a new path through trails of webbed, colored light. In her prosaic way, it reminded her of a holochart, but it was less solid, its threads and lines shifting.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The new path that was marked through the tangle of colored threads was pale, silver, and thick, and from it sprouted silver tendrils that snaked into the tangles of the rest of the image. This new life she carried would be significant, and it would touch many others. The Force was clear if you listened carefully to it: and this time it said <em class="calibre6">This is not wrong.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">On Qiilura, I envied Jinart her certainty. I envied Master Fuller that quality, too. And now I have it at last.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was almost blissful. She savored the warm sun on her face, eyes closed for a few moments, and then walked back into the main room. It seemed oddly empty: Delta and Omega were catching up on sleep, doors shut. Ordo had disappeared with Mereel, and Corr had left a datapad running to log movements of suspects on the holochart while he went for a meal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau stretched out in one chair with the strill on his lap while Skirata sat opposite him, boots up on the low table, eyes closed, hands clasped on his chest. Etain watched him, knowing that she might need to tell him even before she told Darman: she would need Skirata's help, his list of contacts and places to disappear.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman would be overwhelmed by it all when he needed to keep his mind on fighting. But Skirata was a man of the world, never fazed by anything; he would understand what she was giving Darman, and want to help.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Not yet, though.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">While she watched Skirata, Niner wandered out of his room in his red fatigues, scratching his head with both hands. He poured a glass of water and walked across the room in slow silence to stand contemplating the sleeping Skirata with a slight frown. Then he went back to his room. He emerged a few moments later with a blanket and eased it over his sergeant, tucking it around him carefully. For once the man didn't stir.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner stood over him for a while, simply looking down at his face, lost in thought.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's okay,” Etain whispered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just checking,” Niner said quietly, and returned to his room.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain defocused for a few moments and sought Darman in the Force: as ever, he was a well of calm and certainty, even while sleeping. When she focused on the room again, she realized Skirata had opened his eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You okay, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika?”</em> he said. “Was that Niner just now?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm fine.” He <em class="calibre6">was</em> in a better mood now. Perhaps he regarded the matter between her and Ordo as closed. “Yes. He was checking on you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's a good lad. But he ought to be getting some sleep.” He raked his hair with his fingers, yawning. “Fatigue affects your judgment.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But not yours,” Vau said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was alert in a heartbeat and swung his legs off the table onto the floor. Vau could wind him up as surely as a mechanical toy. “If I don't move fast enough when the shooting starts, that's my problem. I'm used to it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, we all know.” Vau turned to Etain. “This is normally where he starts lecturing me on his ghastly childhood as a starving war orphan living feral on some bomb site, and how I just ran away to become a mercenary because I was bored with my idle, rich family.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that saved me some time,” Skirata said irritably. “What he said.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You have a family, Vau?” Etain was suddenly mesmerized by people who had lives and parents. “Are you in contact with them?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. They cut me off when I declined to choose the career they wanted for me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Wife? Children?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dear girl, we're <em class="calibre6">Cuy'val Dar.</em> People who have to disappear for eight years or more aren't the family kind. Except Kal, of course. But your family didn't wait for you, did they? That's all right, though. You've got a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> more sons now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">If Etain had known nothing of Skirata, or even Vau, it was the kind of jibe guaranteed to start a fight. Skirata was absolutely and instantly white with anger. One thing she knew about Mandalorians was that clan was a matter of honor. Skirata walked up to Vau very slowly and the strill woke, whining.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain checked that Skirata's jacket with its lethal array of blades was still hanging over the back of the chair.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata shook his head, slow and deliberate. Vau was much taller and a few kilos heavier but Skirata never seemed to worry about that kind of detail.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But that's the good thing about being <em class="calibre6">Mando.</em> If you don't get the family you want, you can go and choose one yourself.” He looked suddenly older and very sad, small, crushed by time. “You going to tell her? Okay, Etain, my sons <em class="calibre6">disowned</em> me. In Mandalorian law, children can legally disown a parent who's shamed them, but it's rare. My sons left with their mother when we split up, and when I disappeared to Kamino and they couldn't locate me, they declared me <em class="calibre6">dar'buir.</em> No longer a father.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh my. Oh, I'm sorry.” Etain knew how serious that would be for a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad.</em> “You found that out when you left Kamino?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. Jango brought the news back that they were looking for me about … oh, four years in? Three maybe? I forget. Two sons and a daughter. Tor, Ijaat, and Ruusaan.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why were they looking for you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My ex-wife died. They wanted me to know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But you could have told them where you were at the time. Jango could have talked to them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You could have made your peace with them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, you could have <em class="calibre6">explained</em> to them somehow and stopped it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And reveal we had an army in training? And compromise my lads' safety? <em class="calibre6">Never.</em> And not a word to any of the boys, you hear? It's the only thing I ever kept from them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd sacrificed his good name and the last possibility of his family's love and forgiveness for the men he was training. It hit Etain hard in the chest like a blow.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She turned to Vau. “Do you see your men as your sons?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course I do. I have no others. It's why I made them into survivors. Don't think I don't love them just because I don't spoil them like kids.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Here we go,” Skirata said, all contempt. “He's going to tell you that his father beat the <em class="calibre6">osik</em> out of him and it made a man of him. Never did <em class="calibre6">him</em> any harm, no sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've lost just three men out of my batch, Kal. That tells me a <em class="calibre6">lot</em> about my methods.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So I lost fourteen. You making a point?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You made yours <em class="calibre6">soft.</em> They don't have that killer edge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I didn't brutalize mine like you did yours, you <em class="calibre6">hut'uun.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain stepped between them, arms held out, pieces of old conversations falling into place with awful clarity. The strill began rumbling in its throat and dropped to the floor to pace protectively in front of Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was just as well the bedroom doors were shut.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Please, stop this. We don't want the men to hear you fighting right now, do we? Like Niner says—save it for the enemy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata turned his head with that sudden total focus that left Etain tasting a ripple in the Force. But it wasn't the angry reaction of a man who had been stung by painful observation. It was genuine anguish. He glanced down at Mird as if considering giving it a good kick, then limped off to the landing platform.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't do this to him,” she said to Vau. “Please. Don't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau simply shrugged and picked up the huge strill in his arms as if it were a pup. It licked his face adoringly. “You can fight ice-cold or you can fight red-hot. Kal fights hot. It's his weakness.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You sound just like an old Master of mine,” Etain said, and went out to the platform after Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Coruscant's skylanes stretched above and below them, giving an illusion of infinity. Etain leaned on the safety rail with her head level with Skirata's as they gazed down. She searched his face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, if you'd like me to do something about Vau—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He shook his head quickly, eyes still downcast. “Thanks, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika,</em> but I can handle that heap of <em class="calibre6">osik.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Never let a bully manipulate you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's jaw worked silently. “I'm to blame.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“For what?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sending boys to their deaths.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, don't do this to yourself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I took the credits, didn't I? Jango whistled and I came running. I trained them from boys. <em class="calibre6">Little boys.</em> Eight, nine years of nothing but training and fighting. No past, no childhood, no future.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They don't go out. They don't get drunk. They don't chase women. We drill them and medicate them and shunt them from battle to battle without a day off, no rest, no fun, and then we scrape them off the battlefield and send what's left standing back to the front.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you alongside them. You gave them a heritage, and a family.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm as bad as Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you hadn't been there, your place would have been taken by another like <em class="calibre6">him.</em> You gave your men respect and affection.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata let out a long breath and folded his hands, elbows still braced on the rail of the balcony. A speeder horn blared far below them. “You know something? <em class="calibre6">Live-fire exercises.</em> They started five years into their development. That means I sent ten-year-old boys to die. And eleven, and twelve, and right on up to the time they were men. I lost four of my batch in training accidents, and—some of those were even down to me, <em class="calibre6">my</em> rifle, <em class="calibre6">my</em> realism. Think about <em class="calibre6">that.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hear that happens in any army.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So ask me the question, then. Why didn't I ever say, <em class="calibre6">Whoa, enough?</em> I've had some unkind thoughts about you, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika,</em> why your kind never refused to lead an army of slaves. And then I thought, Kal, you <em class="calibre6">hut'uun,</em> you're just the same as her. You never stood up against it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your soldiers worship you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata closed his eyes then screwed them tight shut for a moment. “You think that makes me feel better? That stinking strill loves Vau. Monsters get loved irrationally all the time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain wondered whether to soothe him by judiciously influencing his mind that <em class="calibre6">he would not feel guilty.</em> But Skirata was his own man, tough-minded enough to spot her mind influence and shrug her manipulation aside. If she asked him for his cooperation … no, Skirata would never take the easy path. She had no comfort to offer him that wouldn't make matters worse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was part of his unique and appealing courage. Her first impression was that he would be a man whose bluff exterior was simply embarrassed machismo. But Skirata wasn't embarrassed about his emotions at all. He had the guts to wear his heart on his sleeve. It was probably what made him even more effective at killing: he could love as hard as he could punch.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Force, stop reminding me. Duality. I know. I know you can't have light without dark.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Her spiritual struggles were irrelevant now. She was carrying Darman's child. She longed to tell him and knew she had to wait.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You love them, Kal, and love is never wrong.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, I do.” His hard, lined face was an icon of passionate sincerity. “All of them. I started with one hundred and four trainees, plus my Null lads, and now I've got ninety commandos left. They say parents should never have to outlive their kid. But I'm outliving them all, and I suppose that punishment serves me right. I was a rotten father.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No.” He held up his hand to stop her, and she paused. Skirata was benign but absolute authority. “It's not what you think. I'm not using these lads to salve my conscience. They deserve better than that. I'm just using what I've <em class="calibre6">learned—</em>for them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Does it matter, as long as they're loved?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, it <em class="calibre6">does.</em> I have to know that <em class="calibre6">I</em> care about them for who <em class="calibre6">they</em> are, or I've consigned them to being <em class="calibre6">things</em> again. We're <em class="calibre6">Mandalorian.</em> A Mandalorian isn't just a warrior, you see. He's a father, and he's a son, and your family matters. Those boys deserve a father. They deserve sons and daughters, too, but that isn't going to happen. But they can <em class="calibre6">be</em> sons, and the two things you have a duty to teach your sons are self-reliance, and that you'd give your life for them.” Skirata leaned on folded arms and gazed down into the hazy abyss again. “And I would, Etain. I <em class="calibre6">would.</em> And I should have had that degree of conviction when I started this sorry mess back on Kamino.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And walked out? And left them to it? Because it wouldn't have shifted the clone program one bit, even if it made you feel like you'd taken a brave stand.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is that how you feel?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That stalking out and refusing to lead them is more for my comfort than theirs?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He lowered his head on his folded arms for a moment.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that answers my question.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">As a Jedi, Etain had never known a real father any more than a clone had, but in that moment she knew exactly who she wanted him to be. She moved closer to Skirata to let her arm drape on his shoulder and rested her head against his. A tear welled up in the wrinkled corner of his eye then spilled down his cheek, and she wiped it away with her sleeve. He managed a smile even though he kept his gaze fixed on the traffic far below.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're a good man and a good father,” she said. “You should never doubt that for a moment. Your men don't, and neither do I.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, I wasn't a good father until they made one out of me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">But now he would also be a grandfather, too; and she knew it would delight him. She had given Darman back his future. She closed her eyes and savored the new life within her, strong and strange and wonderful.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Qibbu's Hut, main bar, 1800 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Ordo shouldered a space for himself at the bar table between Niner and Boss and helped himself to the container of juice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr was showing Scorch a dangerous trick with a vibroblade that required lightning reflexes to withdraw his hand before the blade thudded into the surface of the table. Scorch seemed wary.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But your hand's metal, you cheating <em class="calibre6">di'kut,”</em> he said. “I <em class="calibre6">bleed.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yaaah, jealous!” Corr jeered. His blade shaved Scorch's finger and went <em class="calibre6">thunnkk</em> in the table to cheers from Jusik and Darman. “You shiny boys always did envy us meat cans.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The two squads seemed in good spirits, good enough to be telling long and elaborate jokes without the usual competitive edge of bravado between Sev and Fi. They had a task to complete in thirty hours and it seemed to have focused them completely, erasing all squad boundaries. It was what Ordo had expected. They were professionals; professionals put the job first. Anything less got you killed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But now they were having fun. Ordo suspected it was the first time they'd ever let their hair down in an environment like this, because it was certainly a first for him. Skirata looked as happy as he had ever seen him. And Jusik sat among them, wearing of all things a chest plate of Mandalorian armor under his jacket.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We presented it to <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> as a souvenir,” Skirata said, rapping his knuckles on the plate. “In case we don't manage to have that fancy dinner.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">In case some of us are dead by the end of tomorrow.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">That was what he meant, and everyone knew it. They lived with it. It just seemed the more poignant now for knowing that a rare bond had been formed between unlikely comrades: two Jedi who openly admitted they struggled with the disciplines of attachment—and Ordo was sure now that he understood that—and a very mixed bag of clone soldiers from captain to trooper who had abandoned rank to answer to a sergeant who didn't answer to <em class="calibre6">anyone.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi, with his uncanny talent for spotting a mood, raised his glass. “Here's to Sicko.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The mention of the pilot's name brought instant reverence to the noisy table.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“To Sicko,” they chorused.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no point grieving: settling a score with Separatists was a far more productive use of their energy. Jusik winked at Ordo, clearly happy in a way that reached beyond noisy laughter in a crowded bar. Whatever moat of serenity and separateness surrounded men like Zey, Jusik's had vanished—if he had ever had it. He was daring to feel part of a tight-knit group of men. Whatever brotherhood was like within the Jedi Order, it didn't appear to be like this.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel, his hair rinsed clean to its natural black, was now holding court and reciting an astonishing list of obscenities in forty different languages. So far he hadn't repeated himself once. Fi was bent double over the table, roaring with laughter.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even Niner was enjoying it, contributing the odd word of Huttese. “It's nice to know that your advanced linguistic skills were devoted to something useful.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Urpghurit,”</em> Mereel said, deadpan.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Disgusting,” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Baay shfat.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“What does that mean?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel whispered a translation in Fi's ear and his face fell slightly. Mereel frowned. “Don't tell me you've never heard that one.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We were raised to be polite boys,” Fi said, clearly aghast. “Can Hutts really do that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You better believe it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not sure I like civilian society,” Fi said. “I think I felt safer under fire.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Coming from Fi, it would usually have been a joke. But like all his jokes, bitter reality lay not far beneath. Fi hadn't adjusted gracefully to the outside world. There was a moment of silence as reality intruded on all of them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll shoot you and cheer you up, then,” Sev said suddenly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Everyone laughed again. Darman drained his glass and got up to go. Scorch flicked a warra nut at him with impressive accuracy, and it bounced off his head. “Where you going, Dar?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm off to calibrate my Deece.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was more raucous laughter. Darman didn't look amused. He shrugged and walked off in the direction of the turbolift through a crowd of men from the Forty-first Elite who were shipping out in a few days. At least they'd had something few troopers ever would: two weeks without fighting. They didn't appear to be enjoying it, though. <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> said that was what happened when you let someone out of prison after a long sentence. They didn't fit in and they didn't know how to live outside a cell or without a familiar routine.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I know, though. And Fi</em> wants <em class="calibre6">to know.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't wind him up about Etain, son,” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch looked wary. “He's not breaking any regulation, is he?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't think so, but she is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The best thing was <em class="calibre6">not</em> to think.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What happens to us when the war's over?” Corr asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel smiled. “You'll have the thanks of a grateful Republic. Now, who can guess what <em class="calibre6">this</em> Ubese word means?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo glanced at Skirata, who raised his glass. Atin came to take Darman's place at the table with the Twi'lek Laseema on his arm: the man obviously wasn't as shy as he seemed. Except for Vau and Etain, the entire strike team had gathered here, and there was some sense of an important bond having been accomplished. It also felt very <em class="calibre6">final.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You and Mereel are up to something,” Skirata said. “I can tell.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He has news, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir,”</em> Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Should he tell him now? He'd thought it might distract him too much. But he didn't need to provide detail. It would give <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> heart for what was to come.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's traced where our mutual friend fled immediately after the battle.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no need to say that the <em class="calibre6">friend</em> was Kaminoan scientist Ko Sai, the head of the cloning program, or that she had gone missing after the Battle of Kamino. The hunt—and it was a private matter, not Republic business, although the Grand Army footed the bill—was often reduced to just two words: <em class="calibre6">Any news?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And if any of his other brothers—Prudii, A'den, Kom'rk, Jaing—found anything as well, Skirata would be told. They might have been carrying out intelligence missions for the Republic, but their true focus was finding elements of Kaminoan cloning technology that only Ko Sai had access to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's face became luminous. It seemed to erase every crease and scar for a few moments.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is what I want to hear,” he said softly. “You <em class="calibre6">will</em> have a future, all of you. I swear it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik was watching him with interest. There was no point trying to conceal anything of an emotional nature from Jedi as sensitive to the living Force as Jusik and Etain, but it was unlikely that Skirata had shared that secret with him. He hadn't even told his commando squads. It was too fragile a mission; it was safer for them all not to know for the time being.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik raised his glass. It was just juice. Nobody would drink before a mission if they had any sense. Alcohol had proved not to be a major preoccupation with commandos anyway: and, whatever had been rumored, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir's</em> only concession to alcohol was one glass of fiery colorless <em class="calibre6">tihaar</em> atnight to try to get to sleep. He found sleep increasingly elusive as the years of training progressed on Kamino and his conscience tore him apart piece by piece.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd sleep well without it tonight, even if it was in a chair.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is very, very good news,” Skirata said, a changed man for the moment. “I'd dare to say it bodes well.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They drank and joked and argued about Hutt curses. And then Skirata's comlink chirped, and he answered it discreetly, head lowered. Ordo simply heard him say, “Now? Are you <em class="calibre6">serious?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“What is it?” Ordo said. Mereel paused in midcurse, too, and the table fell silent.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's our <em class="calibre6">customer,”</em> Skirata said, jaw tense again. “They've hit a small snag. They need to move tonight. There's no preparation, <em class="calibre6">ad'ike—we</em> have to roll in three hours.”</div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_23" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36425443" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36425444" class="calibre8"></a>20 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You know that thing that sergeants are always supposed to yell at new recruits? “I am your mother! I am your father!” Well, what do you do when that's actually true? Kal Skirata was all they had. And the troopers didn't have anyone. How can you expect those boys to grow up normal?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–Captain Jailer Obrim, to his wife over dinner</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Operational house, Qibbu's</strong><strong class="calibre11">Hut, 1935 hours, 385 days after </strong><strong class="calibre11">Geonosis: whole strike team ready to</strong><strong class="calibre11">deploy</strong></div>

<div class="paragraph">“So what's your <em class="calibre6">shabla</em> problem, then, Perrive?” Skirata conducted the conversation with his wrist comlink propped on the table while he strapped on his <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> armor. Ordo stood out of range of the comlink's mike, holding Obrim on the line via his own link. “Cold feet? Can't get the finance in place? What, exactly?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't need to act angry. He <em class="calibre6">was.</em> Everyone in the team was used to working on the fly, but all the planning—the careful positioning to take out the maximum number of bodies—now teetered on the brink of disaster. Around him, Delta and Omega were armoring up in full fighting order: Katarn rig with DC-17s, grenades, rappelling lines, rapid entry ordnance, and a Plex rocket launcher per squad.</div>

<div class="paragraph">For a moment he was unsettled to see Omega and Vau both in black armor. <em class="calibre6">But they're mine. They're my squad.</em> He renewed his concentration on Perrive's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One of our colleagues has been picked up by the police.” Perrive's Jabiimi accent was very noticeable now. It was an indication of stress. And that was encouraging at an animal level for a mercenary. Skirata gestured frantically to Ordo but his head was already lowered, chin tucked into his chest as he relayed the information to Obrim. “We need to move our operation.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you want me to drop by with the groceries when you've got CSF crawling all over you? I'm still wanted for seven contract killings in town.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo gave a <em class="calibre6">standing by</em> signal: hand at shoulder level, fingers spread.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive swallowed audibly. “They're not <em class="calibre6">crawling all over us,</em> as you put it. One man was arrested. He might be a weak link.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Cross-check this with Obrim.</em> “Where? This better not be in my backyard.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Industrial sector, pulled over for an illegal cannon upgrade to his speeder.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo nodded once and then gave a thumbs-up. <em class="calibre6">Confirmed.</em> Skirata felt his shoulders relax immediately. “Call me suspicious, but last time somebody did this to me they didn't plan on paying. You're not sticking to our timetable.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm afraid it's just a good old-fashioned screwup.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll be at your location at twenty-two-hundred hours, then. But you won't mind if I bring a couple of my colleagues just to be on the safe side.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not there. We have transport issues.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What does that mean?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I mean we need to move our vessels somewhere safe. Bring the consignment to us at our landing strip and load it straight on.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch stepped in front of Skirata with as near to an expression of boyish delight as the man was ever going to manage. He mouthed <em class="calibre6">CoruFresh</em> at him. Any good mercenary could lip-read, because if he wasn't already deafened by long exposure to gunfire, he couldn't hear a word in battle anyway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I need a location.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We have a few vessels laid up in the commercial sector in Quadrant F-Seventy-six.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata watched Scorch clench both fists and pull his elbows hard into his sides in a gesture of silent, total triumph. They were heading for at least one site at which they'd done a thorough recce.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I need coordinates and I need to know <em class="calibre6">exactly</em> what I can expect to see when I show up—so I know I'm not walking into a CSF welcoming committee.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You really do have a record, don't you?” said Perrive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Isn't that why you're doing business with me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Very well. Six speeder trucks with CoruFresh livery and four passenger airspeeders—two Koros, two custom J-twelves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“For a hundred kilos of thermal? I can carry that with my nephew in two shopping bags, <em class="calibre6">chakaar”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're not our only supplier of equipment, <em class="calibre6">Mando.</em> And I have personnel to move. I know you'll spit on this, but we're soldiers, and we have a code of honor. We want the goods for the price we agreed. No trap.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata paused for effect. “So I'll meet you there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, it'll be my deputy. The woman you saw at our meeting earlier. I'm moving via another route.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Transmit the coordinates now and we'll start packing our bags.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Your credits will be in the account you specified at twenty-one-fifty.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Pleasure doing business. But the minute I see CSF-issue blasters or even a hint of blue uniform, we're banging out.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata closed the link and for a moment there was absolute silence in a room full of fifteen hot, anxious, adrenaline-laden bodies. Then there was a loud collective whoop of satisfaction. Even Etain joined in, and Skirata hadn't reckoned her for wild displays of enthusiasm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So all was not lost after all, <em class="calibre6">vode,”</em> Vau said. Lord Mirdalan was frantic, bouncing on its front legs while the other four scrabbled for purchase on the tattered carpet. Adrenaline excited strills and made them eager to hunt. “Plan B. Disable the vessels and slot the occupants.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Disable … ,” Scorch said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Minimum force required to do the job. We're in a city, remember.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Holochart,” Ordo said. “I've still got Obrim on this link. Quick sitrep, people.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">They clustered around Corr, who was collating the moving red lines and points of light with quiet enthusiasm. <em class="calibre6">Methodical, calm lad.</em> He'd need to be that in bomb disposal. “They've been going all shades of crazy <em class="calibre6">here</em> and <em class="calibre6">here.”</em> He zoomed into the holoimage and indicated two tangled masses of red lines like loose balls of thread, both in the retail sector of Quadrant B-85, where Fi had carried out the surveillance of Vinna Jiss. It suggested that tagged suspects had done an awful lot of repeated movement. “I'd say they're shifting kit by hand. Plenty of it, in two locations. But the two apartments Captain Ordo recce'd have been totally dead for hours. They've left.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata knew what he'd do in their position. He'd assemble what kit he had, move it discreetly to a central point, and then ship out. He wouldn't send a big, conspicuous repulsor truck to pick up from a dozen locations.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's all going out via the crates on that landing strip,” he said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Agreed.” Ordo and Mereel nodded.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch just grinned.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A red point of light suddenly moved from the location of the house in the banking sector where Skirata had met Perrive. They watched it moving fast: someone had left the house in a speeder. “Holocam,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo played out the remote image from his glove emitter. A speeder had taken off from the roof.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd bet that was Perrive leaving,” said Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata knew they'd lose some of the key players, but this was about making as big a dent in the Sep terror ranks as possible. “Pity. Maybe we can catch up with him later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi held out his palm with a remote detonator on it. “If he's flying that green speeder.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The one they took me in?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can blow it anytime you like, Sarge.” The commandos had slipped back into calling him Sarge. It seemed to happen when they put their armor on again. “I stuck a nice big surprise in his air intake last night.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was in that speeder.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know. Clever, wasn't it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata took the det and checked that it was disabled before slipping it in his pocket.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Ord'ika, let</em> me talk to Jailer.” He held his hand out for the comlink to Obrim. “Can your people cover the locations we gave you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim's voice was tight with tension. “We're pulling people back off shifts now. We're synchronizing this for twenty two-hundred, are we?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Correct. I'll patch you into my comlink for the duration, but don't talk to me unless it's critical. Other than that, stay away from the area coordinates we're going to transmit to you, and pretend we never existed.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry about the arrest—not my team. A routine firearms control stop, I'm afraid.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“At least it made them bolt. They're <em class="calibre6">vulnerable</em> when they bolt.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll talk to you in twelve hours if all goes smoothly, then. Next breakfast's on you, remember?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You take care, too, friend.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The tangle of possibilities and risks in Skirata's mind had become crystal clear. Two key parts of the operation were now as pinned down as they could be: the synchronized raid on the lower-priority terrorist targets by CSF, and the interception of an unspecified number of key players at the landing strip, along with their vessels.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remember, <em class="calibre6">vode.</em> No prisoners.” Skirata took out his medpac and prepared a one-use painkiller syringe. Then he rolled down the soft leather of his left boot and stabbed the needle deep into his ankle. The pain made his muscles shake but he clenched his teeth and let it pass. This was <em class="calibre6">not</em> the night to be slowed down by a limp. “Shoot to kill.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fourteen men and one woman to kill maybe twenty terrorists. Very expensive use of manpower compared to droid kill rates. But worth it.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There were a few more targets still wandering around out there, ones they hadn't even tagged. But when it came to destroying a small organization like a group of terror cells, taking out a cell like this one would have enormous impact. It slowed them down. It set them back while they recruited and reorganized and retrained.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Even a few <em class="calibre6">months</em> made all the difference in this war.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Walon,” he said. “Take one of my Verpine rifles tonight. Might come in handy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm grateful, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, <em class="calibre6">vode.</em> This is now Captain Ordo's command as ranking officer—even if we have no ranks right now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata swung his arms through the full range of movement to check the fit of his armor, the sand-gold suit that his adoptive father Munin had given him. He put his knife—the knife he had retrieved from his real father's dead body—up his right sleeve, handle uppermost. He could barely remember his parents or even his original name, but Munin Skirata was as vivid as life and still with him every day, one of the precious departed whose names he recited each night.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He hit his gauntlets against his chest plate to snap himself out of memories. Both squads jumped.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Lord Mirdalan, jowls flapping, threw its head back and let out a long, low, moaning howl. The preparations had worked the strill into a hunting frenzy. It could see its master in full Mandalorian armor, and it smelled and heard men who were tense and ready to fight. All its instincts and training said <em class="calibre6">hunt, hunt, hunt.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">And Vau held his gloved hand out to Atin. Astonishingly, Atin took it. There was nothing but the battle in mind now. They were all saving it for the enemy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata felt the visceral thrill tighten his throat and stomach. It had been many years since he'd put on <em class="calibre6">this</em> armor to fight.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Buy'cese!”</em> he said. Helmets on!</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was, he knew, a sight few would believe—Walon Vau and a Jedi Knight <em class="calibre6">both</em> in full Mandalorian armor, and Republic Commandos, ARC troopers, and a clone trooper in fighting order so closely modeled on that armor he wore himself that they looked like one united army. He pulled on his own helmet before anyone noticed the tears in his eyes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I ought to get a holo of this,” Corr said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain stood among them, incongruously fragile.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I could have lent you my Hokan armor, General,” Fi said. “Only one careless owner.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain lifted her tunic to reveal plates of body armor. “I'm not stupid.” Then she pulled out two lightsabers. Skirata winced. “Mine, and Master Fuller's. He'd have relished a fight like this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was not herself tonight, if her usual self was that worried, awkward, but tenacious soul who found it so hard to be a Jedi. She was utterly <em class="calibre6">alive.</em> Darman seemed to be able to strike sparks off her. Skirata hoped she did the same for him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau flung out his arm to signal the strill to race ahead. <em class="calibre6">“Oya! Oya!”</em> Let's go hunting! <em class="calibre6">“Oya,</em> Mird!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill bayed at the top of its voice and shot out the doors to the landing platform.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo turned to the strike team. <em class="calibre6">“Oya! Oya, vode!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">It was electric. It had never happened before, and it would probably never happen again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And they went hunting.</div>

<div class="paragraph">–Popular drinking chant of Mandalorian mercenaries—approximate translation, edited for strong language</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Landing area, CoruFresh Farm Produce distribution division, Quadrant F-76, 2035 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The produce distribution depot was as familiar as Arca Barracks now. Everything was as the holochart and holocam images had modeled it, although some of the vessels had been moved in the last hour. Ordo took a small risk and flew the airspeeder over the CoruFresh landing strip at a cautious height just for reassurance. The depot was a lake of harsh white light dotted with loader droids, trucks, and an assortment of speeders. There were more vessels parked there than Perrive had said. They were probably legitimate transports shipping nothing more deadly than fruit.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think CoruFresh might be annoyed about the damage to their fleet in the morning,” Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's their problem for not being too choosy about the company they keep.” Sev secured one of the Verpine rifles to his webbing. He seemed to take Skirata's warning about bending anyone who bent his kit quite literally. “They must be bankrolled by crime gangs themselves.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll be doing CSF a favor, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was always a challenge to insert teams into a busy location. Air traffic data said the strip clocked an average of 120 trucks and cargo lifters passing through the strip every twenty-four hours; 2000 to 2300 hours seemed to be the period when it almost shut down completely. That was probably why the Separatists had picked the 2200 time slot for Skirata to deliver the explosives. They'd be loaded and gone by the time the overnight deliveries started again at 2300.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If the teams had gone in early, they would have needed to avoid an awful lot of people and droids.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You ever carried out an assault on an urban objective before?” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. N'dian. Heard of it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev paused to check his HUD database. Ordo could see the icon flash up on his own HUD over the shared link. He heard Sev swallow.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I meant one where you had to leave the place pretty well intact, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In that case, Sev, no. It'll be a first.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Glad we could share this moment, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo parked the airspeeder next to the small substation that routed utilities to the industrial area where the CoruFresh depot was located. A meter-wide conduit carrying pipes and cables stretched out twenty meters from the substation to span a gap that was five hundred meters deep. That was their route in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All tooled up?” Ordo shouldered two Plex missile launchers against his pauldron, one on each side.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Shoulder okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi has a big mouth.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi knows that I need to know if any of my team is compromised by injury.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm fine, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo nudged him. <em class="calibre6">“Oya, ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo led the way across the conduit, checking Sev's progress in his HUD. A man who'd nearly fallen to his death could get a little nervous at heights like this. But Sev advanced as if he were on solid ground, and they slipped into the cover of crates and containers at the rear wall of the warehouse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega, are you in position?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner's voice crackled slightly in Ordo's comlink. “We're one hundred fifty meters from the perimeter, sir. Southeast of the strip at the waste, processing depot.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Any activity in the vessels parked on the eastern edge of the strip?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All quiet except for maintenance droids. Dar sent up a surveillance remote and all the wets are clustered at the warehouse entrance moving boxes. They've backed up two of the trucks against the loading bay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're going to position ourselves on the roof, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The warehouse was a single-story building with an unforgiving flat roof that meant anyone in the two repulsor trucks on the far side of the landing area would notice troops moving around. It was the only high vantage point overlooking the floodlit landing area to direct fire as well as pick off a few targets for themselves. Ordo had decided it was asking for trouble to take up a position in the residential towers nearly a thousand meters away. If they wound up on the receiving end of returned fire, there would be a lot of dead civilians to explain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Up you go,” said Ordo.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev fired his rappelling line over the roof and tugged on it to ensure it was secure. The small winch in his belt took most of his weight but he pushed off with his boots, looking almost as if he were walking up the vertical surface. Ordo waited as Sev rolled flat over the edge of the roof, Verpine rifle in his right hand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Roof clear, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo fired his own line and let the winch lift him until he could reach the roof with his hand. He handed Sev the Plex launchers and hauled himself over the top to crawl flat on elbows and knees until he was near the front edge of the roof.</div>

<div class="paragraph">They both flipped down the scopes in their visors at the same time. Ordo saw the same image repeated in Sev's viewpoint icon on the margin of his HUD.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In an ideal world, we could have left a timed charge on that utility conduit and paralyzed this whole sector before we went in,” Sev said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And that just advertises the fact that the Grand Army was here. We don't exist, remember? We've gone bandit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just fantasizing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The textbook approach was to knock out the two illumigrids and then move in. But timing was critical. Skirata and Jusik needed to make the delivery of explosives and then get clear before the party started.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega, we're in position.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that.” This time it was Mereel's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“On my mark, we'll knock out both lights and then provide covering fire while you advance from the south side. Delta, what's your location?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Boss here, sir. We'll be in position behind the warehouse in two minutes. Atin and Fixer will enter from the front. Scorch and I will cover the north side of the strip.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin seemed to have slipped easily into the temporary gap left by Sev. There wasn't the slightest hint in their voices that their former brother wasn't welcome. Ordo supposed that once you were one of Vau's trainees, you could merge back into the batch without comment when there was a job to be done.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, <em class="calibre6">vode.</em> Now we watch and wait.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Mereel, Fi, Niner, Darman, and Corr crouched in the cover of a conveyor belt of bins outside the waste depot, where droids collected the contents for compaction and disposal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi sniffed dubiously. There was the distinct sulfurous tang of rotting vegetables: harmless, or his helmet's filter would never have let the aroma through, but nauseating nonetheless. On Niner's signal, they sprinted from the bins and dropped down by a pillar at the end of the walkway that led across to the CoruFresh depot.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're very shiny, you two,” Niner said, jerking his thumb at Corr and Mereel, who were almost glowing in the light from the red flashing sign of a seedy caf bar. “Why don't you just write SHOOT ME HERE on that <em class="calibre6">di'kutla</em> white armor?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You rely on that black stuff way too much,” Mereel said. “It's all about a stealthy approach, you see,” He heaved a massive Merr-Sonn Reciprocating Quad Blaster onto his hip and powered up the microrepulsorlift to take some of its weight. Four huge double-barreled blaster muzzles loomed from the weapon's body. It was close on eighty centimeters long and looked more like a cruiser's close-in defense cannon. “Stealth, and a nice big Cip-Quad, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi patted Corr's conspicuously white shoulder. “His men will follow him anywhere, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.</em> But only out of curiosty.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, get curious, then.” Mereel indicated the direction of the landing strip. “They've moved some of the vessels, so we're going to have to cover a little extra open ground. At least most of the cockpits are facing the same way so we might have a blind spot to take advantage of.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman, Verpine rifle slung across his back, was still examining the other impressive item of Merr-Sonn firepower excess that was balanced across his thighs, the Z-6 Rotary Blaster. It was almost as big as the Cip-Quad. He looked wary of it and passed it to Corr. “We really <em class="calibre6">did</em> say no prisoners, didn't we, sir?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not exactly a sniper weapon, I know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Etain would like that,” Fi said. “Bit classier than her Trannie LJ-50.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel snorted. “The general can get her <em class="calibre6">own</em> rotary. That's <em class="calibre6">my</em> baby.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Beats a bunch of flowers, Dar …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Has she called in yet, by the way?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo's voice cut in. There was no privacy on <em class="calibre6">this</em> frequency. “She and Vau followed Perrive's trace to an apartment in zone three, Quadrant A-Four. They're watching him now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Isn't that a diplomatic quarter?” asked Mereel, whose capacity for memorizing data seemed as unlimited as his brother's.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“ 'Fraid so,” said Ordo. “That could get interesting. If we go in there, we're into a whole new level of deniability.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi watched Darman's head drop for a moment, but there wasn't so much as a breath or a click of teeth. He snapped back to his alert position. Fi wasn't sure if he was afraid for Etain's safety or of what she might do, and he didn't plan to ask. “Vau doesn't need that strill when he's got a Jedi with him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He takes Mird everywhere,”, Mereel said. “Like <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> fathers take their sons into battle.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I didn't know Old Psycho was a head case, I'd say that was cute. What is it going to do?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've never seen a strill hunt, have you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel didn't say another word. He signaled <em class="calibre6">advance</em> to Niner with a sweep of his hand and the squad sprinted for the perimeter of the landing strip.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Diplomatic sector, Quadrant A-4, 2145 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Etain stood on the ledge of a soaring office tower facing the elegant apartment block and realized exactly what <em class="calibre6">black ops</em> truly meant.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau stood beside her. The ledge was about 150 centimeters wide, and the breeze at this height was noticeable even on climate-controlled Coruscant.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's the matter?” Vau said, his parade-ground voice slightly softened by his <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> helmet. “Didn't know how dirty politics could be? That diplomats aren't all nice honest people? That they keep unpleasant company?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think I worked that out already.” She felt the strill brush past her legs, padding impatiently up and down the narrow ledge. It had no fear of heights, it seemed. “But the consequences of pursuing Perrive into that building reach far beyond assassinating a terrorist.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We'll have to get him to come out, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He could lie low there for weeks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If he's <em class="calibre6">hiding,</em> yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I find you hard to follow sometimes, Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He might be <em class="calibre6">collecting</em> something or somebody. He was in a mad rush to leave.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I sense he's alone. He isn't picking up a colleague.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau leveled the scope of the Verpine, angled down about thirty degrees. The strill teetered on the edge of the ledge.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can see Perrive. Yes, he's alone. He's in front of the doors to the balcony—now that's <em class="calibre6">arrogant, my</em> friend. Think nobody can see you, eh? Etain, want to take a look?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau handed her the Verpine. She took it nervously, hearing Skirata's constant admonition to take care of the weapon, and was surprised how light and harmless it felt. She peered down the scope and felt Vau reach out and flick something on the optic. A different image appeared in the eyepiece, slightly pink-tinted, of a man rummaging through a desk and sticking datachips into his 'pad, activating them, and then extracting and discarding them. A pale blob of light shimmered from his chest and then from his back as he turned.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What can you see?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's loading data,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's shredding someone's files. Told you so.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's the white light? The EM emissions from the Dust?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Correct.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain handed back the rifle. “That datapad is going to contain some interesting material. How do we get hold of it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The old-fashioned way.” Vau sounded as if he'd smiled. It was hard to tell under the helmet. “Let's get him to come to the balcony.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not sure I can influence his mind at this range … or at all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No need, my dear.” Vau folded a cloth one-handed and placed it under the stock of the Verpine at the point where it touched his armored shoulder. “I hate a standing shot without something to lean against, but I'm not as sure-footed as Mird so I'm not going to attempt to kneel.” He leaned back slightly against the wall at his back. “But this Verpine is <em class="calibre6">beautiful.”</em> He rested his firing hand on his raised forearm. “It's almost a handgun.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just tell me what you're going to do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Make a noise on his balcony so he steps outside.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What if he doesn't?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then we'll have to go in and get him the hard way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But if you—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's get him outside if we can.” Vau paused to let an air-speeder pass. The narrow skylane was almost deserted. “Most armies I ended up serving had no notion of advance planning. I got to be <em class="calibre6">very</em> good at unorthodox solutions.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain couldn't help but feel the patterns in the Force right then. Being pregnant seemed to have enhanced her sensitivity to the living Force by an order of magnitude. Vau felt like a pool of utter cold calm, almost a Jedi Master's footprint in the Force. The strill felt … alien. It had an unfathomable glittering intelligence and a wild, joyful heart swirling within it. Had it not been for Vau's rifle and the krill's savage teeth, the pair might have felt like a peaceful man and his happy child.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She felt something else, as she did constantly now: the vivid, complex pattern of her unborn child.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">It's a boy.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I'm standing on a ledge with thousands of meters of nothing below me. And I am not afraid.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She stopped herself from reaching out to Darman in the Force. It might distract him at a critical moment. She simply felt that he was safe and confident, and that was enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Could you choke him using the Force?” Vau said quietly.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just asking. Very handy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I was never trained to do <em class="calibre6">that.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Pity. All those fine combat skills wasted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau exhaled audibly and paused. There was the slightest of movements in her peripheral vision as he squeezed the trigger, and a small <em class="calibre6">snakkk</em> echoed as a puff of vaporized stone billowed briefly off the corner of the apartment wall.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ahh … ,” Vau said. The rifle's scope was still pressed to the eye slit in his black helmet. He looked like the very image of death. Much as Etain had grown to find that armor reassuring, it made it no less intimidating. “Now, this is not a man used to avoiding professional assassins. Watch carefully and tell me what you feel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Perrive paused at the transparisteel doors leading onto the balcony and shoved the datapad inside his tunic. Then he took out his blaster. He opened the doors by a meter, no more, and stood looking around, blaster raised, one foot still inside the apartment, one on the balcony itself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain heard Vau exhale and then Perrive's head jerked backward with a brief plume of dark blood as if he had been punched by an invisible fist. He fell, arms thrown wide.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Dead. Gone.</em> Whatever had been Perrive was now gone from the Force: no pain, no surprise, and suddenly <em class="calibre6">not there.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird the strill was staring up at its master, unblinking, tail thrashing the ledge in enthusiasm. It began making little whimpering noises deep in its throat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre6">must</em> treat myself to one of these,” Vau said, still all complete calm and satisfaction, gazing at the Verpine rifle. “Outstanding craftspeople, those little insectoids.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's dead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I should think so. The hydrostatic shock generated by a Verpine projectile is <em class="calibre6">substantial.</em> A clean head shot is instantaneous <em class="calibre6">kyr'am.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“But the datapad is still in his tunic.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good!” He turned to the strill and put his finger to his lips. <em class="calibre6">“Udesii,</em> Mird … silence! <em class="calibre6">K'uur!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill stared up into his face, gold eyes fixed on his, head drawn back a little into its cowl-like folds of loose skin. Its whimpering stopped abruptly. Vau crouched down and held out his arm as if pointing, and closed his fingers into a fist. <em class="calibre6">“Oya … ,”</em> he whispered. “Find the <em class="calibre6">aruetii!</em> Find the traitor!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird spun around and stabbed its claws into the stonework. Etain watched, stunned, as it climbed the wall and made its way to the next ledge above. The strill appeared to understand what was said to it, even hand signals. But she had no idea what it was doing.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Oya,</em> Mird!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill balanced on its four rear legs and then sprang into the abyss.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh my—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">And then Etain suddenly realized why the strill looked so bizarre. It spread all six legs, and the loose, ugly skin that made it appear such a shambling mess was stretched taut by the air pressure beneath it. It glided effortlessly down in a perfect stoop onto the balcony opposite.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau took off his helmet and wiped his brow. His face was a study in complete admiration and … yes, <em class="calibre6">love.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clever Mird,” he murmured. “Clever baby!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's a <em class="calibre6">glider!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Extraordinary animals, strills.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's going to fetch the datapad?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau paused. Etain could see a smile forming on his lips. “Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is it male or female?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Both,” Vau said. “Mird has been with me since I joined the Mandalorians. Strills live far longer than humans. Who'll care for it when I'm dead?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sure someone will value it greatly.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want it to be <em class="calibre6">cared for,</em> not valued.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau replaced his helmet. They waited. Etain strained to see when the animal emerged from the apartment with, she imagined, the datapad clamped in its teeth. Or maybe it had more surprises in store, like a pouch, as Jinart the Gurlanin had.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She stared, aghast.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird had dragged Perrive's body out onto the balcony and was worrying at it. She believed the animal was trying to tear out the datapad right up to the moment that it got a good grip with its massive jaws on the corpse's shoulder and hauled it up onto the safety rail.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's it doing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau laughed. Mird balanced the body on the rail like a sack of stones, wobbled a little, and then launched itself into the air. Etain was stunned by its ability to move a man weighing at least eighty kilos, but not half as stunned as when she saw its free fall turn into a vertical climb as it struck out and its parachute of skin became <em class="calibre6">wing membranes.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird soared like a raptor, carrying its prey.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird <em class="calibre6">flew</em>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek … ,” Etain said. There was no other word for it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Language!” Vau said, clearly amused. Mird thudded onto the ledge and hauled Perrive up behind it. Vau crouched as best he could on the narrow strip of stone and felt inside the tunic for the datapad. “Got it. Let's go. Good Mird! Clever Mird! <em class="calibre6">Mirdala Mird'ika!”</em> He opened his comlink. “Kal, Perrive's no longer a problem, and we have a useful datapad. See you shortly.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird was ecstatic, whimpering and slobbering in delight as Vau rubbed its head. As retrievers went, it could have no equal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What about the body?” Etain said, still stunned. “Are we just leaving it here? On an office window ledge?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It'll give CSF's forensics team a <em class="calibre6">fascinating</em> project to keep them occupied,” Vau said. “And we didn't even have to enter a diplomatic compound, did we?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain, now used to death and assassination, couldn't help herself. She reached over and rubbed the still's head, too, although it stank and could probably kill her in a single vast bite. It was still miraculous.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Clever Mird!” she said. <em class="calibre6">“Clever!”</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Somewhere near CoruFresh Farm Produce distribution </strong><strong class="calibre11">division, Quadrant F-76, 2150 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“That armor suits you, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sat astride the speeder's pillion seat, datapad and chrono at the ready. The operation was under way. Perrive was dead. Now it was time for Skirata to check that the credit transfer had been made.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He watched the screen that showed the status of the temporary bank account that would vanish without trace or audit trail in just over a day.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I suspect the Jedi Council wouldn't agree.” Jusik adjusted the bags on the bike's cargo straps. “Not even if General Kenobi himself wears armor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You don't worry much about that,” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I haven't thought that far ahead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> mercenary has to plan for the future these days, son, even if there turns out to be no future at all. And so should you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik laughed. “I thought you <em class="calibre6">Mando'ade</em> lived only for the day. You even have trouble using anything but the present tense.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's eyes never left the datapad's screen. Then it reloaded, and suddenly an anonymous numbered account in a bank on Aargau was four million credits in the black. Skirata hit VERIFY and the credits were <em class="calibre6">there.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes, this was real. <em class="calibre6">He had the credits.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He felt one tension evaporate from his chest and another—familiar, comfortable, an old friend—take its place. He was ready to fight. He opened the comlink to the whole strike team.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Stand by, <em class="calibre6">vode,</em> stand by. The credits have cleared. We're moving in to make the drop now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo here, copy that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta here, copy that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mereel here, copy that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Do we get ten percent?” Fi muttered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik powered up the speeder bike. “You'd be amazed what you might get out of this, Fi.” The speeder shot up into the air and spun ninety degrees before Jusik aimed it at the CoruFresh depot. “Preferably not a broken neck, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Kal,” said Jusik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata checked his chrono: 2155.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A good rousing chant of <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda</em> might have psyched him up better, but this was a different battlefield.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Bard'ika,</em> those explosive packs <em class="calibre6">are</em> well wrapped, aren't they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thoroughly. They're really affecting the handling of this speeder, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've got a few minutes. Take it easy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Udesii ...”</em> Jusik grinned. “If things get a little hairy out there, I <em class="calibre6">can</em> use my Force powers, can't I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No witnesses. Go ahead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik took the speeder high over the landing strip, and Skirata noted Ordo and Sev flat on the roof of the warehouse as they spiraled down to land. The two soldiers didn't move. Omega and Delta were nowhere to be seen. That reassured him enormously. It had been a joy to train commandos who became better soldiers than he could ever be.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Tonight would test them, though. There were enough explosives in the area now to take out a quadrant and well beyond. Fine on a battlefield—but not in a city.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Careful. Go careful.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The speeder settled and hung at rest just above the ground. A group of five men and the middle-aged woman he'd seen at the meeting earlier were the welcoming committee, and they all had blasters visible on belts or held loosely at their sides. They directed Jusik to a spot between two trucks, sheltered from anyone who might pass by.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata and Jusik got off the speeder bike and stood with their arms at their sides, calm and business-like. Skirata removed his helmet. Jusik kept his <em class="calibre6">buy'ce</em> on.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The credits cleared fine,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The woman inspected the speeder, which was laden like a Tatooine bantha with anonymous bags of rough sacking. “This is <em class="calibre6">all</em> the five-hundred-grade?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Four hundred quarter-kilo packs, bagged in tens. I suggest you split the load for safety.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The woman shrugged. “We know how to handle explosives.” She reached out to unfasten one bag and squatted down to slide the ten bundled packets onto the ground. She squinted at the thick packaging and took out a knife from her pocket…</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't need to see Jusik's face to know that the blood had drained from it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Don't stick anything metallic into it. The electrolytic reaction will set it off</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel's little chemical enhancement to thwart the bomb makers in the event of their getting away with any of the explosives was about to kill them all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whoa!” Skirata sighed irritably and hoped to the Force that he didn't sound the terrified man he was right then. “Don't shove a knife in that, woman! Unwrap it properly. Here, let me do it. Are you <em class="calibre6">sure</em> you know what you're doing?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a collective involuntary gasp in his comlink earpiece, a very restrained one. He heard Ordo mutter, <em class="calibre6">“Osik.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You insolent little Mandalorian <em class="calibre6">thug,”</em> she sneered, but she stood back to let him take over. And she held her blaster to his head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata ripped the bundle open with nervous hands and broke out one packet, tearing the flexiwrap with his teeth to expose the soft light brown contents. It tasted … oddly sweet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Here. Believe me?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The woman scowled at him and squeezed the explosive between her fingers. “I'm checking that this isn't just dyed detonite.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Tell you what,” Skirata said, wondering if Jusik might try a spot of mind influence right then, “pick as many packs as you like at random and I'll unwrap them, and then you can prove to yourself that they're not booby-trapped, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He heard Ordo's voice in his ear. <em class="calibre6">“Kal'buil,</em> you're scaring us …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay.” The woman pointed to another bag on the speeder bike. “That one. Empty it in front of me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata obeyed. He unwrapped the bundle and waited for her to choose a pack at random. He tore it open and let her inspect it. She repeated the process three times.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata stood up, hands on hips, and sighed theatrically. “I've got all night, sweetheart. Have you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The woman looked into his face as if she liked the idea of killing him anyway. “Bag it up and get out of here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He glanced at his chrono: 2220. Obrim would be getting jumpy now, with squads of CSF officers waiting throughout Galactic City to raid the long list of suspect addresses he'd given them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You heard the lady.” He shoved Jusik in the back. “Get on with it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The last few seconds before a hasty exit were always the most terrifying. A hairbreadth lay between victory and defeat, life and death. Jusik secured the last of the bags and dumped the rest from the speeder in a pile between the trucks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now get lost,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I take it I can't count you as a repeat customer, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She raised the blaster eloquently. Skirata replaced his helmet and swung onto the speeder bike behind Jusik. They lifted into the air and climbed above the warehouse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek,” said Darman's voice in his ear. “I hate it when you improvise, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Like you don't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Standing by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo cut in. “The woman's loading all the explosives except a single bag into one truck. The one with the green livery nearest the loading bay. I repeat, <em class="calibre6">negative</em> the green truck. Do <em class="calibre6">not</em> target the green truck or it's good-bye to half of Coruscant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Females never listen to a thing I say, thankfully,” Skirata said. He <em class="calibre6">knew</em> she'd react like that. “So that means there's only <em class="calibre6">one</em> vessel we can't blow up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Priority is to isolate the green truck and ground it before engaging other targets.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that, sir,” a chorus said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik set the speeder down three hundred meters behind the warehouse in a cluster of shuttered wholesalers' units. Skirata sat breathing deeply for a moment to steady himself before opening his comlink again with a double click of his back teeth.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Obrim, this is Skirata.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got you, Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can roll now, my friend. Talk to you later.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that.” Obrim's channel snapped into silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Omega, Delta, all units, this is Kal. We're clear. All yours, Captain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Copy that, Sargeant.” Ordo began counting down. “Five, four, three, two … <em class="calibre6">go go go! Oya!”</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">CoruFresh depot, 2225—H Hour</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">At 2225 hours Triple Zero time, Fi and Mereel broke from behind the low wall at the southern edge of the landing strip and positioned themselves between the parked repulsor trucks at the far side facing the warehouse.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi focused the infrared scope of his DC-17 on the green truck and saw a bright patch of heat on the fuselage. He tilted up and saw the dim patchwork indicating the varying temperatures of a human's upper body, a pilot waiting to depart.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've got a target in the pilot's seat of the green truck, and his drive's showing up warm on the infrared scope. Is the explosive loaded? Can anyone confirm?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can see the rear of the truck. They've closed the hatch with two targets inside as well as the pilot.” Ordo paused. “The green truck is now confirmed as laden. We have to keep that vessel grounded, <em class="calibre6">vode.</em> We can't detonate it, not here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Dar, you got a clear shot at the pilot?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was the sound of fast breathing and a grunt as someone dropped next to him. Fi looked left and saw Darman kneeling on one leg with his Verpine rifle raised, elbow braced on his knee. A Verp slug was guaranteed to punch a hole in the truck's viewscreen and kill the pilot without triggering the five-hundred-grade. “Got him lined up. Standing by.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi swung his Deece to locate Ordo on the roof. He couldn't see Sev, but Ordo's helmet range finder was just visible as he turned his head.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Delta,” Ordo said, “stand by to take the rear of the green truck when we kill the illumigrids. Omega, target all walking targets on the landing strip.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Kal's voice cut in. <em class="calibre6">“Ord</em>'ika—we're at the rear of the warehouse blocking the back doors. Force is estimating twenty-four live targets in all, I'm told.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi refocused his scope on the interior of the warehouse. He could see at least nine men and women scurrying around inside, and two more visible via infrared, ripping open crates and bundling small boxes and blasters into bags. “I've got a minimum of eleven contacts around and inside the warehouse and it looks like they've got a small arsenal in there. Good news is that it's just one big empty space with partitioned offices down one wall.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Once the lights go out, they'll batten down …”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev cut in. “I've got two loading what looks like DC-15 rifle cases into the small red airspeeder on the northern perimeter fence.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Six of the trucks look warm and ticking over in my infrared,” Mereel said. “Can't see any activity in the rest of the speeders. There ought to be four ready to fly.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Hit them <em class="calibre6">all,</em> then, just to be certain,” Ordo said. “Hit everything except the green truck.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm on night vision now,” Darman said. “Ready when you are, Captain Ordo.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Corr sprinted into position to Fi's right, sliding behind a truck, with the rotary blaster braced against his belt and his left hand tight on the top grip. From his stance he looked like a man who felt pretty good about his chances. He wasn't even meant to be a commando; he'd just risen to the challenge.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi hoped Skirata would find a way of permanently absorbing him into Arca Company. He switched to his night scope and aligned the target icon on a man and a woman carrying a flat crate between them toward one of the trucks.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi's finger rested on the trigger.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Lights!” Ordo hissed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He and Sev fired their Plex rocket launchers, and both illumigrids were swallowed simultaneously by two balls of yellow flame.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The roar killed any chances of him hearing the shattering transparisteel viewscreen of the green truck. But he heard Darman an instant later.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Truck pilot, <em class="calibre6">clear!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've lost one!” Jusik said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Say again?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One target's made a run for it, over in the northeast corner. I felt him go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a split second of frozen time before blue blasterfire sprayed from Fi's position, cutting down the two people moving a crate. Two of the trucks exploded in balls of fire, accounting for six more targets. The landing strip was now a dark void lit by the dying flames of two smashed trucks and sporadic bolts of Deece fire. From the far end of the depot the distinctive blue staccato attack of the rotary blaster hosed every vehicle on that side of the strip. Corr was definitely <em class="calibre6">getting stuck in,</em> as <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> put it. He sprinted to Ordo's left, firing as he ran, taking out the last gray-and-silver airspeeder in a ball of white light.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Jusik?” Ordo debated whether to worry about the one escapee. “Jusik, get Vau and Etain onto the one who's bolted.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Beneath Ordo, Boss, Fixer, and Scorch raced to the rear of the green truck, Atin coming in from the other side. Boss fired a stream of bolts from his Deece at a shallow angle, slicing off half the truck's repulsor drive housing. It dropped flat on the ground with a massive crash of crumpling alloy. It definitely wasn't going anywhere now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scorch concentrated his fire into the warehouse. Ordo swung over the edge of the roof to rappel down into the melee, firing one of his twin blasters as he dropped. The shots sparked and smoked off closing doors. There were probably nine or ten terrorists now shut inside with a good supply of weapons. And right now they weren't Ordo's worst problem.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Sev thudded to the ground beside him and rewound his rappelling line. “Two Verp kills. That's all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Two still alive inside the truck,” Boss said. “If you had a hundred kilos of thermal explosive, a lot of dets, and no escape, what would you do?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Take as many of the enemy out with me as I could,” Ordo said. “Storm that <em class="calibre6">dik'utla</em> truck <em class="calibre6">now</em> before they put us into orbit.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Two minutes into the engagement felt like seconds. Fi sprinted down to the green truck on Mereel's heels with Corr, Darman, and Niner close behind.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I make it ten bodies on the landing strip,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“One dead pilot and two live targets in this truck.” Ordo motioned Niner and Scorch to the front of the truck. “You stand by to distract them when Fixer and Boss go in the rear hatch.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo stood back with both blasters drawn as Fixer and Boss stacked either side of the hatch. He fired at the frame mountings and it buckled and burst open. There was a loud <em class="calibre6">pee-eww pee-eww</em> of ricocheting fragments from the front of the vessel and Fixer and Boss burst in with their gauntlet vibroblades drawn.</div>

<div class="paragraph">White lights flared and hissed: hand blasters. Ordo had a split second of thinking <em class="calibre6">This is it, it's going to blow, we're dead, it's over—</em>and then silence fell again. Battles seemed to him a mass of deafening noise interspersed with brief, dead silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fierfek, they didn't even get the dets lined up,” Scorch said. “Amateurs.” He scrambled out of the shattered truck, his armor blackened by blasterfire. Boss jumped out behind him and shook blood off his vibroblade before sheathing it again.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo took a breath. <em class="calibre6">“Kal'buir?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“We're still at the rear doors. It's gone a little quiet in there. <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika</em> says eleven inside.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Confirmed eleven on the infrared scope, too,” said Niner, who always needed to be certain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They've locked themselves in. We're just clearing the explosives out of the truck.” Ordo motioned to Corr, Niner, and Boss to go. “Mereel and I are going in the front doors. Dar and Fi, open up a hole in the south-side wall.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Want us to go in from the back, son?” Skirata said. “I'm pumping adrenaline and I'd like to get in on some action. For old times' sake.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Remember you don't have Katarn armor,” Ordo said, instantly more worried for <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir</em> than anyone alive.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata snorted. “Remember you're not wearing Mandalorian iron.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo gestured to Mereel. His brother brushed a dusting of debris off his blue lieutenant's pauldron and reached over his shoulders with both hands to draw the massive Cip-Quad blaster strapped across his back.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In <em class="calibre6">three … ,”</em> Ordo said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What happened to <em class="calibre6">in five?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I just ran out of patience.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata held up his Verpine in his left hand, knife in his right, listening as Jusik drew his lightsaber, a Jedi Knight in a Mando helmet.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Bard'ika, I'll take that image to my grave.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He checked the infrared targeting beam, more out of nervous habit than anything, and hoped the <em class="calibre6">hut'uune</em> didn't have night vision.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The deafening double trip-hammer of Mereel's quad blaster shattered the brief calm and the rear doors were blown open. There was an explosion and a pounding rain of debris from the side of the warehouse. For a moment Skirata thought the doors had been blown out by the blast but Jusik punched the air as if it was a rather clever touch.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek. So that's the Force, is it?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no light spilling out of the doorway. Then someone inside the warehouse ran for the doors and a grainy figure shot through his night vision display.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata reacted instantly, without thinking, charging at him and smashing into his face with an armored elbow, then bringing his knife up hard under his ribs before he could even fall backward. It was only when he aimed the Verp in his next breath and concentrated on the face in his HUD for a second, that he realized it was the woman who had called him a Mandalorian thug. He fired the gun before he had even thought of a suitable retort. War was like that. You rarely thought of something satisfying to say until days later, if you had anything to say at all.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ten on the infrared,” Niner said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Infrared told you who was still <em class="calibre6">warm.</em> Infrared couldn't tell you who was <em class="calibre6">alive.</em> Skirata preferred to track movement alone.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Grenade! Cover!” Atin yelled.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The shock wave lifted Skirata and left his ears ringing. He was sure he was outside the doors but he was now <em class="calibre6">inside,</em> and Jusik hauled him cleanly to his feet with one arm. He couldn't hear the comlink clearly now.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The rapid hammering of a rotary blaster started up and then stopped abruptly. For a man trained in the delicate art of bomb disposal, Corr had seized on the crude technique of spraying six barrels with some enthusiasm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Grenade—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Another explosion shook the warehouse. “Man down!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Someone was cursing—Sev? Scorch?—and Ordo yelled, “Pull back! Clear the building!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sprinted after Jusik, following the green glow of his lightsaber. As they cleared the doors, a massive <em class="calibre6">whooomp</em> punched Skirata simultaneously under the soles of his feet and in his back. He almost lost his balance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Silence descended. Skirata strained to listen.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Lots of scattered <em class="calibre6">patches</em> of infrared.” That sounded like Niner. “And no idea what's alive and what's just … warm.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Scorch, you okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah. Yeah. Really. Just shook me up.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That's it,” Jusik said. “I'm coming back in, Ordo.” He spun around and ran back into the warehouse. Skirata followed him. “I can find the live ones. Leave it to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The warehouse was now almost in darkness and silent except for the ticking, creaking, and crumbling sounds of settling debris and cooling alloy. The air stank of ozone from discharged blasters and from the animal scent of shattered bodies. Nothing moved.</div>

<div class="paragraph">This was taking hours, Skirata was sure. No, this was <em class="calibre6">minutes.</em> His brain had slipped into the unreal time frame of combat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik's green lightsaber left an eerie trail. He didn't seem afraid of drawing fire: he'd just bat it away like an annoying insect, Skirata was sure. “I can feel three lives.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Well, they’ll know the Jedi are on the case now.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata imagined lying on that floor in the dark silent chaos, probably deafened, certainly injured, catching glimpses of movement as soldiers stalked the room. The commandos had killed their visor lights, and Fi, Atin, and Darman were nearly invisible in their black armor even to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It must have been terrifying. He'd hidden from soldiers, six years old and scared enough to wet his pants.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Now you know what it's like,</em> hut'uune.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Someone made a sound, a little half word, and it sounded like <em class="calibre6">please.</em> Skirata swung his Verpine in the direction of the noise. He saw a man kneeling with hands raised: fierfek, he didn't want to take prisoners. That was the last thing they needed. He heard Jusik swallow hard.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Get over by the wall,” Jusik hissed. He was gesturing at the person who seemed to be surrendering. Could the <em class="calibre6">hut'uun</em> even see the Jedi? “Get over by the wall!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Then Darman's voice cut in. “Sarge! <em class="calibre6">Down!</em> Flame—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata swung around and dropped to his knees just as Jusik ducked a sheet of white-hot, roaring liquid flame that lit up the shattered warehouse and overwhelmed his night vision for a split second. It pumped out in shallow arcs and Darman took it full on. Commandos and troopers leaped back instinctively and Skirata felt the heat even through a layer of ancient Mandalorian iron. Darman was illuminated like a jet black statue, rifle still raised, enveloped in blazing liquid. He didn't even scream.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Dar!”</em> Skirata found his body responding without intervention from his brain as he pumped Verpine rounds in the direction of the flamethrower. Someone fell. The stream of fire stopped. The <em class="calibre6">thunk</em> of a power cell being slapped onto a blaster diverted him from the terrible spectacle of Darman burning like a torch as someone—Fi? Niner?—rushed to roll their brother on the ground in a bid to smother the flames. Skirata caught the faint light of a charge indicator in his peripheral vision and swung the Verpine in its direction, but Jusik waded in instantly, swinging his lightsaber in a blur of light. Skirata could now see that the kneeling man—the apparently <em class="calibre6">surrendering</em> man—had drawn a blaster. It was still clutched in his limp hand. For some reason that feint angered Skirata more than anything.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“All clear!” Jusik yelled. <em class="calibre6">“Dar!”</em> He looked up at the ceiling. “Hang on, Dar.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Katarn armor could withstand high temperatures but the burning chemical had coated Darman's plates. It was resisting attempts by Niner and Sev to smother it with bundles of sacking they had grabbed. Skirata went to throw his jacket over him. Suddenly a fine sticky rain filled the air.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The fire control system had kicked in.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm glad that worked,” Jusik muttered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A white cloud of hissing gas enveloped Darman and the warehouse plunged back into darkness. The blaze was out; fire retardant rained from the ceiling.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata squatted over Darman, edging Niner and Ordo out of the way. His armor was still radiating heat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Son! Are you okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sarge—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you hurt?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not really … made me blink a bit, though. That liquid's <em class="calibre6">nasty</em> stuff.” Darman's plates were hissing audibly as they cooled. His voice was shaky. “Thanks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is this your handiwork, <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika?”</em> Skirata helped Darman to his feet. His plates were hot to the touch. “Did you activate the fire system?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not just good for blowing stuff up.” Jusik picked his way through the rubble and shattered durasteel, boots crunching, then stopped dead. “That's it,” he said quietly. “Definitely nobody left alive.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The kid seemed remarkably calm about it, or at least his voice was under control. Darman dusted himself down and Ordo handed him his Deece. Eight helmet spotlamps flared into life and swept the interior, highlighting a scene of smoking wallboard and things Skirata had seen far too much of on too many battlefields. One beam jerked up toward the roof.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We blew the <em class="calibre6">shabla</em> roof half off,” Boss said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Last time I rely on infrared …”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kandosii, Bard'ika!</em> He's better than a scope any day.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is this it?” That was Fixer's voice. “All that, and <em class="calibre6">still</em> we don't get to see them? At least you can see droids. They come at you. These scum—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You want to look, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're just so … ordinary.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And now they're so <em class="calibre6">dead,”</em> said Sev.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo cut in. “We're done here, <em class="calibre6">vode.</em> Time to go.” He put his gloved hand on Skirata's shoulder. “Nine minutes, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> Could have been faster, but it's done. Let's go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata caught Darman's arm and followed Jusik. <em class="calibre6">I can still fight: I'm still pretty good.</em> But he wasn't as good as young men at the peak of their abilities, and he needed to do something about that if he wasn't going to be a liability to them one day.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd worry about that later, like his ankle. Now they had to wait on Vati and Etain, who were still out hunting.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Quadrant F-76, somewhere north of the CoruFresh depot, 2305 hours, 385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The strill was a little bright light of pure joy as it raced along the walkway ahead of Etain and Vau. There were still a few pedestrians around, leaving factories and workshops for the night, and Vau had taken off his helmet. A dull black armored chest plate didn't attract attention, it seemed, but this wasn't a neighborhood where a distinctive Mandalorian visor would pass unnoticed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill had the man's scent. He had a head start on them but Mird was not to be shaken off, and Etain could follow the trail of panic and fear almost as well as the animal could. She could locate the area: Mird could track by scent once she had narrowed down a search zone for it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">This is a strange thing for a pregnant woman to be doing. Can my son sense whats happening around him yet? I hope not.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau kept close behind her, jogging at a steady pace.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm very impressed,” he panted. “You and the strill work very well together. I do wish Kal could see this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain imagined this was how Vau hunted with Mird, silent and persistent, covering the ground hour after hour until they had cornered their prey or run it down. The man who had managed to flee the attack on the landing strip had led them into a maze of run-down apartment towers on the edge of the industrial zone.</div>

<div class="paragraph">After a while Etain caught up with Mird and found it crouched impatiently by a set of doors leading into a shabby residential building. A couple of unpleasant-looking youths lounging on the corner of the walkway began ambling toward her, leering, but then Mird opened its huge maw and let out a warning rumble. Vau appeared around the corner, the Verpine rifle raised in one hand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The youths fled.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And they say young people today have no intelligence,” Vau said. He took a hand disrupter out of his belt and thrust it into the door panel. The doors parted. “In you go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird raced ahead and skidded to a halt at the turbolift, turning its head to gaze pleadingly at its master. Vau put a finger to his lips and pointed up. They got in the turbolift and the strill pressed its nose to the small gap between the doors as the car ascended. As they passed the 134th and 135th floors, it grew frantic and its tail thrashed the floor, but it didn't make a sound. Vau stopped the lift at the 136th floor and they got out. There was an emergency staircase between floors. Etain broke the seal with a Force-assisted push and started down the stairs.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Oya,</em> Mird! Hunt!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird shot past her. She could feel the disturbance in the Force, and their respective instincts took them both to the 134th floor. Mird snuffled along the passage and came to a halt outside an apartment door, settled on its haunches, and stared intently at the door panel.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau put a restraining hand on her arm. “I know a Mandalorian regards a female warrior as his equal, my dear, but I feel I should offer to do this job myself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll do it,” she said. She had to.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau disrupted the lock. The strill ran into the hallway, almost flat to the floor, and Etain followed it, drawing both lightsabers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It occurred to her that she might have stumbled upon a family here, and then been presented with a dilemma: a Jedi with two drawn lightsabers, a room full of witnesses, and a cowering terrorist. <em class="calibre6">What would I do? What</em> will <em class="calibre6">I do?</em> But she sensed that would not be the case. It was just another fear of how far she might be prepared to go.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She burst open each door with the Force, moving at a slight crouch, looking inside.</div>

<div class="paragraph">A stream of blasterfire spat out of one door and caught the strill on its quarters. Etain heard Vau gasp. Mird shrieked and spun around, one leg dragging, and then made to go in after its assailant, but she held out one arm and it stopped dead.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Leave, Mird!” she whispered.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain took a breath then stepped into the room to meet another hail of blasterfire. She crossed the blue blades of energy and batted the bolts aside with a parting motion of her arms. <em class="calibre6">I didn't know I could do that.</em> It was pure instinct, drawn from deep within her and many years in the past.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She lunged forward for the kill. As always, she saw little and felt nothing tangible, no shock up her arms, no resistance as she swept the blades, but she felt the Force change. A brief light blazed and died.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She thumbed off Master Fuller's lightsaber and slid it into her tunic one-handed while keeping her own drawn just in case. She sensed nobody else. Mird limped into the room after her and she knew it was looking up into her face even though there was only the scattered light through the window from a city that was never completely dark.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Oya,”</em> she whispered, not knowing quite what the command might mean in this case.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Mird rumbled quietly and sprang onto the body of the man she had killed. She shut down her lightsaber and walked out of the apartment, and Mird limped out a few moments later, crunching happily. She didn't look too closely at what it had in its jaws. It swallowed noisily.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Poor Mird.” Vau sighed. “Here, baby, come here.” He scooped the strill up in both arms and carried it to the turbo-lift. One of its legs had been seared raw by the blaster.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain opened her comlink. “Kal, everyone is accounted for.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good work,” Kars voice said. He sounded tired. “See you at the RV point.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mird let Etain place her hands on its leg to heal it as the lift made its way down to the ground floor. Vau carried it all the way back to the speeder. It was a big, heavy animal, but he refused to let it walk. Etain took it on her lap and eased its pain as Vau started the speeder and they headed for the RV point.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There seemed to be nothing Vau wouldn't do for Mird. He loved that animal.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">RV point, two kilometers from CoruFresh depot, 2320 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">385 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The strike team rendezvoused at a droid-operated construction site to the north of the depot. The droids needed no light to work by and the presence of a few strangely dressed humanoids in the near darkness would draw no attention.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata counted the six speeders back in, gut churning until the last of the speeders arrived with Mereel and Corr astride. Corr was clutching the rotary blaster like a long-lost friend.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Good lad. I'll shift Coruscant and all its rotten moons to hang on to him, Zey. We can always train more troopers as commandos. Just watch me.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“All thermal plastoid accounted for?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sarge.” Boss leaned against the bodywork of a speeder. “Want to check?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I trust you to count. Ordo can slip that back into stores tomorrow after it's been neutralized.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's the final score?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Niner eased off his helmet. Even with the environment control inside his sealed suit, he looked as if he'd sweated out an ocean. He rubbed his face slowly with the palm of his glove. “Er … I think we took out twenty-six bad guys.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Twenty-four at the site,” Mereel said. “We swept the site and did a tally. It was a bit hard to tell in some places but we logged the blasters that had been fired by their EM traces. So I say twenty-four.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Plus Perrive and our friend in the apartment block,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Definitely twenty-six.” Jusik was subdued. “I felt them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, Shiny Boys twenty-six, <em class="calibre6">Hut'uune</em> nil,” Corr said. He was picking up <em class="calibre6">Mando' a</em> fast. “I call that a home win.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik stood staring into the inside of his helmet as he held it in his hands. “No witnesses left standing. Just a nasty argument between crime gangs.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You'll never get any public praise for this,” Skirata said. “But let me tell you now that every last one of you made me a proud man.” He looked down at the strill, limping on one of its six legs as it circled Vau, grumbling deep in its throat. “Even you, Mird, you stinking heap of drool.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The strill looked up at Etain and made a musical warbling sound. She'd wrapped one arm around Darman's waist, head resting on his chest plate with her eyes closed, but she opened them and watched Mird.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mird likes you,” Vau said. “You took care of it and let it have its kill.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi gave Darman a weary slap on the back. “She has a way with dumb animals, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">An exhausted silence settled on the team. The droids labored around them, carrying girders, stacking duraplast sheets, oblivious. If anyone thought wild celebrations followed operations like this, they were wrong. The instant elation of seeing a vessel go up in flames or an enemy drop from a well-placed shot was very short-lived. The hyperalertness of adrenaline lingered for a while, and then was swallowed up quickly by fatigue and a sense of … of <em class="calibre6">void,</em> of odd purposelessness, of looking for the next task.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The adrenaline had to drain away. They'd be back to normal after some rest. Skirata was determined they'd get some.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Let's get back to base,” he said. “We can clear out of Qibbu's in the morning.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He got no response.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Anyone hungry? Maybe an ale or two?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“ 'Freshers,” Niner said. “Shower.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Who's on watch roster tonight?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Me,” Vau said before Skirata could open his mouth. “Go on, Bardan. You head back with Etain and Mird. I'll take Kal.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata hauled himself onto Vau's speeder. The painkiller was wearing off and the ache had started gnawing his ankle again. He opened his comlink and called Jailer Obrim.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal here. How's it going?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim sounded as if he was in the middle of a riot. There was a lot of shouting in the background and then a loud muffled <em class="calibre6">whump.</em> Commandos weren't the only ones who laid charges for a spot of rapid entry, then.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Busy,” said the CSF captain. “We've pulled in around sixty suspects so far. Pretty low on the food chain, but they lead to all kinds of other people CSF has an interest in, and they're off the streets for a while.” He paused as another loud <em class="calibre6">whuntp</em> interrupted. “I don't know where we're going to put them all, though. The lockup is filling fast.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Never had that problem. Our targets don't get out on parole, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll bet. You all okay?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No serious injury. Everyone's walking. Quite a mess for you to clear up, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My pleasure. CSF Staff and Social Club, <em class="calibre6">all</em> of you. End of the week. I will <em class="calibre6">not</em> take no for an answer and neither will CSF. Be there.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Count on it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata closed the link and let his head drop so that his chin rested on his chest plate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau squeezed into the seat in front of him and powered up the speeder. He reached behind him and passed Skirata a datapad. “Perrive's pad. Enjoy its contents at your leisure, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.</em> So, a drink or a fight? What's it to be?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Walon, you're very lucky I'm too tired.” Skirata pocketed the datapad, another little treasure trove for his Null boys to play with. “I'd just slap you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I need to make my peace with Atin.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He'll still kill you after he's had a good night's sleep.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The brief unity of triumph, and then back to the fray. Crushing, isn't it? The victories seem so insignificant compared with the size of the war.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Doesn't mean we shouldn't try,” Skirata said. “It's only what individuals do that adds up to history.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We've written ours, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was one of the few times that Skirata found himself staring at Vau's back without feeling the urge to reach for his knife. “Tell you what,” he said. He took out the disabled remote det from his pocket. “Why don't we swing by the diplomatic quarter and pick up that nice green speeder? Perrive's not going to need it now. Can you still hotwire a speeder?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You bet,” said Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi stepped over stacked piles of armor and packs of five hundred-grade plastoid explosive and flopped into the first chair he found.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You going to sleep in that bucket?” Mereel said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi took the hint and popped his helmet seal, inhaling warm air scented with sweat, stale carpet, caf, and strill. There were times when the <em class="calibre6">buy'ce</em> was a comfort and a quiet haven, insulating him from the world, and he felt in need of that now for reasons he didn't understand or want to think about.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel sat at the scratched, battered table unwrapping packs of thermal plastoid and working a colorless liquid into them. Fi wanted to get up and look but he was simply too tired. He could see Mereel pressing a hollow into the cakes of brown plastoid with his thumb, pouring in a few drops of the liquid from a small bottle, and then kneading it in with a steady folding motion.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah,” Fi said, remembering.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Got to add the stabilizer compound before we put it back into stores or else this is going to kill a lot more <em class="calibre6">vode</em> than the bad guys ever could.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Want a hand?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. Get some sleep.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Where's Sergeant Kal?” Fi had quite enjoyed calling him <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> But he donned old habits along with his armor. “I hope he hasn't knifed Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They're liberating a speeder on behalf of the Skirata Retirement Fund.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Come on, he'll never retire.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He still wants the speeder. Merc habits die hard.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi found it hard to think of his sergeant as having any interest in a life beyond the army. He spent a while wondering what the man might really want, and apart from a wife to look after him, Fi had problems imagining what that might be. It was the same problem he had with his own dreams. They were intrusive and insistent—but they were limited. He only knew there was something missing, and when he looked at Darman and Etain, he knew what it was; he also wondered how it could work out even if he got it. He wasn't stupid. He could count and calculate odds of survival.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good night, <em class="calibre6">ner vod.”</em> He left Mereel to his task and wandered around, unclipping his armor plates as he went and stacking them in a pile by the bedroom door. Black bodysuits and briefs hung drying on every peg and rail. However exhausted they were, the squads still washed their kit conscientiously.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi glanced into some of the rooms to check who might be awake and willing to chat, but the Delta boys were all out cold, not even snoring. Niner and Corr slumped in chairs in one of the alcoves with a plate of half-eaten cookies sitting on the small table between them. Darman was stretched out on his bed in the room he shared with Fi, apparently none the worse for his ordeal, and Ordo was curled up in the next room with a blanket pulled over his head. Odd: he always seemed to do that, as if he wanted total darkness.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no sign of Jusik or Etain. Farther along the passage, Fi struck lucky. Atin was sitting in the chair in his room, cleaning his armor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm on watch until Skirata gets back,” he said, without waiting for Fi's question.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's wrong?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nothing.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sure Laseema will wait for you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's not about Laseema.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So it's <em class="calibre6">something.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You never give up, do you?” Atin had always been the private type, even though he'd settled into a very different squad culture from the one he'd been raised in. There was always something new to learn about a brother who'd been trained in another batch. “Okay, now that the job's done, I've got matters to address with Sergeant Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's not a sergeant any longer.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm still going to kill him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was just talk. Men said things like that. Fi closed the doors and sat down on the bed opposite.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm supposed to be on watch,” Atin said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I made Sev tell me how you got the wound to your face.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So now you know. Vau gave me a good hiding for being whiny about surviving Geonosis when my brothers didn't.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's even more than that. You know it. You wouldn't be the first commando to get in a fistfight with his sergeant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You know, I like you better when you're being mindless and funny.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We need to know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Usen'ye.”</em> It was the crudest way to tell someone to go away in <em class="calibre6">Mando'a.</em> “It's none of your business.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It is if you pick a fight with Vau, and he kills <em class="calibre6">you</em> and we have to get a replacement.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin laid the back plate he was cleaning on the floor and rubbed his eyes. “You want to know? Really? Look.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He hooked his fingers inside the neck of his bodysuit and jerked down the front panel. The gription seams yielded. It was nothing Fi hadn't seen before in the refreshers: Atin's shoulders and arms were laced with long white streaks of scar tissue. It was common in the GAR. Men got injured in training and in the field, armor or not. But Atin seemed to have acquired more spectacular ones than average.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Scars happened, especially if you didn't get bacta on a wound fast enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau gave you those, too, didn't he?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Vau nearly killed me, so when I finally got out of the bacta tank, I said I'd kill <em class="calibre6">him</em> one day. Fair enough, yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">No wonder Corr said he found commandos a little “relaxed.” They must have seemed dangerously chaotic to a clone trooper raised and trained by sober Kaminoan flash-instruction and simulation.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kill</em> is a bit strong,” Fi said. “Break his nose, maybe.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Skirata did that already. Look, if Vau felt you lacked the killer edge, he'd crank it up a little. He'd make you fight your brother. We had a choice. We could fight each other until one was too badly hurt to stand up, or we could fight <em class="calibre6">him.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi thought of Kal Skirata, as hard and ruthless as anyone he had ever known, making sure his squads were fed and well rested, finding illicit treats for them, teaching them, encouraging them, telling them how proud they made him. It seemed to work pretty well.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And?” said Fi.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I opted to take on Vau. He had a real <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> iron saber, and I was unarmed. I just went at him. I never wanted to kill so badly in my life and he just cut me up. And Skirata beat the <em class="calibre6">osik</em> out of Vau when he found out. They never did get on, those two.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So … the thing with Sev. You told Skirata.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, Skirata just found out. I didn't even know he knew me until we met at the spaceport siege.” Atin picked up his plate and started cleaning it again. “So now you know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi thought that a quick swing at Vau might purge Atin's hatred. Then it occurred to him that his brother was absolutely literal.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“At'ika,</em> ever thought what's going to happen to you if you <em class="calibre6">do</em> kill him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've killed people outside my legitimate rules of engagement tonight. One more won't make a difference. And I'll die soon enough anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, but there's Laseema.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin paused, cloth gripped in one hand. “Yes, there is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And how <em class="calibre6">are</em> you going to kill Vau anyway?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“With a blade.” He picked up his right gauntlet and ejected the blade with a loud <em class="calibre6">shunk.</em> “The <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> way.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">This isn't bravado.</em> Fi struggled for a moment, wondering what the right thing to do might be. <em class="calibre6">He's really going to do it.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi decided he'd wait near the doors to the landing platform, ready for the moment that Vau walked through them.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Etain found sleep impossible. She sat out on the landing platform with Jusik, meditating. For all the violence of the day she had put behind her, she found a serene core within her that had never been there before, the inner calm she had sought so many years through study and struggle.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">All I had to do was have a life beside my own to care for. That is the true detachment we ought to seek, putting another person above ourselves—not denying our emotions. The attachment to</em> self <em class="calibre6">is the path to the dark side.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The intricate silver threads of her child in the Force were more complex now, more interconnected. She sensed purpose and clarity and passion. He would be an extraordinary person. She could hardly wait to get to know him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And when it was the right time, she would explain what she sensed to Darman. She imagined the joy on his face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She brought herself out of the trance and Jusik was standing a few meters away, looking out over the ravine of towers in the direction of the Senate.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Bardan, I have a question I can only ask of you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He turned and smiled. “I'll answer if I can.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How do I tell Darman in Mandalorian that I love him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She waited for Jusik to express some shock or disapproval. He blinked a few times, focusing on a nonexistent spot a few meters ahead. “I don't think he's completely fluent in <em class="calibre6">Mando'a.</em> The Nulls are, though.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I don't want to declare my love for Ordo, thanks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay. Try … <em class="calibre6">ni kar'tayli gar darasuum.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She repeated it under her breath a few times. “Got it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's the same word as 'to know,' 'to hold in the heart,' <em class="calibre6">kar'taylir.</em> But you add <em class="calibre6">darasuum,</em> forever, and it becomes something rather different.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That tells me a great deal about the Mandalorian view of relationships.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They believe that complete knowledge of someone is the key to loving them. They don't like surprises and hidden facets. Warriors tend not to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Pragmatic people.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“A pity we Jedi weren't better friends with them, then. We could enjoy being pragmatic together.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You haven't lectured me on attachment. Thank you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik turned to her with a broad smile that could only have come from being at complete peace with himself. He indicated his body with a flourish of his hands: dull green Mandalorian armor in the form of body plates and greaves. The matching helmet with its sinister T-shaped slit in the visor stood on the floor beside him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You think,” he said, “that I'll be walking back into the Jedi Temple wearing this? You think this isn't attachment?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He really did find it funny. He laughed. The two of them were everything the Jedi Order wouldn't approve of. “Zey would throw a fit.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kenobi wears trooper armor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“General Kenobi does <em class="calibre6">not</em> speak Mandalorian.” She found Jusik's laughter infectious, and tinged with the exhaustion and frightened relief that was often so evident in Fi. “And his soldiers don't address him as <em class="calibre6">Little Obi-Wan.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik became sober again. “Our code was written when we were peacekeepers. We've never fought a war, not like this, not using others. And that changes everything. So I shall remain <em class="calibre6">attached,</em> because my heart tells me it's <em class="calibre6">right.</em> If remaining a Jedi means that is incompatible, then I know the choice I'll make.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've made it,” Etain said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And so have you.” He made a vague gesture in the direction of her belly. “I can sense as much. I know you too well now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Don't.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“This is going to be very difficult for both of you, Etain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Darman doesn't know yet. You're not to mention it to <em class="calibre6">anyone.</em> Promise me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Of course I won't. I owe Darman a great deal. All of the men, in fact.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You're going to kill yourself trying to live up to them.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then that's fine by me,” said Jusik.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik didn't want to be a peacemaker. If the Force hadn't manifested itself in him, he could have been a scientist, an engineer, a builder of astonishing things. But he wanted to be a soldier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And Etain had to be one, too, whether she wanted to or not, because her troops needed her to be one. But as soon as the war was over, she would leave the Jedi Order and follow a harder but sweeter destiny.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata set the green speeder down on the landing platform with a certain amount of satisfaction. He'd get Enacca to change the color and make it disappear from the licensing system, but that was routine work for her. She was furious at having to pick up so many of the team's speeders, sometimes abandoned when they had no choice, but a few extra credits would soothe her.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau eased out of the hatch on the passenger's side and Mird loped up to him, rumbling and whining happily.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm going to treat myself to a glass of <em class="calibre6">tihaar,”</em> Skirata said. “If the strill wants to sleep inside tonight, it's welcome.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I might join you in that drink.” Vau scooped Mird, up in his arms again. “Not a textbook operation by any means, but the men put a decent dent in the opposition in a very short time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It almost felt like a civilized relationship. It felt that way right up to the moment the doors opened and they almost stumbled over Fi. He held out both arms as a barrier.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sarge, Atin's in a foul mood.” He turned to Vau, who set Mird down on the carpet and removed his helmet. “I don't think you should go near him, Sergeant Vau.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau just lowered his chin slightly and looked resigned. “Let's get it over with.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Fi, this is between me and him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's immediate instinct was to intervene, but this time he suspected Vau would come off worse, and that had a certain sense of justice to it. While he respected the man's skill and integrity, he loathed him at a gut level for his brutality. And for him, that erased all the virtues in Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He said he did it for their own good: it was to reinforce their <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> identity, to save their lives, to save their souls. His lads even believed it. Skirata never would.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've been waiting, Sarge,” said Atin's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata pulled Fi back. Ordo and Mereel, still working on neutralizing the booby-trapped thermal plastoid, looked up, wary, waiting for his signal to get involved. He gave them a discreet shake of the head. <em class="calibre6">Not yet.</em> Leave it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin wore his right gauntlet and his bodysuit. He extended the vibroblade from the knuckle plate and held his fist up at his shoulder, then sheathed the blade.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If that strill starts on me, I'll take it out, too.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a side of Atin that Skirata had never seen before, but one that Vau had built. It was the little bit of Jango, the gene that said <em class="calibre6">Stand and fight, don't run,</em> another genetic tendency that could be nurtured and developed and trained into something much bigger than itself.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau held his arms at his sides and looked genuinely frustrated. Atin never understood why he'd done it. <em class="calibre6">And neither did I,</em> Skirata thought. <em class="calibre6">You save a man from being</em> dar'manda <em class="calibre6">by teaching him his heritage, not by making him into a wild animal.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau's voice had softened. “You had to be <em class="calibre6">Mando,</em> Atin. If I didn't make you <em class="calibre6">Mando,</em> you might as well have been dead, because you wouldn't exist as a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad,</em> not without your spirit and your guts.” He was <em class="calibre6">almost</em> apologetic. “You had to be able to cross that threshold and be ready to do absolutely <em class="calibre6">anything</em> to win. Fierfek, if stupid Jedi hadn't used you as infantry on Geonosis, every single one of my commando batch would be alive today. I made you hard men because I <em class="calibre6">cared.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was glad Vau didn't use the word <em class="calibre6">love.</em> He'd have put his own knife in the man's guts if he had. He stood clear, hauling Fi away by his arm, and Atin surged forward to seize Vau by his shoulder plates and head-butt him. Vau staggered back a few steps, blood pouring from his nose, but didn't go down. Mird squealed frantically and went to defend its master but Vau sent it back with a hand command.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Udesii,</em> Mird. I can handle this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, handle <em class="calibre6">this,”</em> Atin said, and swung a punch.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was hard to fight a man in Mandalorian armor but Atin, true to his name, was going to do it. His blow caught Vau just below the eye and he followed up with a ferocious lunge to slam him against the wall and press his arm across his throat. Vau reverted to animal instinct and brought his knee up in Atin's gut, driving him far enough back to smash his elbow into his face.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Do I stop this? Can I?</em> Skirata stood ready.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The blow stopped Atin for a few seconds. Then he just came straight back at Vau and charged into him, knocking him flat and pinning him to the floor, pounding away at him with his fists, hitting armor as often as flesh. By this time the noise of bodies and the still's squeals of protest had woken people and Jusik came running just as Atin ejected his vibroblade with a sickening <em class="calibre6">shunk</em> and had it raised, elbow held high, to punch it into Vau's exposed neck.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The two men flew apart as if in a silent explosion. Atin cannoned into the table and Vau was rolled back against the wall. There was a stunned moment of silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“This stops now!” Jusik yelled at the top of his voice. “That is an <em class="calibre6">order!</em> I am your general and I will <em class="calibre6">not</em> tolerate brawling, do you hear? Not for any reason. Get up, the two of you!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau obeyed as meekly as any new recruit. The two men struggled to their feet and Atin stood to attention out of long habit. Little Jusik—hair sleep-tousled, wearing just a crumpled tunic and rough pants—stood glaring at the two much bigger men.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had never seen the Force used to break up a fight before. It was as impressive as ripping open that door.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want this feud to stop now,” Jusik continued, voice barely a whisper. “We have to have <em class="calibre6">discipline.</em> And I can't let you harm each other. We <em class="calibre6">have</em> to be united. Do you understand?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes sir,” Atin said impassively, blood streaked across his face. “Am I on a charge now, General?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. I'm just asking you to put an end to this for all our sakes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Atin was calm reason once again. He didn't even seem out of breath. “Very good, sir.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Vau looked shaken, or at least as shaken as a man like him could be. “I'm a civilian, General, so I can do as I please, but I apologize to my former trainee for any pain I caused him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata winced. It was enough to start the fight again. But it was as good a concession as anyone would ever get out of a man who believed he had done Atin a favor.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“My fault, sir,” Skirata said, doing what a good sergeant should. “I ought to maintain better discipline.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik gave him a look that said he didn't believe that, but it was fond rather than censorious. Skirata hoped he never had to show the lad that he wouldn't obey him, but he suspected Jusik would never want to test that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Jedi glanced over his shoulder at the silent audience that had gathered. “We can all get back to bed now.” The commandos shrugged and disappeared back to their rooms. Corr's expression of total shock was fascinating. There was no sign of Darman. “And you, Fi. It's been a heavy day.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Jusik grabbed a bacta spray with an expression of weary exasperation and sat Atin down in a chair to clean up his face. He made no attempt to tend to Vau, who walked off to the refreshers, Mird whining at his heels. Ordo and Mereel vanished to the landing platform with bundles of wrapped explosives.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata waited for Jusik to finish and for Atin to return to his room.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So, no lightsaber and no armor.” Jusik was even shorter than he was. He prodded the kid in the chest. “I told you that it's what's <em class="calibre6">under</em> the armor that makes a man. A few thousand Jedi like you and the Republic wouldn't be in the <em class="calibre6">osik</em> it is now. You're a soldier, sir, and a good officer. And I don't think I've ever said that to anyone in my life.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata meant it at that moment. It didn't make him love Jedi as a kind any the better, but he was very fond of <em class="calibre6">Bard'ika,</em> and would look after him. Jusik lowered his eyes, a strange blend of embarrassment and delight, and clasped Skirata's arm.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I want what's best for my men, that's all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata waited for him to shut his bedroom doors and went in search of the bottle of <em class="calibre6">tihaar</em> and that rarest of things in Qibbu's Hut, a clean glass. He wrenched the stopper out of the bottle and slopped a little into a chipped goblet.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He couldn't identify which fruit it had been distilled from this time, and it didn't taste that good. It never had, but more often than not it got him to sleep. He let it burn the inside of his mouth before swallowing and sat in the chair, nursing the glass in his cupped hands, eyes closed.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">I hope Atin's found some kind of peace from this.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He thought he detected a faint hint of jewel-fruit in the <em class="calibre6">tihaar.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Four million credits.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">That was satisfying, far more than any bounty or fee he had invested over the years on Aargau. Nobody had mentioned it. Ordo and Mereel certainly had to be thinking about it: they knew his plans. Vau was a mercenary but would not interfere, because he had been paid. Etain might ask questions, too. But the commando squads had little interest in the realities of economics. Clones didn't get paid. They never coveted possessions because they had been raised with nothing to call their own. Even Fi's desire for Ghez Hokan's fine <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> armor and his lads' general lust for Verpine rifles was a blend of pragmatism and the Mandalorian cultural values that he had taught them himself, not basic civilian greed.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And a copy of a restricted Treasury datapad to play with.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">And Perrive's 'pad to pick over I'll have Mereel copy it before I give it to Zey … or give most of it to him, anyway.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He opened his eyes, aware of someone standing over him. Ordo and Mereel stood impatient and excited, looking much more like normal young men having a lark than efficient, disciplined, deadly soldiers.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Mereel grinned, unable to contain his glee. “Want to hear about Ko Sai, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir?</em> She's turned up again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata drained the glass. <em class="calibre6">This</em> was what he wanted most. “I'm all ears, <em class="calibre6">adi'ke.”</em></div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_27" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36429298" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36429299" class="calibre8"></a>24 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph">A <em class="calibre6">major terrorist network lies in tatters this morning following the end of a massive overnight operation by Coruscant Security Forces. A total of ninety-seven suspects were detained or killed, and what's described as “a significant amount” of explosives seized. Senator Ihu Niopua described it as a magnificent piece of police work and praised officers.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–HNE evening news, 387 days after Geonosis</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Coruscant Security Force Staff and Social Club, 2000 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">388 days after Geonosis: ATU and OCU reception for men and </strong><strong class="calibre11">guests of Arca Company, Special Operations Brigade</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">CSF didn't know how brave they'd been until they heard it on the HNE bulletin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi decided to treat the coverage as funny rather than as another case of his brothers' efforts going unrecognized. Skirata had warned him that all special forces personnel had to deal with that, clone or not, so it was nothing personal.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Anyway, it didn't matter. He was leaning on a bar—a clean bar, one that didn't leave your elbows soaking wet—surrounded by people who weren't criminals; unless you counted Sergeant Kal, of course, and he was a special case, because extreme bounty hunting wasn't <em class="calibre6">really</em> a crime. And police officers were buying him drinks and shaking his hand, telling him that their buddies would all have been ground nerf if he hadn't thrown himself on that grenade during the spaceport siege. It was amazing how they still remembered that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi didn't have the heart to tell them that he simply did what years of training had made his body do involuntarily, and that he didn't know how to do anything else. He simply grinned and enjoyed the adulation. He liked the comradeship.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Some of them were female officers, too. They were fascinated by his armor. He enjoyed explaining the parts and functions to them, and wondered why they giggled when he told them how easy it was to take off.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wandered in with Obrim and joined Fi at the bar. Obrim handed them both a glass of a light-colored ale, instantly another brother in uniform with a tacit understanding of how things were.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I see they've upgraded your armor again,” he said, tapping Fi's breastplate with the knuckle of his forefinger. “Different finish. Classy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, they have to try the new kit out on someone, and we're just so <em class="calibre6">stylish.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I suppose they can afford to, now that there's fewer of you left to kit out,” Obrim said, falling into the grim cynicism of men used to being at the mercy of accountants. “Because body bags are a lot cheaper.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What body bags?” Fi said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Really?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Not the <em class="calibre6">Mando way.</em> Or the Republic's.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kriffing tightwads.” Obrim sighed irritably. Then he indicated Mereel, who was surrounded by a small knot of officers plus Delta Squad, laughing noisily. “I see your brother is teaching our boys some bad <em class="calibre6">Mando'a</em> words. Is it true you don't have a word for 'hero'?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, but we've got a dozen for 'stab.'”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim almost laughed. “And how many for frying someone with a blaster?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Loads,” said Fi. “We don't know much about art, but we know what we like.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo was scanning the crowded bar with a faint frown. Fi followed his gaze. He wondered if he was checking where Etain and Jusik were, because Jedi didn't fit easily into the raucous atmosphere of a police social club, but there was Jusik, all smiles, engaged in an intense conversation with two Sullustan forensics officers. Darman was deep in discussion with Corr and a couple of men Fi recognized as CSF bomb disposal experts from the spaceport siege. Niner and Boss seemed to have been drawn into a strange game with some other officers that involved throwing a knife at the fine wooden carvings above the bar, much to the annoyance of the service droid.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And Atin had Laseema on his arm, gazing at him adoringly, even if he did still have a striking black eye from his fight with Vau.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But no Etain, and no Vau. Vau had gone off on another job—unspecified, of course. Darman was still here, though, and that meant Etain was, too, for the time being.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo seemed to be concentrating on the doorway.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What's your problem, <em class="calibre6">ner vod?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Agent Wennen said she would come,” Ordo said. He looked uncharacteristically awkward, seeming for once as if he didn't know what to do next. “I'll have a look around. It's a big bar.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim watched him go. “Fi,” he said, “do you mind me asking you something personal?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I always try to help police with their inquiries, Captain.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Seriously, son. Kal talks to me about you all. I never knew how you were … bred for all this. Sorry. I can't find another word for it. You don't seem to resent it at all. I'd be furious. Aren't you angry? Not just a little?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi wished Obrim didn't make him think. In a way it was much, much simpler on Kamino. It was also easier being alone with only your squad for company on some <em class="calibre6">osik'la</em> planet blowing up droids. There was a clean focus in that. Coruscant had indeed been the hardest battlefield of all, as Sergeant Kal had warned him. But that wasn't because it was rife with the dangers of not knowing if the enemy was standing right next to you. It was because it showed him what he could never have.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've done a lot of thinking in the past year,” Fi said. “Yes, there's plenty wrong. I <em class="calibre6">know</em> I deserve more than this. I want a nice girl and a life and I <em class="calibre6">don't want to die.</em> And I know I'm being used, thanks. But I'm a soldier, and I'm also Mandalorian, and my strength is always going to be what I carry around inside me, my sense of who and what I am. Even if the rest of the galaxy sinks in its own filth, I'll die without compromising my honor.” He drained his glass and started on the next one that was lined up on the bar. He wasn't that fond of the taste, but he believed in being polite. “That's what keeps me going. That, and my brothers. And that ale you promised me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I had to ask.” Obrim frowned quickly and looked away for a moment. “Did that drink really keep you going?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He thought of the insertion into Fest months before. “Yeah, Captain. Sometimes it did.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi dreaded where the conversation might take him but he was interrupted by a loud cheer from farther down the bar. Skirata had arrived and was demonstrating his skill in the knife-throwing game. He let fly with his vicious three-sided knife, knocking the other knives out of the woodwork time after time. The bar droid protested.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's way too good at that,” Obrim said, and turned to Fi again to resume the conversation. “Now, about this—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi didn't want to discuss it anymore. He straightened up and called across the bar to Skirata. “Sarge? Sarge! Want to show 'em the <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a whoop of <em class="calibre6">“Kandosii!”</em> from the squads. “Yeah, come on, Sarge! Let's show them how it's done!”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm too old,” Skirata said, retrieving his knife.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nah,” Fi said, and seized the chance to drag Skirata away from the game. “You taught us this, remember?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata took the invitation and limped over to join the two squads, who quickly cleared a space in the bar. Ordo, Mereel, and Jusik joined them; Corr stood back, uncertain. Troopers rarely got the chance to see the ritual chant, let alone learn it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I haven't had enough to drink yet,” Skirata said, “but I'll give it a go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Without his armor, he looked even smaller among his commandos than usual. The chant started up.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Taung—sa—rang—bro-ka!</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Je—tii—se-ka—'rta!</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Dha—Wer-da—Ver-da—a'den—tratu!</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">He fell into the rhythm instantly, keeping perfect time, taking rhythmic blows on his leather jacket that normally fell on hard armor. He was a battle-hardened warrior like his lads, just older.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi winked at him, careful to allow for their difference in height.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Cor—u—scan—ta—kan—dosii—adu!</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Duum—mo—tir—ca—'tra—nau—tracinya!</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">Skirata kept up the relentless pace for verse after verse. Fi caught sight of white armor in his peripheral vision and ARC Trooper Captain Maze appeared from the crowd of CSF officers who were watching openmouthed with glasses of ale in their hands.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Mind if I join in?” Maze said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi had no intention of trying to stop an ARC trooper. Maze slipped into the line next to Ordo and smiled at his brother captain in a way Fi didn't quite like.</div>

<div class="paragraph">As Skirata always told outsiders, the <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda</em> took stamina, timing, and total trust in your comrades. Complex rhythms sharpened your brain and taught you to think as one. Turn too fast or too late, and you'd get a nasty smack in the face. It was performed without <em class="calibre6">buy'cese.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wasn't quite as focused as he should have been. Maybe his mind was still on where lovely Besany Wennen might be. Whatever the reason, as Fi turned right, fists clenched, arms at shoulder height, ready to beat the rhythm on Niner's back plate, he saw and heard Maze's fist connect with Ordo's chin.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo carried on, blood weeping from his lip, refusing to break the rhythm. You didn't stop if you got hit. You carried on.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Gra—'tua—cuun—hett—su—dralshya!</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Kom—'rk—tsad—drot-en—t-roch—nyn—ures—adenn!</em></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">The line of commandos turned ninety degrees left, hammering the rhythm, and then right again, and Maze hit Ordo neatly and—Fi had to admit it—elegantly in the mouth again without losing the beat. Blood splashed on Ordo's pristine white chest plate. Fi waited for the encounter to erupt in a fight, but the chant finished without incident and Ordo simply wiped his mouth on the palm of his glove.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry, <em class="calibre6">ner vod,”</em> Maze said, smiling with genuine amusement. “You know how clumsy we <em class="calibre6">ordinary</em> ARC troopers are. We make lousy dancers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi held his breath. He was ready to back Ordo up against Maze; Ordo was his friend. And Fi also knew that he was utterly unpredictable and totally unafraid of violence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo merely shrugged, held out his arm, and the two ARC captains shook hands and went to the bar. Skirata watched them carefully and smiled.</div>

<div class="paragraph">All ARCs were crazy. Sometimes Fi was grateful that he'd had the most volatile bits of Jango removed from his genes.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sat down on a bar stool and wiped sweat from his lined forehead with the palm of his hand.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm not getting any younger,” he said, catching his breath, and laughed. “I'll be black and blue in the morning. Shouldn't try that without body armor.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You could have dipped out after a few minutes,” Fi said. He handed him a cloth. “We wouldn't have minded.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But <em class="calibre6">I</em> would have. I can't ask a man to do what I can't or won't do myself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You never have.” Fi noted that a small silence had formed around the doorway—and its cause was Besany Wennen. She walked in, looking around, then spotted Ordo and went over to him.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm going out on the balcony to get some air,” Skirata said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The last thing Fi saw before Obrim led him away to meet some officers who were very keen to buy him more drinks was Besany Wennen dabbing at Ordo's split lip with a handkerchief and berating a visibly surprised Captain Maze.</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Hello,” Skirata said. “I didn't realize you were out here, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain looked up. She had been peering over the balcony at the lane upon lane of airspeeder traffic below. Nightscapes on Coruscant were as entertaining as a holovid. “It's too noisy for me in there. You look like you've been having fun.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata joined her and rested folded arms on the safety rail. “Been showing CSF the <em class="calibre6">Dha Werda.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“I bet that was painful.” He seemed a fundamentally good man. She adored him, even if he scared her sometimes. “It's good to see everyone relaxing. It's been tough, hasn't it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We did it, though. All of us. You too, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.</em> Well done.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She was blissfully certain of life now. She felt good. She was also certain that Skirata was a man who understood love and the risks people would take to make those they loved happy. He defied generals and anyone who stood in his way to make sure his soldiers—his <em class="calibre6">sons,</em> for that was what they were—got what was rightfully theirs.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no reason not to tell him her wonderful news. She should have told Darman first, but she wasn't quite sure how. And—anyway—Skirata was <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em> He was everyone's father.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thank you for being so understanding about me and Dar,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata rubbed his forehead. “I'm sorry for lecturing you. I'm very protective of them all. But you're both happy, and I'm glad to see that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I hope you'll be glad that I'm having a baby, then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a moment's silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What?” said Skirata.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm pregnant.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She watched his face harden. <em class="calibre6">“Pregnant?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">She hadn't expected that. An unpleasant coldness spread up from her stomach into her chest.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Whose is it?” Skirata asked. His voice was level, controlled, distant. It was a mercenary's voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">That <em class="calibre6">hurt.</em> “Darman's, of course.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He doesn't know, then. He'd have told me if he did.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I haven't told him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How could he cope with that? It's hard enough for a normal—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's not <em class="calibre6">abnormal.</em> He's what you people made him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I meant …” Etain struggled. “I meant that he has no experience to enable him to cope with being a father at a time like this.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Nobody ever has.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I wanted him to have some kind of future.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata's face didn't change. “You <em class="calibre6">planned</em> this? How can he have a future if he <em class="calibre6">doesn't know he has a son?</em> Genes don't count for everything.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If anyone finds out that I'm expecting a child, I'll be thrown out of the Jedi Order and I won't be able to serve. I have to carry on. I <em class="calibre6">can't</em> let the men down.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was furious. She felt it. She could see it, too. And if she thought that was bad, it would be nothing compared with how the Jedi Council would react. She'd be kicked out of the Order. She'd no longer be a general, no longer able to play her part in the war.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">But you knew that.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">You should have thought that through.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The reality felt very different. And yet she didn't regret it one bit, and that was why she hadn't thought about the Jedi Council's reaction. It was <em class="calibre6">right.</em> The Force had guided her to this point.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And how are you planning to disguise this fact?” Skirata asked, still cold calm. “It's going to be pretty visible.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can go into a healing trance and accelerate the pregnancy. I can bear this child in five months.” She put her hand on her belly. “It's a boy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">That was probably the worst thing she could have told Skirata. Etain should have known Mandalorians better by now. The father–son bond was paramount. Every scrap of warmth that he had ever shown her had evaporated: and it devastated her. She had grown to love him as a father, too.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And a good <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> father put his son first.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“In this great plan of yours, then, this plan to give my lad a future, what did you think his son might become? A <em class="calibre6">Jedi?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. Just a man. A man with a normal life.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.”</em> Skirata's hands were thrust in his pockets now. She could see the rise and fall of his chest as his breathing labored with suppressed rage. A little black vortex in the Force opened up around him. “No, Darman's son <em class="calibre6">will</em> be Mandalorian, or he has no son at all. Don't you understand? Unless the kid has his culture and what makes him Mandalorian, he … he has no soul. That's why I had to teach them all, <em class="calibre6">all</em> my boys, what it was to be <em class="calibre6">Mando.</em> Without it they're dead men.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I know how important it is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I don't think you do. We're nomadic. We have no country. All we have to hold us together is what we are, what we do, and without that we're … <em class="calibre6">dar'manda.</em> I don't know how to explain it … we have no soul, no afterlife, no identity. We're eternally dead.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain repeated <em class="calibre6">dar'manda</em> to herself. “That's how he got his name, isn't it?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It began to dawn on her why Skirata and Vau were both so obsessed with teaching their trainees about their heritage. They weren't just giving them a cultural identity: they were literally saving their lives, their very souls. “He'll be a Force-user. That will make him—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Are you <em class="calibre6">insane?</em> Do you know what that makes him worth to creatures like the Kaminoans? Do you know how <em class="calibre6">very</em> interested people will be in his genetic material? He's in <em class="calibre6">danger,</em> you <em class="calibre6">di'kut!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">The value of her son's unique genetic heritage had never crossed Etain's mind. She was appalled. She struggled to cope with the hazards that sprang up around her as if from nowhere. “But how can Dar raise him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You didn't ask that question when you started all this? Do you really love him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Yes!</em> Yes, you <em class="calibre6">know</em> I do. Kal, if I don't have his child and he dies—”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“When</em> he dies. He's designed to <em class="calibre6">die young.</em> I'll outlive him. And you're built to live a <em class="calibre6">long</em> time.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You said it yourself—just one broad generation of men. Then there's <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> of the clones left eventually, nothing to show they ever lived and served and <em class="calibre6">died.</em> They <em class="calibre6">all</em> deserve better than that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But again, Darman <em class="calibre6">isn't given any choice,”</em> Kal said. “No choice about fighting. No choice about being a father.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He lapsed into silence, walking to the far side of the balcony and leaning on it, just as he had when she'd seen him agonize over whether he had been a monster, a man who turned small boys into soldiers and sent them to fight the <em class="calibre6">aritedise's</em> war.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain waited. There was no point arguing with him. He was right: she took choice out of Darman's hands just as every Jedi general did.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal,” she said.</div>

<div class="paragraph">He didn't turn.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She put a cautious hand on his back. She felt him tense. “Kal, what do you want me to do to make this right? Don't you want at least one of your men to leave something behind him, someone who'll remember him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You can only remember what you know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'll keep the child safe—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You've got a name for him, haven't you? I <em class="calibre6">know</em> it. You know you're expecting a boy so you'll have thought of a name. Mothers do that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes. I—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Then I don't want to hear it. If you want my help, I have conditions.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">She knew that. She should have known. Skirata took his paternal role obsessively, and he was a hard man, a mercenary, a man whose whole instinct had been honed to fight and survive since he was a small boy.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I need your help, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't call me that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You want my help? Then here are my terms. Darman is told he has a son when it's safe for <em class="calibre6">him</em> to know, not when it suits you. And if that isn't when the kid's born, then I name the boy as a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad.</em> Fathers name their sons, so if Dar can do that, then I'll make sure that he does.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So I don't have any choice.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You could skip town to any one of a thousand planets if you wanted to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you'd find me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Oh yes. <em class="calibre6">I find</em> people. It's my job.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“And you'd tell the Jedi Order. You hate me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, I actually like you, <em class="calibre6">ad'ika.</em> I just despise Jedi. You Force-users never question your right to shape the galaxy. And ordinary people never realize they have the chance to.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I think … I think it would be very fitting for Darman's son to know his heritage.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He'll do more than that. If Darman can't raise him as a <em class="calibre6">Mando,</em> then I will. I've had plenty of practice. <em class="calibre6">Plenty.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain was helpless. Her only choice was to run—and she knew that wasn't fair to anyone, least of all to the baby. It would have confirmed to her that all she wanted was a child, something to cling to and love and be loved by in return, regardless of how she got it.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">This had to be for Darman.</em> His son could <em class="calibre6">not</em> grow up an ordinary man. And Etain had no idea how to raise a <em class="calibre6">Mando</em> son. Skirata did. If she refused, she knew exactly how far he would go to get his way.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“How will you cope with a Force-using child?” she asked.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“The same way I raised six lads who were so disturbed and damaged by being placed in live-fire battle simulations as toddlers that they never stood a chance of being normal. With a lot of love and patience.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You actually <em class="calibre6">want</em> to do this, don't you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, I do. More than anything. It's my absolute duty as a <em class="calibre6">Mando'ad”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">So that was his price. “I can disguise the pregnancy—”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, you're going to have a nice quiet few months under deep cover on Qiilura, with one of Jinart's people to keep an eye on you. And just watch me make that happen. Then you return with the child, and I raise it here. A grandson. Given my family history, nobody will turn a hair.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What will you call him?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If Darman is in a position to know when the child's born, it'll be <em class="calibre6">his</em> choice. Until then, I'll keep my ideas to myself.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you agree Darman shouldn't know yet.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If I tell him, or you do, then how is he going to go off to war again and keep his mind on his own safety? He ships out again in a few days. So will you. This isn't like telling a regular lad that he's made a girl pregnant, and that can be bad enough. He's a clone with no rights and no real idea of the real world, and he's made his Jedi general pregnant. Do I have to draw you a picture?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain had never truly enraged anyone. The Jedi who had raised her and trained her all her life had been far beyond that emotion. They allowed themselves a little impatience or irritation, but never anger. And on Qiilura, when she had the responsibility for four commandos thrust upon her for the first time in a desperate, dangerous mission, Jinart's anger at her inexperience had been well short of rage.</div>

<div class="paragraph">But Skirata was now drowning in it. She could feel his blind anger and how he was holding it in check. She could see the ashen tone of his face, drained of blood. She could hear the strain in his voice.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Kal, you of all people should know how much it matters. Your own sons disowned you for putting your clone soldiers before them. You <em class="calibre6">must</em> know what it feels like to risk hatred and contempt to do the right thing for those you love. And why you'd do the same again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“If you had been Laseema telling me she was carrying Atin's child, things would have been very different,” he hissed.</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was a movement behind them.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">“Kal'buir?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Etain turned. Ordo stood in the doorway. She hadn't felt him approaching; compared with the disturbance Kal was generating in the Force, he was invisible.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's okay, son.” Skirata looked embarrassed and beckoned him across. He managed to feign a smile. “So Captain Maze got his own back, then?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo, attuned to Skirata's reactions, looked at Etain suspiciously. He felt like the strut in the Force right then, except there was no joyful sense of a wild infant at play, just ferocity. “Honor has been satisfied, as they say. I wondered if you wanted to join us for a drink. Besany is anxious to see you again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ah, <em class="calibre6">us</em> sounds as if you two are getting on very well.” Skirata smiled, and it was real: Besany Wennen was not, of course, a <em class="calibre6">jetii, a</em> Jedi. She was acceptable. “I'd love to, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.</em> Etain and I were just finishing our chat anyway.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata left as if nothing had happened. Etain leaned on the rail, forehead on her crossed arms, and felt almost completely crushed. But Skirata was right in everything he had said: and he would honor his promise to help her. The price was inevitable. She would pay it.</div>

<div class="paragraph">She focused on the joy that surrounded her son in the Force. However hard things became, that was one thing nobody could take from her—not even <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.</em></div>

<h1 id="calibre_toc_28" class="calibre7"><a id="TOC_id36430322" class="calibre8"></a><a name="TOC_id36430323" class="calibre8"></a>25 <br class="calibre9"/>

</h1><div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Of course I've planned a way out. I've been a mercenary since I was seven years old. You always plan for what happens when the current war is over. It's called an exit strategy, and mine's been in the planning a long, long time.</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">–Kal Skirata to Jailer Obrim, discussing the future in an uncertain galaxy</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Coruscant Security Force Staff and Social Club, 0015 hours, </strong><strong class="calibre11">389 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">“Well, that was fun,” Jailer Obrim said, heaving himself onto a bar stool. The club was almost deserted now. “They don't drink much, your boys, do they?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“They make up for it with eating.” Skirata was working out how he would deal with the current crisis. Jinart the Gurlanin had disappeared in that way that only shapeshifting Gurlanins could. She didn't have a comlink, and he wouldn't run into her eating a fried breakfast at the Kragget. He had to find another way of summoning her. “Enormous appetites. It's the accelerated aging that boosts their metabolisms.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Obrim scratched his cheek, looking embarrassed. “I know, friend. I've not been through what you've been through with them, but anyone in our game will understand just how you feel.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah.” <em class="calibre6">But Darman has a son now. I'm angry that Etain let that happen without even asking him, but he has a son. Even if I never get hold of that Kaminoan aiwha-bait Ko Sai, he</em> does <em class="calibre6">have some kind of future now.</em> “I'm sorry if I take it out on you sometimes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Don't you ever worry about that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“What would you do if you could run the galaxy now, Kal? I mean anything.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata didn't even pause to think. “I'd stop the war right now,” he said. “Then I'd go back to Kamino and grab those gray freaks by their rotten skinny necks and make them engineer a normal life span for every single last one of our boys. Then I'd take the whole army home to Mandalore and spend the rest of my life making sure they had wives and families, and a purpose that was <em class="calibre6">theirs,</em> not some <em class="calibre6">aruetii's</em> private feud.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I thought you might say that,” Obrim said. “I ought to be getting home now. Last few days have been a bit rough on my wife. Y'know, never at home. Why don't you come around for dinner sometime?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'd like that.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Can I drop you off?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm waiting for Ordo. He's talking to Besany.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I noticed.” Obrim just smiled. “He's a smart boy.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata was left contemplating a future that had seemed no more tangled than it ever had just a few hours ago, but was now totally upended. He stood up and threw his knife into the carvings around the bar a few times and thought about his bank account on Aargau, and the fact that Mereel was very close to finding Ko Sai. Skirata felt he was now in striking distance of making a better life for a handful of cloned soldiers—a tiny number out of so many, but that was all he could do. That had to be enough.</div>

<div class="paragraph">And he had an even sharper focus now. Darman had a son, and he would see that Darman was around to watch the boy grow up.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Sorry I kept you, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.”</em> Ordo strode into the bar and attempted a smile, but winced at his split lip. “We can go now.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Everything working out with Besany?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Just yes?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ummm … I think it is.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good.” He resisted the urge to interfere. “I have a question for you. I need to get hold of Jinart. How would I do that?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Easy. She's a spy. She monitors the GAR troop movements to and from Qiilura. I can put a message in the logistics system that will get her attention. Something subtle. Give me a time and place, and leave the rest to me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had to smile. Almost everything was easy for Ordo. “Back to the barracks then.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I have a question for you, too, <em class="calibre6">Kal'buir.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Is it true what Etain said? Did your sons disown you because you stayed on Kamino with us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo wasn't stupid and he wasn't deaf. Skirata's family shame was the one thing he never wanted any of them to know about, and not only because it might make them feel guilty. He didn't want them to fear he might abandon <em class="calibre6">them</em> with equal ease.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“It's true, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Why would you even think of paying such a terrible price for <em class="calibre6">us?”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“Because you <em class="calibre6">needed me.</em> And I never regretted it for a second. My relationship with my … former family was as good as dead before you were even thought of. Don't you ever give it a second thought, because I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No question.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But I wish we had known.”</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Do I have the right to keep another secret, then?</em> “I'm sorry.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So apart from Darman's unborn son, is there anything else you keep from us?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">He'd heard him arguing with Etain, then. Skirata felt the most agonizing shame he had ever experienced in his life. His whole existence now rested on the absolute trust between him and his clone family. He couldn't bear to lose that.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“So you know what I'm going to ask of Jinart, then. I heard the news when you did, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.</em> And no, there is nothing else. I swore I would never lie to you, and I never have.” Skirata pointed to Ordo's matched blasters. “If I ever do, I'd rather you used those on me. Because being there for you was the only decent thing I ever did in my life. Understand?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo just stared at him. Skirata put both hands up on his shoulders and stood there in silence.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, son, tell me what I should do about Darman, and I'll do it.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Ordo still had that look of blank appraisal, the expression he adopted when dismantling a new and fascinating puzzle. “I don't think the time is right. We have to do what's best for our brothers.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was the pragmatic thing to do. Skirata fastened his jacket and checked that his knife was in place, his ritual for leaving any building and walking out into the unknown night.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Agreed, <em class="calibre6">Ord'ika.</em> Now all I need to do is have a little chat with General Zey.”</div>

<br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre11">Arca Company Barracks, Special Forces</strong><strong class="calibre11">HQ, Coruscant, </strong><strong class="calibre11">395 days after Geonosis</strong></div>

<br class="calibre1"/><div class="paragraph">It was an op order—an operational order—like many others they had been given. Niner glanced at the datapad and shrugged.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Well, that'll be interesting,” he said. “Never worked with the Galactic Marines before.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata sat on the table in the briefing room, swinging his legs. Delta Squad had left that morning to prepare the battlefield—a nice military understatement for going ahead of the main assault and sabotaging strategic targets—on Skuumaa. Omega had drawn the slightly longer straw and had a similar task to carry out for the Marines.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Everyone okay?” The question was directed at Darman as much as anybody. “Any questions?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, Sarge.” Fi sounded a little subdued. Atin actually seemed more cheerful than Fi did, which was an interesting reversal of attitudes. “It'll be nice to see Commander Gett again.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Gett wants you embarked in <em class="calibre6">Fearless</em> by oh-seven hundred tomorrow. So if there's anything you want to do, do it today.” Skirata reached in his jacket pocket, took out four high denomination credit chips, and passed them around. “Go on. You know your way around the interesting bits of Coruscant now. It'll be a few months before you're back here.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Thanks, Sarge.” Atin stood up to leave. “You'll still be here when we get back today?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I always see you off, don't I?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yeah, Sarge. You do.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Fi took his chip and pressed it back into Skirata's hand. “Thanks. I've got to do some calibration on my HUD. I'll stick around the barracks today.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“He's gone all sober,” Niner said. “Don't know what's come over him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I'm an unsung hero,” said Fi. “I've got my public image to protect.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Omega boys, like all squads, were well attuned to one anther's sensitivities. They knew Skirata was hanging around to talk to Darman on his own. Niner shoved Atin and Fi toward the doors. “See you later, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">There was no question of Darman joining them for a last day out in town. They knew where he'd want to spend his time. Skirata waited for the briefing room doors to close and slid off the table to stand in front of Darman's seat.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Now, son, anything troubling you?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“No, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Etain's off to Qiilura for a few months, to start the rundown of the garrison.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman actually smiled. “That's a safe deployment compared with the jobs she's pulled recently. I'm glad.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“She's hanging around the barracks waiting for you.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman seemed relieved. He took a deep breath and grinned, but it was that smile Skirata had seen on many mercenaries' faces before they left for a new battlefield.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em class="calibre6">Fierfek, should I tell this boy now? Should I tell him he has a kid on the way? What if something happens to him before he gets a chance to find out?</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata took a sudden and impulsive risk. He could square it with Zey later, like the bill for the anti-terror operation. <em class="calibre6">Always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.</em> “You can go to Qiilura with her if you want.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman shut his eyes. The pain showed on his face.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I've had that choice before, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“You love her, though?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I can make this happen.” <em class="calibre6">Maybe it wouldn't be right for you, son. But it's your choice.</em> “All you have to do is say the word, and Corr will take your place in the squad. He's still around. Zey's letting me train him.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman let out a long breath and pinched the bridge of his nose, eyes still shut. When he opened them, they were brimming with tears.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Qiilura's <em class="calibre6">safe.</em> My squad deploys in the front line. How can I <em class="calibre6">not</em> be there with them? You could have walked away from Kamino with a fortune and never given us another thought, but you couldn't do it, either.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“That was different. I was washed up, a <em class="calibre6">di'kutla—”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“No. You were <em class="calibre6">loyal.”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">“You sure about this?” <em class="calibre6">Of course you're sure. Your loyalty is overwhelming, too. That's how the stinking Republic uses you.</em> “I won't think any less of you if you go.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“But <em class="calibre6">I'll</em> think less of me.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Okay, no need to tell her, then. It was my idea, not hers. And Ordo will make sure you two can stay in touch whenever you want.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman brushed the tip of his nose and sniffed hard. “You always put us first.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“I always will.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“We know.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Yes. He always would. “There's two ways you can think of females in wartime, son. One is to get obsessed and let them take your mind off your work, and that gets you killed. The other is to focus on them as what you're really fighting for, and draw strength from knowing they're going to be there for you when you get home.” He tapped Darman's cheek a few times with the flat of his hand, firm but paternal. “You know which you're going to choose, don't you, Dar?”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sarge.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Good lad.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata knew that Darman might never arrive home, throw his kit bag on the hall floor, and sob on his wife's shoulder, relieved and grateful and swearing it would be his last tour of duty. But he'd make sure he brought him as close to that sweet normality as a cloned soldier could ever come.</div>

<div class="paragraph">At least Etain understood what a soldier went through. All Skirata had to do was make sure the kid was safe when he was born, and educate him properly. Jinart had held up her end of the bargain and would see that Etain was taken care of on Qiilura. The shapeshifter understood Skirata's obsession with looking after his tribe. She was doing the same thing herself. They were both beleaguered fighters with no love for the Republic, just an uneasy tolerance.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Go on, then, son.” Skirata nodded toward the doors. “Go and find Etain. Have a day out. Be a regular couple for a few hours and forget you're soldiers. Just be discreet, that's all.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Darman smiled and seemed to brighten. He was a resilient lad. “Sarge,” he said. “How can I forget I'm a soldier? I don't know how to be anything else.”</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata watched him go and wondered when the desire to tell him would overwhelm him and it would slip out. Maybe Etain would find the strain too great, too. It was a pity that something that was a source of joy to ordinary people was so dangerous for Darman and Etain.</div>

<div class="paragraph">It was a rotten war. <em class="calibre6">You should have grown used to all that by now, you fool.</em> But he doubted he ever would.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Skirata had plenty to occupy him while Omega was away—two datapads' worth and then some. He took a deep breath and opened his comlink.</div>

<div class="paragraph">“Ordo? Mereel? Let's go hunt some Kaminoan aiwha bait. We have plans to make. <em class="calibre6">Oya!”</em></div>

<div class="paragraph">He was a skilled bounty hunter: they were the best intelligence troops in the galaxy.</div>

        THIEF OF TIME <br class="calibre7"/>
      </h1>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">According to the First Scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised</em>, Wen stepped out of the cave where he had received enlightenment and into the dawning light of the first day of the rest of his life. He stared at the rising sun for some time, because he had never seen it before.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He prodded with a sandal the dozing form of Clodpool the Apprentice, and said: “I have seen. Now I understand.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then he stopped, and looked at the thing next to Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is that amazing thing?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… er… it's a tree, master,” said Clodpool, still not quite awake. “Remember? It was there yesterday.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There was no yesterday.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… er… I think there <em class="calibre9">was</em>, master,” said Clodpool, struggling to his feet. “Remember? We came up here and I cooked a meal, and had the rind off your <em class="calibre9">sklang </em>because you didn't want it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">remember </em>yesterday,” said Wen thoughtfully. “But the memory is in my head <em class="calibre9">now</em>. Was yesterday real? Or is it only the memory that is real? Truly, yesterday I was not born.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool's face became a mask of agonized incomprehension.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Dear stupid Clodpool, I have learned everything,” said Wen. “In the cup of the hand there is no past, no future. There is only now. There is no time but the present. We have a great deal to do.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool hesitated. There was something new about his master. There was a glow in his eyes and, when he moved, there were strange silvery-blue lights in the air, like reflections from liquid mirrors.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“She has told me everything,” Wen went on. “I know that time was made for men, not the other way round. I have learned how to shape it and bend it. I know how to make a moment last for ever, because it already has. And I can teach these skills even to you, Clodpool. I have heard the heartbeat of the universe. I know the answers to many questions. Ask me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The apprentice gave him a bleary look. It was too early in the morning for it to be early in the morning. That was the only thing that he currently knew for sure.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… what does master want for breakfast?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen looked down from their camp and across the snowfields and purple mountains to the golden daylight creating the world, and mused upon certain aspects of humanity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah,” he said. “One of the <em class="calibre9">difficult </em>ones.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">For something to exist, it has to be observed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For something to exist, it has to have a position in time and space. And this explains why nine-tenths of the mass of the universe is unaccounted for.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nine-tenths of the universe is the knowledge of the position and direction of everything in the other tenth. Every atom has its biography, every star its file, every chemical exchange its equivalent of the inspector with a clipboard. It is unaccounted for because it is doing the accounting for the rest of it, and you cannot see the back of your own head.<a href="#TOT_APF1" title="1. Except in very small universes"><sup class="calibre10">1</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nine-tenths of the universe, in fact, is the paperwork.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And if you want the story, then remember that a story does not unwind. It weaves. Events that start in different places and different times all bear down on that one tiny point in space-time, which is the perfect moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Supposing an emperor was persuaded to wear a new suit of clothes whose material was so fine that, to the common eye, the clothes weren't there. And suppose a little boy pointed out this fact in a loud, clear voice…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then you have The Story of the Emperor Who Had No Clothes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But if you knew a bit more, it would be The Story Of The Boy Who Got A Well-Deserved Thrashing From His Dad For Being Rude To Royalty, And Was Locked Up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Or The Story Of The Whole Crowd Who Were Rounded Up By The Guards And Told “This Didn't Happen, Okay? Does Anyone Want To Argue?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Or it could be a story of how a whole kingdom suddenly saw the benefits of the “new clothes”, and developed an enthusiasm for healthy sports<a href="#TOT_APF2" title="2. Mostly involving big, big beachballs."><sup class="calibre10">2</sup></a> in a lively and refreshing atmosphere which got many new adherents every year, and led to a recession caused by the collapse of the conventional clothing industry.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It could even be a story about The Great Pneumonia Epidemic of '09.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It all depends on how much you know.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Suppose you'd watched the slow accretion of snow over thousands of years as it was compressed and pushed over the deep rock until the glacier calved its icebergs into the sea, and you watched an iceberg drift out through the chilly waters, and you got to know its cargo of happy polar bears and seals as they looked forward to a brave new life in the other hemisphere where they say the ice floes are lined with crunchy penguins, and then <em class="calibre9">wham</em>! Tragedy loomed in the shape of thousands of tons of unaccountably floating iron and an exciting sound track…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…you'd want to know the <em class="calibre9">whole </em>story.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And this one starts with desks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This is the desk of a professional. It is clear that their job is their life. There are… human touches, but these are the human touches that strict usage allows in a chilly world of duty and routine.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mostly they're on the only piece of real colour in this picture of blacks and greys. It's a coffee mug. Someone somewhere wanted to make it a <em class="calibre9">jolly </em>mug. It bears a rather unconvincing picture of a teddy bear, and the legend “To The World's Greatest Grandad” and the slight change in the style of lettering on the word “Grandad” makes it clear that this has come from one of those stalls that have <em class="calibre9">hundreds </em>of mugs like this, declaring that they're for the world's greatest Grandad/Dad/Mum/Granny/Uncle/Aunt/Blank. Only someone whose life contains very little else, one feels, would treasure a piece of gimcrackery like this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It currently holds tea, with a slice of lemon.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The bleak desktop also contains a paperknife in the shape of a scythe and a number of hourglasses.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death picks up the mug in a skeletal hand…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…and took a sip, pausing only to look again at the wording he'd read thousands of times before, and then put it down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">VERY WELL, he said, in tones of funeral bells. SHOW ME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The last item on the desktop was a mechanical contrivance. “Contrivance” was exactly the right kind of word for it. Most of it was two discs. One was horizontal and contained a circlet of very small squares of what would prove to be carpet. The other was set vertically and had a large number of arms, each one of which held a very small slice of buttered toast. Each slice was set so that it could spin freely as the turning of the wheel brought it down towards the carpet disc.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I BELIEVE I AM BEGINNING TO GET THE IDEA, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The small figure by the machine saluted smartly and beamed, if a rat skull could beam. It pulled a pair of goggles over its eye sockets, hitched up its robe and clambered into the machine.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death was never quite sure why he allowed the Death of Rats to have an independent existence. After all, being Death meant being the Death of <em class="calibre9">everything</em>, including rodents of all descriptions. But perhaps everyone needs a tiny part of themselves that can, metaphorically, be allowed to run naked in the rain,<a href="#TOT_APF3" title="3. Quite an overrated activity."><sup class="calibre10">3</sup></a> to think the unthinkable thoughts, to hide in corners and spy on the world, to do the forbidden but enjoyable deeds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Slowly, the Death of Rats pushed the treadles. The wheels began to spin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exciting, eh?” said a hoarse voice by Death's ear. It belonged to Quoth, the raven, who had attached himself to the household as the Death of Rats' personal transport and crony. He was, he always said, only in it for the eyeballs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The carpets began to turn. The tiny toasties slapped down randomly, sometimes with a buttery squelch, sometimes without. Quoth watched carefully, in case any eyeballs were involved.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death saw that some time and effort had been spent devising a mechanism to rebutter each returning slice. An even more complex one measured the number of buttered carpets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After a couple of complete turns the lever of the buttered carpet ratio device had moved to 60 percent, and the wheels stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WELL? said Death. THIS PROVES NOTHING. IF YOU DID IT AGAIN, IT COULD WELL BE THAT—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats shifted a gear lever and began to pedal again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK, it commanded. Death obediently leaned closer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This time the needle went only as high as 40 percent.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death leaned closer still.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The eight pieces of carpet that had been buttered this time were, in their entirety, the pieces that had been missed first time round.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Spidery cogwheels whirred in the machine. A sign emerged, rather shakily, on springs, with an effect that was the visual equivalent of the word “boing”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A moment later two sparklers spluttered fitfully into life and sizzled away on either side of the word MALIGNITY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death nodded. It was just as he'd suspected.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He crossed his study, the Death of Rats scampering ahead of him, and reached a full-length mirror. It was dark, like the bottom of a well. There was a pattern of skulls and bones around the frame, for the sake of appearances; Death could not look himself in the skull in a mirror with cherubs and roses around it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats climbed the frame in a scrabble of claws and looked at Death expectantly from the top. Quoth fluttered over, and pecked briefly at his own reflection, on the basis that anything was worth a try.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SHOW ME, said Death. SHOW ME… MY THOUGHTS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A chessboard appeared, but it was triangular, and so big that only the nearest point could be seen. Right on this point was the world—turtle, elephants, the little orbiting sun and all. It was the Discworld, which existed only just this side of total improbability and, therefore, in border country. In border country the border gets crossed, and sometimes things creep into the universe that have rather more on their mind than a better life for their children and a wonderful future in the fruit-picking and domestic service industries.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On every other black or white triangle of the chessboard, all the way to infinity, was a small grey shape, rather like an empty hooded robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Why now? thought Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He recognized them. They were not life forms. They were… nonlife-forms. They were the observers of the operation of the universe, its clerks, its <em class="calibre9">auditors</em>. They saw to it that things spun and rocks fell.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And they believed that for a thing to exist it had to have a position in time and space. Humanity had arrived as a nasty shock. Humanity practically <em class="calibre9">was </em>things that didn't have a position in time and space, such as imagination, pity, hope, history and belief. Take those away and all you had was an ape that fell out of trees a lot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Intelligent life was, therefore, an anomaly. It made the filing untidy. The Auditors <em class="calibre9">hated </em>things like that. Periodically, they tried to tidy things up a little.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The year before, astronomers across the Discworld had been puzzled to see the stars wheel gently across the sky as the world-turtle executed a roll. The thickness of the world never allowed them to see why, but Great A'Tuin's ancient head had snaked out and down and had snapped right out of the sky the speeding asteroid that would, had it hit, have meant that no one would have needed to buy a diary ever again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No, the world could take care of obvious threats like that. So now the grey robes preferred more subtle, cowardly skirmishes in their endless desire for a universe where nothing happened that was not completely predictable.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The butter-side-down effect was only a trivial but telling indicator. It showed an increase in activity. Give up, was their eternal message. Go back to being blobs in the ocean. Blobs are easy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the great game went on at many levels, Death knew. And often it was hard to know who was playing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERY CAUSE HAS ITS EFFECT, he said aloud. SO EVERY EFFECT HAS ITS CAUSE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He nodded at the Death of Rats. SHOW ME, said Death. SHOW ME… A BEGINNING.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a bitter winter's night. The man hammered on the back door, sending snow sliding off the roof.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The girl, who had been admiring her new hat in the mirror, tweaked the already low neckline of her dress for slightly more exposure, just in case the caller was male, and went and opened the door.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A figure was outlined against the freezing starlight. Flakes were already building up on his cloak.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Ogg? The midwife?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's Miss, actually,” she said proudly. “And witch, too, o'course.” She indicated her new black pointy hat. She was still at the stage of wearing it in the house.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You must come at once. It's very urgent.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The girl looked suddenly panic-stricken. “Is it Mrs Weaver? I didn't reckon she was due for another couple of we—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have come a long way,” said the figure. “They say you are the best in the world.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? Me? I've only delivered one!” said Miss Ogg, now looking hunted. “Biddy Spective is a lot more experienced than me! And old Minnie Forthwright! Mrs Weaver was going to be my first solo, 'cos she's built like a wardro—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I do beg your pardon. I will not trespass further on your time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The stranger retreated into the flake-speckled shadows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hello?” said Miss Ogg. “Hello?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But there was nothing there, except footprints. Which stopped in the middle of the snow-covered path…</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a hammering on the door. Mrs Ogg put down the child that had been sitting on her knee and went and raised the latch.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A dark figure stood outlined against the warm summer evening sky, and there was something strange about its shoulders.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Ogg? You are married now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yep. Twice,” said Mrs Ogg cheerfully. “What can I do for y—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You must come at once. Its very urgent.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't know anyone was—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have come a long way,” said the figure.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs Ogg paused. There was something in the way he had pronounced <em class="calibre9">long</em>. And now she could see that the whiteness on the cloak was snow, melting fast. Faint memory stirred.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, now,” she said, because she'd learned a lot in the last twenty years or so, “that's as may be, and I'll always do the best I can, ask anyone. But I wouldn't say I'm <em class="calibre9">the </em>best. Always learnin' something new, that's me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. In that case I will call at a more convenient… moment.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why've you got snow on—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But, without ever quite vanishing, the stranger was no longer present…</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a hammering on the door. Nanny Ogg carefully put down her brandy nightcap and stared at the wall for a moment. Now a lifetime of edge witchery<a href="#TOT_APF4" title="4. An edge witch is one who makes her living on the edges, in that moment when boundary conditions apply—between life and death, light and dark, good and evil and, most dangerously of all, today and tomorrow."><sup class="calibre10">4</sup></a> had honed senses that most people never really knew they had, and something in her head went “click”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the hob the kettle for her hot-water bottle was just coming to the boil.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She laid down her pipe, got up and opened the door on this springtime midnight.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've come a long way, I'm thinking,” she said, showing no surprise at the dark figure.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is true, Mrs Ogg.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Everyone who knows me calls me Nanny.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She looked down at the melting snow dripping off the cloak. It hadn't snowed up here for a month.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And it's urgent, I expect?” she said, as memory unrolled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now you got to say, ‘You must come at once.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre9">must </em>come at once.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, now,” she said. “I'd say, <em class="calibre9">yes,</em> I'm a pretty good midwife, though I do say it myself. I've seen hundreds into the world. Even trolls, which is no errand for the inexperienced. I know birthing backwards and forwards and damn near sideways at times. Always been ready to learn something new, though.” She looked down modestly. “I wouldn't say I'm the best,” she said, “but I can't think of anyone better, I have to say.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You must leave with me now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I must, must I?” said Nanny Ogg.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An edge witch thinks fast, because edges can shift so quickly. And she learns to tell when a mythology is unfolding, and when the best you can do is put yourself in its path and run to keep up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll just go and get—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There is <em class="calibre9">no time</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I can't just walk right out and—” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Now</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny reached behind the door for her birthing bag, always kept there for just such occasions as this, full of the things she knew she'd want and a few of the things she always prayed she'd never need.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She left.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The kettle was just boiling when Nanny walked back into her kitchen. She stared at it for a moment and then moved it off the fire.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was still a drop of brandy left in the glass by her chair. She drained that, then refilled the glass to the brim from the bottle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She picked up her pipe. The bowl was still warm. She pulled on it, and the coals crackled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she took something out of her bag, which was now a good deal emptier, and, brandy glass in her hand, sat down to look at it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well,” she said at last. “That was… very unusual…”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Death watched the image fade. A few flakes of snow that had blown out of the mirror had already melted on the floor, but there was still a whiff of pipe smoke in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH, I SEE, he said. A BIRTHING, IN STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT IS THAT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS OR WAS THAT WHAT THE SOLUTION WILL BE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK, said the Death of Rats.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">QUITE SO, said Death. YOU MAY VERY WELL BE RIGHT. I DO KNOW THAT THE MIDWIFE WILL NEVER TELL ME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats looked surprised. SQUEAK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death smiled. DEATH? ASKING AFTER THE LIFE OF A CHILD? NO. SHE WOULD NOT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“'scuse me,” said the raven, “but how come Miss Ogg became Mrs Ogg? Sounds like a bit of a rural arrangement, if you catch my meaning.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WITCHES ARE MATRILINEAL, said Death. THEY FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE MEN THAN TO CHANGE NAMES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He went back to his desk and opened a drawer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a thick book there, bound in night. On the cover, where a book like this might otherwise say “Our Wedding” or “Acme Photo Album”, it said “MEMORIES”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death turned the heavy pages carefully. Some of the memories escaped as he did so, forming brief pictures in the air before the page turned, and they went flying and fading into the distant, dark corners of the room. There were snatches of sound, too, of laughter, tears, screams and for some reason a brief burst of xylophone music, which caused him to pause for a moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An immortal has a great deal to remember. Sometimes its better to put things where they will be safe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One ancient memory, brown and cracking round the edges, lingered in the air over the desk. It showed five figures, four on horseback, one in a chariot, all apparently riding out of a thunderstorm. The horses were at a flat gallop. There was a lot of smoke and flame and general excitement.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH, THE OLD DAYS, said Death. BEFORE THERE WAS THIS FASHION FOR HAVING A SOLO CAREER.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK? the Death of Rats enquired.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">OH, YES, said Death. ONCE THERE WERE FIVE OF US. <em class="calibre9">FIVE </em>HORSEMEN. BUT YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE. THERE'S ALWAYS A ROW. CREATIVE DISAGREEMENTS, ROOMS BEING TRASHED, THAT SORT OF THING. He sighed. AND THINGS SAID THAT PERHAPS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAID.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He turned a few more pages and sighed again. When you needed an ally, and you were Death, on whom could you absolutely rely?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">His thoughtful gaze fell on the teddy bear mug.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Of course, there was always family. Yes. He'd promised not to do this again, but he'd never got the hang of promises.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He got up and went back to the mirror. There was not a lot of time. Things in the mirror were closer than they appeared.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a slithering noise, a breathless moment of silence, and a crash like a bag of skittles being dropped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats winced. The raven took off hurriedly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">HELP ME UP, PLEASE, said a voice from the shadows. AND THEN PLEASE CLEAN UP THE DAMN BUTTER.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">This </em>desk was a field of galaxies.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Things twinkled. There were complex wheels and spirals, brilliant against the blackness…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy always liked the moment when he had a clock in pieces, with every wheel and spring carefully laid out on the black velvet cloth in front of him. It was like looking at Time, dismantled, controllable, every part of it understood…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He wished his life was like that. It would be nice to reduce it to bits, spread them all out on the table, clean and oil them properly and put them together so that they coiled and spun as they ought to. But sometimes it seemed that the life of Jeremy had been assembled by a not very competent craftsman, who had allowed a number of small but important things to go <em class="calibre9">ping </em>into the corners of the room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He wished he liked people more, but somehow he could never get on with them. He never knew what to say. If life was a party, he wasn't even in the kitchen. He envied the people who made it as far as the kitchen. There would probably be the remains of the dip to eat, and a bottle or two of cheap wine that someone had brought along that'd probably be okay if you took out the drowned cigarette stubs. There might even be a girl in the kitchen, although Jeremy knew the limits of his imagination.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But Jeremy never even got an invitation.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clocks, now… clocks were different. He knew what made clocks tick.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">His full name was Jeremy Clockson, and that was no accident. He'd been a member of the Guild of Clockmakers since he was a few days old, and everyone knew what <em class="calibre9">that </em>meant. It meant his life had begun in a basket, on a doorstep. Everyone knew how it worked. All the Guilds took in the foundlings that arrived with the morning milk. It was an ancient form of charity, and there were far worse fates. The orphans got a life, and an upbringing of a sort, and a trade, and a future, and a name. Many a fine lady or master craftsman or city dignitary had a telltale surname like Ludd or Doughy or Pune or Clockson. They'd been named after trade heroes or patron deities, and this turned them into a family, of a sort. The older ones remembered where they came from, and at Hogswatch they were free with donations of food and clothing to the various younger brothers and sisters of the basket. It wasn't perfect, but, then, what is?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So Jeremy had grown up healthy, and rather strange, and with a gift for his adoptive craft that almost made up for every other personal endowment that he did not possess.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The shop bell rang. He sighed and put down his eyeglass. He didn't rush, though. There was a lot to look at in the shop. Sometimes he even had to cough to attract the customer's attention. That being said, sometimes Jeremy had to cough to attract the attention of his reflection when he was shaving.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy <em class="calibre9">tried </em>to be an interesting person. The trouble was that he was the kind of person who, having decided to be an interesting person, would first of all try to find a book called <em class="calibre9">How to Be An Interesting Person </em>and then see whether there were any courses available. He was puzzled that people seemed to think he was a boring conversationalist. Why, he could talk about all <em class="calibre9">kinds </em>of clock. Mechanical clocks, magical clocks, water clocks, fire clocks, floral clocks, candle clocks, sand clocks, cuckoo clocks, the rare Hershebian beetle clocks… But for some reason he always ran out of listeners before he ran out of clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stepped out into his shop, and stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh… I'm so sorry to have kept you,” he said. It was a <em class="calibre9">woman</em>. And two trolls had taken up positions just inside the door. Their dark glasses and huge ill-fitting black suits put them down as people who put people down. One of them cracked his knuckles when he saw Jeremy looking at him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The woman was wrapped in an enormous and expensive white fur coat, which might have explained the trolls. Long black hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her face was made up so pale that it was almost the shade of the coat. She was… quite attractive, thought Jeremy, who was admittedly no judge whatsoever, but it was a monochromatic beauty. He wondered if she was a zombie. There were quite a few in the city now, and the prudent ones <em class="calibre9">had </em>taken it with them when they died, and probably could afford a coat like that.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A <em class="calibre9">beetle </em>clock?” she said. She had turned away from the glass dome.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, er, yes… The Hershebian lawyer beetle has a very consistent daily routine,” said Jeremy. “I, er, only keep it for, um, interest.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How very… organic,” said the woman. She stared at him as if he was another kind of beetle. “We are Myria LeJean. <em class="calibre9">Lady </em>Myria LeJean.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy obediently held out a hand. Patient men at the Clockmakers' Guild had spent a long time teaching him how to Relate to People before giving it up in despair, but some things had stuck.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her ladyship looked at the waiting hand. Finally, one of the trolls lumbered over.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Der lady does not shake hands,” it said, in a reverberating whisper. “She are not a tactile kinda person.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But enough of this, perhaps,” said Lady LeJean, stepping back. “You make clocks, and we—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a jingling noise from Jeremy's shirt pocket. He pulled out a large watch.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If that was chiming the hour, you are fast,” said the woman.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… um… no… you might find it a good idea to, um, put your hands over your ears…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was three o'clock. And every clock struck it at once. Cuckoos cuckooed, the hour pins fell out of the candle clock, the water clocks gurgled and seesawed as the buckets emptied, bells clanged, gongs banged, chimes tinkled and the Hershebian lawyer beetle turned a somersault.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The trolls had clapped their huge hands over their ears, but Lady LeJean merely stood with her hands on her hips, head on one side, until the last echo died away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All correct, we see,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?” said Jeremy. He'd been thinking: perhaps a vampire, then?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You keep all your clocks at the right time,” said Lady LeJean. “You're very <em class="calibre9">particular </em>about that, Mr Jeremy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A clock that doesn't tell the right time is… wrong,” said Jeremy. Now he was wishing she'd go away. Her eyes were worrying him. He'd heard about people having grey eyes, and her eyes <em class="calibre9">were </em>grey, like the eyes of a blind person, but she was clearly looking at him and through him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, there was a little bit of trouble over that, wasn't there?” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I… I don't… I don't… don't know what you're—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“At the Clockmakers' Guild? Williamson, who kept his clock five minutes fast? And you—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am much better now,” said Jeremy stiffly. “I have medicine. The Guild was very kind. Now please go away.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr Jeremy, we want you to build us a clock that is accurate.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All my clocks are accurate,” said Jeremy, staring at his feet. He wasn't due to take his medicine for another five hours and seventeen minutes, but he was feeling the need for it now. “And now I must ask—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How accurate are your clocks?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Better than a second in eleven months,” said Jeremy promptly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is very good?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.” It had been <em class="calibre9">very </em>good. That was why the Guild had been so understanding. Genius is always allowed some leeway, once the hammer has been pried from its hands and the blood has been cleaned up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We want much better accuracy than that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It can't be done.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh? You mean that you can't do it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, I can't. And if I can't, then neither can any other clockmaker in the city. I'd know about it if they could!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So proud? Are you sure?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'd know.” And he would. He'd know for certain. The candle clocks and the water clocks… they were toys, which he kept out of a sort of respect for the early days of timekeeping, and even then he'd spent weeks experimenting with waxes and buckets and had turned out primitive clocks that you could, well, very nearly set your watch by. It was okay that they couldn't be <em class="calibre9">that </em>accurate. They were simple, organic things, parodies of time. They didn't grind across his nerves. But a real clock… well, that was a mechanism, a thing of numbers, and numbers had to be perfect.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She put her head on one side again. “How do you <em class="calibre9">test </em>to that accuracy?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They'd often asked him that in the Guild, once his talent had revealed itself. He hadn't been able to answer the question then, either, because it didn't make <em class="calibre9">sense</em>. You built a clock to be accurate. A portrait painter painted a picture. If it looked like the subject, then it was an accurate picture. If you built the clock right, it would be accurate. You didn't have to test it. You'd <em class="calibre9">know</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'd know,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">We </em>want you to build a clock that is <em class="calibre9">very </em>accurate.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How accurate?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Accurate</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I can only build to the limit of my materials,” said Jeremy. “I have… developed certain techniques, but there are things like… the vibration of the traffic in the street, little changes in temperature, that sort of thing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean was now inspecting a range of fat imp-powered watches. She picked one up and opened the back. There was the tiny saddle, and the pedals, but they were forlorn and empty.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No imps?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I keep them for historical interest,” said Jeremy. “They were barely accurate to a few seconds a minute, and they'd stop completely overnight. They were only any good if your idea of accuracy was ‘around two-ish’.” He grimaced when he used the term. It felt like hearing fingernails on a blackboard.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How about invar?” said the lady, still apparently inspecting the museum of clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy looked shocked. “The alloy? I didn't think anyone outside the Guild knew about that. And it is <em class="calibre9">very </em>expensive. Worth a lot more than its weight in gold.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean straightened up. “Money is no object,” she said. “Would invar allow you to reach total accuracy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. I already use it. It's true that it is not affected by temperature, but there are always… <em class="calibre9">barriers</em>. Smaller and smaller interferences become bigger and bigger problems. It's Xeno's Paradox.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, yes. He was the Ephebian philosopher who said you couldn't hit a running man with an arrow, wasn't he?” said the lady.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In theory, because—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But Xeno came up with four paradoxes, I believe,” said Lady LeJean. “They involved the idea that there is such a thing as the smallest possible unit of time. And it must exist, mustn't it? Consider the present. It must have a length, because one end of it is connected to the past and the other is connected to the future, and if it <em class="calibre9">didn't </em>have a length then the present couldn't exist at all. There would be no <em class="calibre9">time </em>for it to be the present in.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy was suddenly in love. He hadn't felt like this since he'd taken the back off the nursery clock when he was fourteen months old.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then you're talking about… the famous ‘tick of the universe’,” he said. “And no gear cutter could possibly make gears that small…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It depends on what you would call a gear. Have you read this?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean waved a hand at one of the trolls, who lumbered over and dropped an oblong package on the counter.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy undid it. It contained a small book. “<em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales</em>?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Read the story about the glass clock of Bad Schuschein,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Children's stories?” said Jeremy. “What can they tell me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who knows? We will call again tomorrow,” said Lady LeJean, “to hear about your plans. In the meantime, here is a little token of our good faith.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The troll laid a large leather bag on the counter. It clinked with the heavy, rich clink of gold. Jeremy didn't pay it a great deal of attention. He had quite a lot of gold. Even skilled clockmakers came to buy his clocks. Gold was useful because it gave him the time to work on more clocks. These earned him more gold. Gold was, more or less, something that occupied the space between clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can also obtain invar for you, in large quantities,” she said. “That will be part of your payment, although I agree that even invar will not serve your purpose. Mr Jeremy, both you and I know that your payment for making the first truly accurate clock <em class="calibre9">will be </em>the opportunity to make the first truly accurate clock, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He smiled nervously. “It would be… wonderful, if it could be done,” he said. “Really, it would… be the end of clockmaking.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Lady LeJean. “No one would ever have to make a clock again.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">This desk is neat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There is a pile of books on it, and a ruler.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There is also, at the moment, a clock made out of cardboard. Miss picked it up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other teachers in the school were known as Stephanie and Joan and so on, but to her class she was very strictly <em class="calibre9">Miss </em>Susan. “Strict”, in fact, was a word that seemed to cover everything about Miss Susan and, in the classroom, she insisted on the <em class="calibre9">Miss </em>in the same way that a king insists upon <em class="calibre9">Your Majesty</em>, and for pretty much the same reason.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan wore black, which the headmistress disapproved of but could do nothing about because black <em class="calibre9">was</em>, well, a respectable colour. She was young, but with an indefinable air of age about her. She wore her hair, which was blond-white with one black streak, in a tight bun. The headmistress disapproved of that, too—it suggested an Archaic Image of Teaching, she said, with the assurance of someone who could pronounce a capital letter. But she didn't ever dare disapprove of the way Miss Susan moved, because Miss Susan moved like a tiger.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was in fact always very hard to disapprove of Miss Susan in her presence, because if you did she gave you a Look. It was not in any way a threatening look. It was cool and calm. You just didn't want to see it again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Look worked in the classroom, too. Take homework, another Archaic Practice the headmistress was ineffectually Against. No dog ever ate the homework of one of Miss Susan's students, because there was something about Miss Susan that went home with them; instead the dog brought them a pen and watched imploringly while they finished it. Miss Susan seemed to have an unerring instinct for spotting laziness and effort, too. Contrary to the headmistress's instructions, Miss Susan did not let the children do what they liked. She let them do what she liked. It had turned out to be a lot more interesting for everyone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan held up the cardboard clock and said: “Who can tell me what this is?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A forest of hands shot up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Miranda?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a clock, miss.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan smiled, carefully avoided the hand that was being waved by a boy called Vincent, who was also making frantically keen “ooo, ooo, ooo” noises, and chose the one behind him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nearly right,” she said. “Yes, Samuel?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's all cardboard made to <em class="calibre9">look </em>like a clock,” said the boy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Correct. Always see what's really there. And I'm supposed to teach you to tell the time with this.” Miss Susan gave it a sneer and tossed it away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Shall we try a different way?” she said, and snapped her fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes!” the class chorused, and then it went “Aah!” as the walls, floor and ceiling dropped away and the desks hovered high over the city.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A few feet away was the huge cracked face of the tower clock of Unseen University.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The children nudged one another excitedly. The fact that their boots were over three hundred feet of fresh air didn't seem to bother them. Oddly, too, they did not seem <em class="calibre9">surprised</em>. This was just an interesting thing. They acted like connoisseurs who had seen other interesting things. You did, when you were in Miss Susan's class.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now, Melanie,” said Miss Susan, as a pigeon landed on her desk. “The big hand is on the twelve and the <em class="calibre9">enormous </em>hand is nearly on the ten, so it's…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Vincent's hand shot up. “Ooo, miss, ooo, ooo…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nearly twelve o'clock,” Melanie managed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done. But <em class="calibre9">here</em>…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air blurred. Now the desks, still in perfect formation, were firmly on the cobbles of a plaza in a different city. So was most of the classroom. There were the cupboards, and the Nature Table, and the blackboard. But the walls still lagged behind.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No one in the plaza paid the visitors any attention but, oddly, no one tried to walk into them either. The air was warmer, and smelled of sea and swamp.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Anyone know where this is?” said Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ooo, me, miss, ooo, ooo…” Vincent could only stretch his body taller if his feet left the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How about you, Penelope?” said Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, <em class="calibre9">miss</em>,” said a deflated Vincent.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Penelope, who was beautiful, docile and frankly dim, looked around at the thronged square and the whitewashed, awning-hung buildings with an expression close to panic.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We came here in geography last week,” said Miss Susan. “City surrounded by swamps. On the Vieux river. Famous cookery. Lots of seafood…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Penelope's exquisite brow creased. The pigeon on Miss Susan's desk fluttered down and joined the pigeon flock prospecting for scraps among the flagstones, cooing gently to the others in pidgin pigeon.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Aware that a lot could happen while people waited for Penelope to complete a thought process, Miss Susan waved at a clock on a shop across the square and said: “And who can tell me the time here in Genua, please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ooo, miss, <em class="calibre9">miss</em>, ooo…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A boy called Gordon cautiously admitted that it might be three o'clock, to the audible disappointment of the inflatable Vincent.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right,” said Miss Susan. “Can anyone tell me why it's three o'clock in Genua while it's twelve o'clock in Ankh-Morpork?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no avoiding it this time. If Vincent's hand had gone up any faster it would have fried by air friction. “<em class="calibre9">Yes</em>, Vincent?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ooo miss speed of light miss it goes at six hundred miles an hour and at the moment the sun's rising on the Rim near Genua so twelve o'clock takes three hours to get to us miss!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan sighed. “Very good, Vincent,” she said, and stood up. Every eye in the room watched her as she crossed over to the Stationery Cupboard. It seemed to have travelled with them and now, if there had been anyone to note such things, they might have seen faint lines in the air that denoted walls and windows and doors. And if they were intelligent observers, they'd have said: so… this classroom is in some way still in Ankh-Morpork <em class="calibre9">and also </em>in Genua, is it? Is this a trick? Is this real? Is it imagination? or is it that, to this particular teacher, there is not much of a difference?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre9">inside </em>of the cupboard was also present, and it was in that shadowy, paper-smelling recess that she kept <em class="calibre9">the stars</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were gold stars and silver stars. One gold star was worth three silver ones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The headmistress disapproved of these, as well. She said they encouraged Competitiveness. Miss Susan said that was the point, and the headmistress scuttled away before she got a Look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Silver stars weren't awarded frequently and gold stars happened less than once a fortnight, and were vied for accordingly. Right now Miss Susan selected a silver star. Pretty soon Vincent the Keen would have a galaxy of his very own. To give him his due, he was quite uninterested in which kind of star he got. Quantity, that was what he liked. Miss Susan had privately marked him down as Boy Most Likely to Be Killed One Day By His Wife.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She walked back to her desk and laid the star, tantalizingly, in front of her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And an <em class="calibre9">extra-special </em>question,” she said, with a hint of malice. “Does that mean it's ‘then’ there when it's ‘now’ here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The hand slowed halfway in its rise.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ooo…” Vincent began, and then stopped. “Doesn't make sense, miss…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Questions don't have to make sense, Vincent,” said Miss Susan. “But answers do.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a kind of sigh from Penelope. To Miss Susan's surprise the face that one day would surely cause her father to have to hire bodyguards was emerging from its normal happy daydream and wrapping itself around an answer. Her alabaster hand was rising, too.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The class watched expectantly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Penelope?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's always now everywhere, miss?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly right. Well done! All right, Vincent, you can have the silver star. And for you, Penelope…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan went back to the cupboard of stars. Getting Penelope to step off her cloud long enough even to answer a question was worth a star, but a deep philosophical statement like that had to make it a gold one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I want you all to open your notebooks and write down what Penelope just told us,” she said brightly as she sat down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then she saw the inkwell on her desk beginning to rise like Penelope's hand. It was a ceramic pot, made to drop neatly into a round hole in the woodwork. It came up smoothly, and turned out to be balanced on the cheerful skull of the Death of Rats.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It winked one blue-glowing eye socket at Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">With quick little movements, not even looking down, she whisked the inkwell aside with one hand and reached for a thick volume of stories with the other. She brought it down so hard on the hole that blue-black ink splashed onto the cobbles.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she raised the desk lid and peeped inside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was, of course, nothing there. At least, nothing macabre…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…Unless you counted the piece of chocolate half-gnawed by rat teeth and a note in heavy gothic lettering saying:</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <strong class="calibre12">SEE ME</strong>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">and signed by a very familiar alpha-and-omega symbol and the word </div>

        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan picked up the note and screwed it into a ball, aware that she was trembling with rage. How <em class="calibre9">dare </em>he? And to send the rat, too!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She tossed the ball into the wastepaper basket. She never missed. Sometimes the basket moved in order to ensure that this was the case.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now we'll go and see what the time is in Klatch,” she told the watching children.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the desk, the book had fallen open at a certain page. And, later on, it would be story time. And Miss Susan would wonder, too late, why the book had been on her desk when she had never even seen it before.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And a splash of blue-black ink would stay on the cobbles of the square in Genua, until the evening rainstorm washed it away.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">The first words that are read by seekers of enlightenment in the secret, gong-banging, yeti-haunted valleys near the hub of the world are when they look into the Life of Wen the Eternally Surprised.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The first question they ask is: “Why was he eternally surprised?”</div>

Therefore, he understood, there is in truth no Past, only a memory of the Past. Blink your eyes, and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them. Therefore, he said, the only appropriate state of the mind is surprise. The only appropriate state of the heart is joy. The sky you see now, you have never seen before. The perfect moment is now.

      <div class="paragraph">The Master of Novices met with Rinpo, chief acolyte to the abbot. At the moment, at least, the position of chief acolyte was a very important post. In his current condition the abbot needed many things done for him, and his attention span was low. In circumstances like this, there is always someone willing to carry the load. There are Rinpos everywhere.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's Ludd again,” said the Master of Novices.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, dear. Surely one naughty child can't trouble you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One <em class="calibre9">ordinary </em>naughty child, no. Where is this one from?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Master Soto sent him. You know? Of our Ankh-Morpork section? He found him in the city. The boy has a natural talent, I understand,” said Rinpo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Master of Novices looked shocked. “Talent! He is a wicked thief! He'd been apprenticed to the Guild of Thieves!” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well? Children sometimes steal. Beat them a little, and they stop stealing. Basic education,” said Rinpo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. There <em class="calibre9">is </em>a problem.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He is very, very fast. Around him, things go missing. Little things. Unimportant things. But even when he is watched closely, he is never seen to take them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then perhaps he does not?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He walks through a room and things vanish!” said the Master of Novices.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's <em class="calibre9">that </em>fast? It's just as well Soto <em class="calibre9">did </em>find him, then. But a thief is—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They turn up later, in odd places,” said the Master of Novices, apparently grudging the admission. “He does it out of mischief, I'm sure.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The breeze blew the scent of cherry blossom across the terrace.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, I am used to disobedience,” said the Master of Novices. “That is part of a novice's life. But he is also tardy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Tardy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He turns up late for his lessons.” “How can a pupil be tardy <em class="calibre9">here</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr Ludd doesn't seem to care. Mr Ludd seems to think he can do as he pleases. He is also… smart.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The acolyte nodded. Ah. Smart. The word had a very specific meaning here in the valley. A smart boy thought he knew more than his tutors, and answered back, and interrupted. A smart boy was worse than a stupid one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He does not accept discipline?” said the acolyte.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yesterday, when I was taking the class for Temporal Theory in the Stone Room, I caught him just staring at the wall. <em class="calibre9">Clearly </em>not paying attention. But when I called out to him to answer the problem I'd chalked on the blackboard, knowing full well that he could not, he did so. Instantly. And correctly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well? You did say he was a smart boy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Master of Novices looked embarrassed. “Except… it was not the right problem. I had been instructing the Fifth Djim field agents earlier and had left part of the test on the board. An <em class="calibre9">extremely </em>complex phase-space problem involving residual harmonics in <em class="calibre9">n </em>histories. None of <em class="calibre9">them </em>got it right. To be honest, even I had to look up the answer.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So I take it you punished him for not answering the right question?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Obviously. But that sort of behaviour is disruptive. Most of the time I think he's not all there. He never pays attention, he always knows the answers, and he can never tell you how he knows. We can't <em class="calibre9">keep </em>thrashing him. He is a bad example to the other pupils. There's no educating a <em class="calibre9">smart </em>boy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The acolyte thoughtfully watched a flight of white doves circle the monastery roofs. “We cannot send him away now,” he said at last. “Soto said he saw him perform the Stance of the Coyote! That's how he was found! Can you <em class="calibre9">imagine </em>that? He'd had no training at all! Can you <em class="calibre9">imagine </em>what would happen if someone with that kind of skill ran around loose? Thank goodness Soto was alert.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But he has turned him into my problem. The boy disrupts tranquillity.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rinpo sighed. The Master of Novices was a good and conscientious man, he knew, but it had been a long time since he'd been out in the world. People like Soto spent every day in the world of time. They learned flexibility, because if you were stiff out there you were dead. People like Soto… now, <em class="calibre9">there </em>was an idea…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked towards the other end of the terrace, where a couple of servants were sweeping up the fallen cherry blossom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see a harmonious solution,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An unusually talented boy like Ludd needs a master, not the discipline of the schoolroom.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Possibly, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Master of Novices followed Rinpo's gaze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh,” he said, and he smiled in a way that was not entirely nice. It contained a certain anticipatory element, a hint that trouble might be in store for someone who, in his opinion, richly deserved it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A name occurs,” said Rinpo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To me also,” said the Master of Novices.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A name I've heard too often,” Rinpo went on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I suppose that either he will break the boy, or the boy will break him, or it is always possible that they will break each other…” the Master mused.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So, in the patois of the world,” said Rinpo, “there is no actual <em class="calibre9">downside</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Would the abbot approve, though?” said the Master, testing a welcome idea for any weak points. “He has always had a certain rather tiresome regard for… the sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The abbot is a dear kind man but at the moment his teeth are giving him trouble and he is not walking at all well,” said Rinpo. “And these are difficult times. I'm sure he will be pleased to accept our joint recommendation. Why, it's practically a minor matter of day-to-day affairs.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And thus the future was decided.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They were not bad men. They had worked hard on behalf of the valley for hundreds of years. But it is possible, after a while, to develop certain dangerous habits of thought. One is that, while all important enterprises need careful organization, it is the organization that needs organizing, rather than the enterprise. And another is that tranquillity is always a good thing.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">There was a row of alarm clocks on the table by Jeremy's bed. He did not need them, because he woke up when he wanted to. They were there for testing. He set them for seven, and woke up at 6.59 to check that they went off on time. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Tonight he went to bed early, with a drink of water and the <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He had never been interested in stories, at any age, and had never quite understood the basic concept. He'd never read a work of fiction all the way through. He did remember, as a small boy, being really annoyed at the depiction of Hickory Dickory Dock in a rag book of nursery rhymes, because the clock in the drawing was completely wrong for the period.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He tried to read <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales</em>. They had titles like “How the Wicked Queen Danced in Red Hot Shoes!” and “The Old Lady in the Oven”. There was simply no mention of clocks of any sort in <em class="calibre9">any </em>of them. Their authors seemed to have a thing about not mentioning clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Glass Clock of Bad Schuschein”, on the other hand, <em class="calibre9">did </em>have a clock. Of a sort. And it was… odd. A wicked man—readers could see he was wicked because it <em class="calibre9">said </em>he was wicked, right there on the page—built a clock of glass in which he captured Time herself, but things went wrong because there was one part of the clock, a spring, that he couldn't make out of glass, and it broke under the strain. Time was set free and the man aged ten thousand years in a second and crumbled to dust and—not surprisingly, in Jeremy's opinion—was never seen again. The story ended with a moral: Large Enterprises Depend upon Small Details. Jeremy couldn't see why it couldn't just as well have been: It's Wrong to Trap Non-Existent Women in Clocks, or: It Would Have Worked with a Glass Spring.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But even to Jeremy's inexperienced eye, there was something wrong with the whole story. It read as though the writer was trying to make sense of something he'd seen, or been told, and had misunderstood. And—hah!—although it was set hundreds of years ago when even in Uberwald there were only natural cuckoo clocks, the artist had drawn a long-case clock of the sort that wasn't around even fifteen years ago. The stupidity of some people! You'd laugh if it wasn't so tragic!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He put the book aside and spent the rest of the evening doing a little design work for the Guild. They paid him handsomely for this, provided he promised never to turn up in person.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then he put the work on the bedside table by the clocks. He blew out the candle. He went to sleep. He dreamed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">The glass clock ticked. It stood in the middle of the workshop's wooden floor, giving off a silvery light. Jeremy walked around it, or perhaps it spun gently around him</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">It was taller than a man. Within the transparent case red and blue lights twinkled like stars. The air smelled of acid</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Now his point of view dived into the thing, the crystalline thing, plunging down through the layers of glass and quartz. They rose past him, their smoothness becoming walls hundreds of miles high, and still he fell between slabs that were becoming rough, grainy</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…<em class="calibre9">full of holes. The blue and red light was here too, pouring past him</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">And only now was there sound. It came from the darkness ahead, a slow beat that was ridiculously familiar, a heartbeat magnified a million times</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">…<strong class="calibre12">tchum…tchum</strong>…</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">…<em class="calibre9">each beat slower than mountains and bigger than worlds, dark and blood red. He heard a few more and then his fall slowed, stopped, and he began to soar back up through the sleeting light until a brightness ahead became a room</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">He had to remember all this! It was all so clear, once you saw it! So simple! So easy! He could see every part, how they interlocked, how they were made</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">And now it began to fade </em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Of course it was only a dream. He told himself that and was comforted by it. But he had gone to some lengths with this one, he had to admit. For example, there was a mug of tea steaming on the nearby workbench, and the sound of voices on the other side of the door</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a knocking at the door. Jeremy wondered if the dream would end when the door was opened, and then the door disappeared and the knocking went on. It was coming from downstairs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The time was 6.47. Jeremy glanced at the alarm clocks to make sure they were right, then pulled his dressing gown around him and hurried downstairs. He opened the front door a crack. There was no one there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nah, dahn 'ere, mister.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Someone lower down was a dwarf.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Name of Clockson?” it said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A clipboard was thrust through the gap.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sign 'ere, where it says ‘Sign 'Ere’. Thank you. Okay, lads…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Behind him, a couple of trolls tipped up a handcart. A large wooden crate crashed onto the cobbles.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What <em class="calibre9">is </em>this?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Express package,” said the dwarf, taking the clipboard. “Come all the way from Uberwald. Must've cost someone a packet. Look at all them seals and stickers on it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can't you bring it in—?” Jeremy began, but the cart was already moving off, with the merry jingle and tinkle of fragile items.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It started to rain. Jeremy peered at the label on the crate. It was certainly addressed to him, in a neat round hand, and just above it was the seal with the double-headed bat of Uberwald. There was no other marking except, near the bottom, the words:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <img src="marking.png" class="calibre13"/>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then the crate started to swear. It was muffled, and in a foreign language, but all swearing has a certain international content.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… hello?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The crate rocked, and landed on one of the long sides, with extra cursing. There was some thumping from inside, some <em class="calibre9">louder </em>swearing, and the crate teetered upright again with the alleged top the right way up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A piece of board slid aside and a crowbar dropped out and onto the street with a clang. The voice that had lately been swearing said, “If you would be tho good?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy inserted the bar into a likely-looking crack, and pulled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The crate sprang apart. He dropped the bar. There was a… a <em class="calibre9">creature </em>inside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know,” it said, pulling bits of packing material off itself. “Eight bloody dayth with no problemth, and thothe idiotth get it wrong on the doorthtep.” It nodded at Jeremy. “Good morning, thur. I thuppothe you <em class="calibre9">are </em>Mithter Jeremy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My name ith Igor, thur. My credentialth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A hand like an industrial accident held together with stitches thrust a sheaf of papers towards Jeremy. He recoiled instinctively, and then felt embarrassed and took them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think there has been a mistake,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, no mithtake,” said Igor, pulling a carpet bag out of the ruins of the crate. “You need an athithtant. And when it cometh to athithtantth, you cannot go wrong with an Igor. Everyone knowth that. Could we go in out of the rain, thur? It maketh my kneeth rutht.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I don't <em class="calibre9">need </em>an assist—” Jeremy began, but that was wrong, wasn't it? He just couldn't <em class="calibre9">keep </em>assistants. They always left within a week.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Morning, sir!” said a cheery voice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Another cart had pulled up. This one was painted a gleaming, hygienic white and was full of milk churns, and had “Ronald Soak, Dairyman” painted on the side. Distracted, Jeremy looked up at the beaming face of Mr Soak, who was holding a bottle of milk in each hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One pint, squire, as per usual. And perhaps another one if you've got company?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, er, er… yes, thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And the yoghurt is particularly fine this week, squire,” said Mr Soak encouragingly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, er, I think not, Mr Soak.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Need any eggs, cream, butter, buttermilk or cheese?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not as such, Mr Soak.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right you are, then,” said Mr Soak, unabashed. “See you tomorrow, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, yes,” said Jeremy, as the cart moved on. Mr Soak was a friend, which in Jeremy's limited social vocabulary meant “someone I speak to once or twice a week”. He approved of the milkman, because he was regular and punctual and had the bottles at the doorstep every morning on the stroke of 7a.m. “Er, er… goodbye,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He turned to Igor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did you <em class="calibre9">know </em>I needed—” he tried. But the strange man had gone indoors, and a frantic Jeremy tracked him down in the workshop.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh <em class="calibre9">yeth</em>, very nithe,” said Igor, who was taking it all in with the air of a connoisseur. “Thatth a Turnball Mk3 micro-lathe, ithn't it? I thaw it in their catalogue. Very nithe indee—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't ask anyone for an assistant!” said Jeremy. “Who sent you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We are Igorth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, you said! Look, I don't—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thur. ‘We R Igorth’, thur. The <em class="calibre9">organithathion</em>, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What organization?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“For <em class="calibre9">plathementh</em>, thur. You thee, thur, the thing ith… an Igor often findth himthelf between marthterth through no fault of hith own, you thee. And on the other hand—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—you have two thumbs…” breathed Jeremy, who had just noticed and couldn't stop himself. “Two on each hand!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yeth thur, very handy,” said Igor, not even glancing down. “On the <em class="calibre9">other</em> hand there ith no thortage of people wanting an Igor. Tho my Aunt Igorina runth our thelect little agenthy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“For… <em class="calibre9">lots</em> of Igors?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, there'th a fair number of uth. We're a big family.” Igor handed Jeremy a card.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He read:</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <strong class="calibre12">We R Igors</strong>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<strong class="calibre12">A Spare Hand When Needed</strong>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Old Rathaus</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Bad Schuschein</div>
      <div class="paragraph">c-mail: Yethmarthter Uberwald</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy stared at the semaphore address. His normal ignorance of anything that wasn't to do with clocks did not apply here. He'd been quite interested in the new cross-continent semaphore system after hearing that it made quite a lot of use of clockwork mechanisms to speed up the message flow. So you could send a clacks message to hire an Igor? Well, that explained the speed, at least.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Rathaus,” he said. “That means something like a council hall, doesn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Normally, thur… <em class="calibre9">normally</em>,” said Igor reassuringly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you really have semaphore addresses in Uberwald?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yeth. We are ready to grathp the future with both handth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—And four thumbs—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur. We can grathp like <em class="calibre9">anything</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And then you <em class="calibre9">mailed </em>yourself here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thertainly, thur. We Igorth are no thtrangerth to dithcomfort.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy looked down at the paperwork he'd been handed, and a name caught his eye.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The top paper was signed. In a way, at least. There was a message in neat capitals, as neat as printing, and a name at the end. </div>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <strong class="calibre12">HE WILL BE USEFUL</strong>
        </div>
        <blockquote class="calibre11"><i class="calibre9">LEJEAN</i></blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <div class="paragraph">He remembered. “Oh, Lady LeJean is behind this. She had you sent to me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That'th correct, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Feeling that Igor was expecting more of him, Jeremy made a show of reading through the rest of what turned out to be references. Some of them were written in what he could only hope was dried brown ink, one was in crayon, and several were singed around the edges. They were all fulsome. After a while, though, a certain tendency could be noted amongst the signatories.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This one is signed by someone called Mad Doctor Scoop,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, he wathn't actually <em class="calibre9">named </em>Mad, thur. It wath more like a nickname, ath it were.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Was he mad, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who can thay, thur?” said Igor calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And Crazed Baron Haha? It says under Reason for Leaving that he was crushed by a burning windmill.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Cathe of mithtaken identity, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur. I underthtand the mob mithtook him for Thcreaming Doctor Bertherk, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. Ah, yes.” Jeremy glanced down. “Who you also worked for, I see.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And who died of blood poisoning?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur. Cauthed by a dirty pitchfork.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And… Nipsie the Impaler?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, would you believe he ran a kebab thop, thur?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Did he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not <em class="calibre9">conventhionally </em>tho, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean he was mad too?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Well, he did have hith little wayth, I mutht admit, but an Igor never patheth judgement on hith marthter or mithtreth, thur. That ith the Code of the Igorth, thur,” he added patiently. “It would be a funny old world if we were all alike, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy was completely baffled as to his next move. He'd never been very good at talking to people, and this, apart from Lady LeJean and a wrangle with Mr Soak over an unwanted cheese, was the longest conversation he'd had for a year. Perhaps it was because it was hard to think of Igor as coming under the heading of people. Until now, Jeremy's definition of “people” had not included anyone with more stitches than a handbag.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not <em class="calibre9">sure </em>I've got any work for you, though,” he said. “I've got a new commission, but I'm not sure how… anyway, <em class="calibre9">I'm </em>not insane!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thalth not compulthory, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've actually got a piece of paper that <em class="calibre9">says </em>I'm not, you know.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well <em class="calibre9">done</em>, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not many people have one of those!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very true, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I take medicine, you know.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done, thur,” said Igor. “I'll jutht go and make thome breakfatht, thall I? While you get drethed… marthter.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy clutched at his damp dressing gown. “I'll be down shortly,” he said, and hurried up the stairs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor's gaze took in the racks of tools. There was not a speck of dust on them; the files, hammers and pliers were ranged according to size, and the items on the work bench were positioned with geometrical exactitude.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He pulled open a drawer. Screws were laid in perfect rows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked around at the walls. They were bare, except for the shelves of clocks. This was surprising—even Dribbling Doctor Vibes had had a calendar on the wall, which added a splash of colour. Admittedly it was from the Acid Bath and Restraint Co., in Ugli, and the colour it splashed was mostly red, but at least it showed some recognition of a world outside the four walls.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor was puzzled. Igor had never worked for a sane person before. He'd worked for a number of… well, the world called them madmen, and he'd worked for several <em class="calibre9">normal </em>people, in that they only indulged in minor and socially acceptable insanities, but he couldn't recall ever working for a completely <em class="calibre9">sane</em> person.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Obviously, he reasoned, if sticking screws up your nose was madness, then numbering them and keeping them in careful compartments was sanity, which was the opposite—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ah. No. It wasn't, was it…?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He smiled. He was beginning to feel quite at home already.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze the sweeper was in his Garden of Five Surprises, carefully cultivating his mountains. His broom leaned against the hedge.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Above him, looming over the temple gardens, the big stone statue of Wen the Eternally Surprised sat with its face locked in its permanent wide-eyed expression of, yes, pleasant surprise.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As a hobby, mountains appeal to those people who in normal circumstances are said to have a great deal of time on their hands. Lu-Tze had no time at all. Time was something that largely happened to other people; he viewed it in the same way that people on the shore viewed the sea. It was big and it was out there, and sometimes it was an invigorating thing to dip a toe into, but you couldn't live in it all the time. Besides, it always made his skin wrinkle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the moment, in the never-ending, ever-recreated moment of this peaceful, sunlit little valley, he was fiddling with the little mirrors and shovels and morphic resonators and even stranger devices required to make a mountain grow to no more than six inches high.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The cherry trees were still in bloom. They always were in bloom, here. A gong rang, somewhere back in the temple. A flock of white doves took off from the monastery roof.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A shadow fell over the mountain.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze glanced at the person who had entered the garden. He made the perfunctory symbol of servitude to the rather annoyed-looking boy in novice's robes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, master?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am looking for the one they call Lu-Tze,” said the boy. “Personally, I don't think he really exists.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've got glaciation,” said Lu-Tze, ignoring this. “At last. See, master? It's only an inch long, but already it's carving its own little valley. Magnificent, isn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, yes, very good,” said the novice, being kind to an underling. “Isn't this the garden of Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean, Lu-Tze who is famous for his bonsai mountains?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The novice looked from the line of plates to the little wrinkled smiling man.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">You </em>are Lu-Tze? But you're just a sweeper! I've <em class="calibre9">seen </em>you cleaning out the dormitories! I've seen people kick you!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze, apparently not hearing this, picked up a plate about a foot across on which a small cinder cone was smoking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do you think of this, master?” he said. “Volcanic. And it is bloody hard to do, excuse my Klatchian.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The novice took a step forward, and leaned down and looked directly into the sweeper's eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was not often disconcerted, but he was now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre9">are </em>Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, lad. I am Lu-Tze.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The novice took a deep breath and thrust out a skinny arm. It was holding a small scroll.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“From the abbot… er, venerable one!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The scroll wobbled in the nervous hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Most people call me Lu-Tze, lad. Or ‘Sweeper’. Until they get to know me better, some call me ‘Get out of the way’,” said Lu-Tze, carefully wrapping up his tools. “I've never been very venerable, except in cases of bad spelling.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked around the saucers for the miniature shovel he used for glacial work, and couldn't see it anywhere. Surely he'd put it down just a moment ago?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The novice was watching him with an expression of awe mixed with residual suspicion. A reputation like Lu-Tze's got around. This was the man who had—well, who had done practically <em class="calibre9">everything,</em> if you listened to the rumours. But he didn't <em class="calibre9">look</em> as though he had. He was just a little bald man with a wispy beard and a faint, amiable smile.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze patted the young man on the shoulder in an effort to put him at his ease.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Let us see what the abbot wants,” he said, unrolling the rice paper. “Oh. You are to take me to see him, it says here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A look of panic froze the novice's face. “What? How can I do that? Novices aren't allowed inside the Inner Temple!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? In that case, let me take <em class="calibre9">you</em>, to take <em class="calibre9">me</em>, to see <em class="calibre9">him</em>,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You are allowed into the Inner Temple?” said the novice, and then put his hand over his mouth. “But you're just a swee—Oh…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right! Not even a proper monk, let alone a <em class="calibre9">dong</em>,” said the sweeper cheerfully. “Amazing, isn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But people <em class="calibre9">talk </em>about you as if you were as high as the abbot!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, dear me, no,” said Lu-Tze. “I'm nothing like as holy. Never really got a grip on the cosmic harmony.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you've done all those incredible—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I didn't say I'm not good at what I do,” said Lu-Tz:e, ambling away with his broom over his shoulder. “Just not holy. Shall we go?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… Lu-Tze?” said the novice, as they walked along the ancient brick path.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why is this called the Garden of Five Surprises?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What was your name back in the world, hasty young man?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Newgate. Newgate Ludd, ven—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze held up a warning finger. “Ah?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper, I mean.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ludd, eh? Ankh-Morpork lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper,” said the boy. The suddenly dejected tones suggested he knew what was coming next.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Raised by the Thieves' Guild? One of ‘Ludd's Lads’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The boy formerly known as Newgate looked the old man in the eye and, when he replied, it was in the singsong voice of someone who'd answered the question too many times. “Yes, Sweeper. Yes, I was a foundling. Yes, we get called Ludd's Lads and Lasses after one of the founders of the Guild. Yes, that's my <em class="calibre9">adopted </em>surname. Yes, it was a good life and sometimes I wish I still had it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze appeared not to hear this. “Who sent you here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A monk called Soto discovered me. He said I had talent.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Marco? The one with all the hair?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right. Only I thought the rule was that all monks were shaved.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, Soto says he <em class="calibre9">is </em>bald under the hair,” said Lu-Tze. “He says the hair is a separate creature that just happens to live on him. They gave him a field posting really <em class="calibre9">quickly </em>after he came up with that one. Hard-working fellow, mark you, and friendly as anything provided you don't touch his hair. Important lesson there: you don't survive in the field by obeying <em class="calibre9">all </em>the rules, including those relating to mental processes. And what name were you given when you were enrolled?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lobsang, ven—uh, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lobsang Ludd?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Amazing. So, Lobsang Ludd, you tried to count my surprises, did you? Everybody does. Surprise is the nature of Time, and five is the number of Surprise.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper. I found the little bridge that tilts and throws you into the carp pool…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. Good.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…and I have found the bronze sculpture of a butterfly that flaps its wings when you breathe on it…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's two.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's the surprising way those little daisies spray you with venomous pollen…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, yes. Many people find them extremely surprising.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I believe the fourth surprise is the yodelling stick insect.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done,” said Lu-Tze, beaming. “It's very good, isn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I can't find the fifth surprise.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? Let me know when you find it,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang Ludd thought about this as he trailed after the sweeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Garden of Five Surprises is a test,” he said, at last.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes. Nearly everything is.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang nodded. It was like the Garden of the Four Elements. Every novice found the bronze symbols of three of them—in the carp pond, under a rock, painted on a kite—but none of Lobsang's classmates found Fire. There didn't appear to be a fire anywhere in the garden.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After a while Lobsang had reasoned thus: there were in fact five elements, as they had been taught. Four made up the universe, and the fifth, Surprise, allowed it to keep on happening. No one had <em class="calibre9">said</em> that the four in the garden were the <em class="calibre9">material</em> four, so the fourth element in the Garden could be Surprise at the fact that Fire wasn't there. Besides, fire was not generally found in a garden, and the other signs were, truly, in their element. So he'd gone down to the bakeries and opened one of the ovens, and there, glowing red hot below the loaves, was Fire.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then… I expect that the fifth surprise is: there is no fifth surprise,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nice try, but no cylindrical smoking thing,” said Lu-Tze. “And is it not written, ‘Oo, you are so sharp you'll cut yourself one of these days’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Um, I haven't read that in the sacred texts yet, Sweeper,” said Lobsang uncertainly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, you wouldn't have,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They stepped out of the brittle sunlight into the deep cold of the temple, and walked on through ancient halls and down stairways cut into the rock. The sound of distant chanting followed them. Lu-Tze, who was not holy and therefore could think unholy thoughts, occasionally wondered whether the chanting monks were chanting <em class="calibre9">anything</em>, or were just going “aahaaahahah”. You could never tell with all that echo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He turned off the main passage and reached for the handles of a pair of large, red-lacquered doors. Then he looked behind him. Lobsang had stopped dead, some yards away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Coming?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But not even <em class="calibre9">dongs </em>are allowed in there!” said Lobsang. “You have to be a Third Djim <em class="calibre9">ting </em>at least!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah, right. It's a short-cut. Come on, it's draughty out here.” With extreme reluctance, expecting at any moment the outraged scream of authority, Lobsang trailed after the sweeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And he was just a sweeper! One of the people who swept the floors and washed the clothes and cleaned the privies! No one had ever mentioned it! Novices heard about Lu-Tze from their very first day—how he'd gone into some of the most tangled knots of time and unravelled them, how he'd constantly dodged the traffic on the crossroads of history, how he could divert time with a word and used this to develop the most subtle arts of battle…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…and here was a skinny little man who was sort of generically ethnic, so that he looked as if he could have come from anywhere, in a robe that had once been white before it fell to all those stains and patches, and the sandals repaired with string. And the friendly grin, as if he was constantly waiting for something amusing to happen. And <em class="calibre9">no belt at all</em>, just another piece of string to hold his robe closed. Even some novices got to the level of grey <em class="calibre9">dong </em>in their first year!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The dojo was busy with senior monks at practice. Lobsang had to dodge aside as a pair of fighters whirled past, arms and legs blurring as each sought an opening, paring time into thinner and thinner slivers—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You! Sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked round, but the shout had been directed at Lu-Tze. A <em class="calibre9">ting</em>, only just elevated to the Third Djim by the fresh look of his belt, was advancing on the little man, his face red with fury.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What for are you coming in here, cleaner of filth? This is forbidden!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's little smile didn't change. But he reached in his robe and brought out a small bag.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“'s a short-cut,” he said. He pulled a pinch of tobacco and, while the <em class="calibre9">ting </em>loomed over him, began to roll a cigarette. “And there's dirt everywhere, too. I'll certainly have a word with the man who does this floor.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How dare you insult!” screamed the monk. “Back to the kitchens with you, sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Cowering behind Lu-Tze, Lobsang realized that the entire dojo had stopped to watch this. One or two of the monks were whispering to one another. The man in the brown robe of the dojo master was watching impassively from his chair, with his chin on his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">With great and patient and infuriating delicacy, like a samurai arranging flowers, Lu-Tze marshalled the shreds of tobacco in the flimsy cigarette paper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, I reckon I'll go out of that door over there, if you don't mind,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Impudence! Then you are ready to fight, enemy of dust?” The man leapt back and raised his hands to form the Combat of the Hake. He spun round and planted a kick on a heavy leather sack, hitting it so hard that its supporting chain broke. Then he was back to face Lu-Tze, hands held in the Advancement of the Snake.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ai! Shao! Hai-eee—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The dojo master stood up. “Hold!” he commanded. “Do you not want to know the name of the man you are about to destroy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The fighter held his stance, glaring at Lu-Tze. “I don't need to know name of sweeper,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze rolled the cigarette into a skinny cylinder and winked at the angry man, which only stoked the anger.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is always wise to know the name of a sweeper, boy,” said the dojo master. “And my question was not addressed to you.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy stared at his bed sheets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They were covered in writing. His <em class="calibre9">own </em>writing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It trailed across the pillow and onto the wall. There were sketches, too, scored deeply into the plaster.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He found his pencil under the bed. He'd even sharpened it. In his sleep, he'd <em class="calibre9">sharpened </em>a pencil! And by the look of it he'd been writing and drawing for hours. Trying to draw a dream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">With, down one side of his eiderdown, a list of parts.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had all made absolute sense when he'd seen it, like a hammer or a stick or Wheelbright's Gravity Escapement. It had been like meeting an old friend. And now… He stared at the scrawled lines. He had been writing so fast he'd ignored punctuation and some of the letters, too. But he could see some sense in there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd heard of this sort of thing. Great inventions sometimes <em class="calibre9">did </em>arise from dreams and daydreams. Didn't Hepzibah Whitlow have the idea of the adjustable pendulum clock as a result of his work as the public hangman? Didn't Wilframe Balderton always say that the idea for the Fish Tail Escapement came after he'd eaten too much lobster?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Yes, it had all been so clear in the dream. By daylight, it needed a bit more work.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a clatter of dishes from the little kitchen behind his workshop. He hurried down, dragging the sheet behind him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I usually have—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Toatht, thur,” said Igor, turning away from the range. “Lightly browned, I thuthpect.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did you know that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An Igor learnth to antithipate, thur,” said Igor. “What a wonderful little kitchen, thur. I've never theen a drawer marked ‘Thpoonth’ which jutht hath thpoonth in it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you any good at working with glass, Igor?” said Jeremy, ignoring this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thur,” said Igor, buttering the toast.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're not?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thur. I am bloody <em class="calibre9">amathing </em>at it, thur. Many marthterth have needed… <em class="calibre9">thpethial </em>apparatuth not obtainable elthewhere, thur. What wath it you wanted?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How would we go about building <em class="calibre9">this</em>?” Jeremy spread the sheet on the table.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The slice of toast dropped from Igors black-nailed fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is there something wrong?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought thomeone wath walking over my grave, thur,” said Igor, still looking shocked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, you haven't actually ever <em class="calibre9">had </em>a grave, have you?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Jutht a figure of thpeech, thur, jutht a figure of thpeech,” said Igor, looking hurt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is an idea I've…I've had for a clock…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Glath Clock,” said Igor. “Yeth. I know about it. My grandfather Igor helped build the firtht one.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The first one? But it's just a story for children! And I dreamed about it, and—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Grandfather Igor alwayth thaid there wath thomething very thtrange about all that,” said Igor. “The ecthplothion and everything.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It exploded? Because of the metal spring?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not ecthactly an ecthplothion,” said Igor. “We're no thtrangerth to ecthplothionth, uth Igorth. It wath… <em class="calibre9">very odd</em>. And we're no thtrangerth to odd, either.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you telling me it really existed?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor seemed embarrassed about this. “Yeth,” he said, “and then again, no.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Things either exist or they don't,” said Jeremy. “I am very clear about that. I have medicine.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It ecthithted,” said Igor, “and then, after it did, it never had. Thith ith what my grandfather told me, and he built that clock with thethe very handth!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy looked down. Igor's hands were gnarled, and, now he came to look at them, had a lot of scar tissue around the wrists. “We really <em class="calibre9">believe </em>in heirloomth in our family,” said Igor, catching his gaze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sort of… hand-me-downs, ahahaha,” said Jeremy. He wondered where his medicine was.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very droll, thur,” said Igor. “But Grandfather Igor alwayth thaid that afterwardth it wath like… a dream, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A dream…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The workthop wath different. The clock wathn't there. Demented Doctor Wingle, that wath hith marthter at the time, wathn't working on the glath clock at all but on a way of ecthtracting thunthine from orangeth. Thingth were different and they alwayth had been, thur. Like it had never happened.” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it turned up in a book for children!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur. Bit of a conundrum, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy stared at the sheet with its burden of scribbles. An accurate clock. That's all it was. A clock that'd make all other clocks unnecessary, Lady LeJean had said. Building a clock like that would mean the clockmaker went down in timekeeping history. True, the book had said that Time had got trapped in the clock, but Jeremy had no interest whatsoever in things that were Made Up. Anyway, a clock just <em class="calibre9">measured</em>. Distance didn't get tangled up in a tape measure. All a clock did was count teeth on a wheel. Or… light…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Light with teeth</em>. He'd seen that in the dream. Light not as something bright in the sky, but as an excited line, going up and down like a wave.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Could <em class="calibre9">you</em>… build something like this?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor looked at the drawings again. “Yeth,” he said, nodding. Then he pointed to several large glass containers around the drawing of the central column of the clock. “And I know what thethe are,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In my dr—I mean, I imagined them as fizzing,” said Jeremy. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very, very thecret knowledge, thothe jarth,” said Igor, carefully ignoring the question. “Can you get copper rodth here, thur?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In Ankh-Morpork? Easily.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And thinc?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lots of it, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thulphuric athid?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“By the carboy, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I mutht have died and gone to heaven,” said Igor. “Jutht put me near enough copper and thinc and athid, thur,” he said, “and then we thall thee <em class="calibre9">thparkth</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“My name,” said Lu-Tze, leaning on his broom as the irate <em class="calibre9">ting</em> raised a hand, “is Lu-Tze.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The dojo went silent. The attacker paused in mid-bellow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—Ai! Hao<em class="calibre9">–gng! Gnh? Ohsheeeeeeohsheeeeeee</em>…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The man did not move but seemed instead to turn in on himself, sagging from the martial stance into a kind of horrified, penitent crouch.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze bent over and struck a match on his unprotesting chin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's <em class="calibre9">your </em>name, lad?” he said, lighting his ragged cigarette.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“His name is mud, Lu-Tze,” said the dojo master, striding forward. He gave the unmoving challenger a kick. “Well, Mud, you <em class="calibre9">know </em>the rules. Face the man you have challenged, or give up the belt.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The figure remained very still for a moment, and then cautiously, in a manner almost theatrically designed not to give offence, started to fumble with his belt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, no, we don't need that” said Lu-Tze kindly. “It was a good challenge. A decent ‘Ai!’ and a very passable ‘Hai-eee!’, I thought. Good martial gibberish all round, such as you don't often hear these days. And we would not want his trousers falling down at a time like this, would we?” He sniffed and added, “<em class="calibre9">Especially </em>at a time like this.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He patted the shrinking man on the shoulder. “Just you recall the rule your teacher here taught you on day one, eh? And… why don't you go and clean yourself up? I mean, some of us have to tidy up in here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then he turned and nodded to the dojo master.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“While I am here, master, I should like to show young Lobsang the Device of Erratic Balls.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The dojo master bowed deeply. “It is yours, Lu-Tze the Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As Lobsang followed the ambling Lu-Tze he heard the dojo master, who like all teachers never missed an opportunity to drive home a lesson, say: “Dojo! What is Rule One?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Even the cowering challenger mumbled along to the chorus:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do not act incautiously when confronting little bald wrinkly smiling men!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good rule, Rule One,” said Lu-Tze, leading his new acolyte into the next room. “I have met many people who could have heeded it to good advantage.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stopped, without looking at Lobsang Ludd, and held out his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now, if you please, you will return the little shovel you stole from me when first we met.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I came nowhere near you, master!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's smile did not flicker. “Oh. Yes. That is true. My apologies. The ramblings of an old man. Is it not written, ‘I'd forget my own head if it wasn't nailed on’? Let us proceed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The floor in here was wood, but the walls were high and padded. There were reddish-brown stains here and there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, we have one of these in the novices' dojo, Sweeper,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the balls in that are made of soft leather, yes?” said the old man, approaching a tall wooden cube. A row of holes ran halfway up the side that faced down the length of the room. “And they travel quite slowly, I recall.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, yes,” said Lobsang, watching him pull on a very large lever. Down below there was the sound of metal on metal, and then of urgent gushing water. Air began to wheeze from joints in the box. “These are wooden,” said Lu-Tze calmly. “Catch one.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Something touched Lobsang's ear and behind him the padding shook as a ball buried itself deeply and then dropped to the floor. “Perhaps a <em class="calibre9">shade </em>slower…” said Lu-Tze, turning a knob.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After fifteen random balls, Lobsang caught one in his stomach. Lu-Tze sighed and pushed the big lever back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper, I'm not used to—” said the boy, picking himself up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I knew you wouldn't <em class="calibre9">catch </em>one,” said Lu-Tze. “Even our boisterous friend out there in the dojo wouldn't catch one at that speed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you said you had slowed it down!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only so that it wouldn't kill you. Just a test, see. Everything's a test. Let's go, lad. Can't keep the abbot waiting.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Trailing cigarette smoke, Lu-Tze ambled away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang followed, getting more and more nervous. This <em class="calibre9">was </em>Lu-Tze, the dojo had proved that. And he knew it, anyway. He'd looked at the little round face as it gazed amicably at the angry fighter and <em class="calibre9">known </em>it. But… just a sweeper? No insignia? No status? Well, obviously status, because the dojo master couldn't have bowed lower for the abbot, but…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And now he was following the man along passages where even a monk was not allowed to go, on pain of death. Sooner or later, there was surely going to be trouble.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper, I really ought to be back at my duties in the kitchens—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes. Kitchen duties,” said Lu-Tze. “To teach you the virtues of obedience and hard work, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are they working?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh… yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well… no.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're not all they're cracked up to be, I have to tell you,” said Lu-Tze. “Whereas, my lad, what we have here,” he stepped through an archway, “is an education!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was the biggest room Lobsang had ever seen. Shafts of light speared down from glazed holes in the roof. And below, more than a hundred yards across and tended by senior monks who walked above it on delicate wire walkways…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang had heard about the Mandala.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was as if someone had taken tons of coloured sands and thrown them across the floor in a great swirl of coloured chaos. But there was order fighting for survival in the chaos, rising and falling and spreading. Millions of randomly tumbling sand grains would nevertheless make a piece of pattern, which would replicate and spread across the circle, rebounding or merging with other patterns and eventually dissolving into the general disorder. It happened again and again, turning the Mandala into a silent raging war of colour.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stepped out onto a frail-looking wood-and-rope bridge.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?” he said. “What d'you think?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang took a deep breath. He felt that if he fell off the bridge he'd drop into the surging colours and never, ever hit the floor. He blinked and rubbed his forehead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's… evil,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said Lu-Tze. “Not many people say that the first time. They use words like ‘wonderful’.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's going wrong!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang clutched the rope railing. “The patterns—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“History repeating,” said Lu-Tze. “They're always there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, they're—” Lobsang tried to take it all in. There were patterns <em class="calibre9">under </em>the patterns, disguised as part of the chaos. “I mean… the <em class="calibre9">other </em>patterns…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He slumped forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air was cold, the world was spinning, and the ground rushed up to enfold him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And stopped, a few inches away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air around him sizzled, as though it was being gently fried.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Newgate Ludd?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze?” he said. “The Mandala is…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But where were the colours? Why was the air wet and smelling of the city? And then the ghost memories faded away. As they disappeared, they said: How can we be memories, when we have yet to happen? Surely what you <em class="calibre9">remember </em>is climbing all the way up onto the roof of the Bakers' Guild and finding that someone had loosened all the capping stones, because <em class="calibre9">that </em>just happened?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And a last dying memory said, Hey, that was <em class="calibre9">months </em>ago…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, we're not Lu-Tze, mysterious falling kid,” said the voice that had addressed him. “Can you turn round?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Newgate managed, with great difficulty, to move his head. It felt as though he was stuck in tar.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A heavy young man in a grubby yellow robe was sitting on an upturned box a few feet away. He looked a bit like a monk, except for his hair, because his hair looked a bit like an entirely separate organism. To say that it was black and bound up in a ponytail is to miss the opportunity of using the term “elephantine”. It was hair with personality.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mostly my name's Soto,” said the man underneath. “Marco Soto. I won't bother memorizing yours until we know if you're going to live or not, eh? So tell me, have you ever considered the rewards of the spiritual life?” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right now? Certainly!” said… yes, Newgate, he thought, that's my name, yes? So why do I remember Lobsang? “Er, I was thinking about the possibility of taking up a new line of work!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good career move,” said Soto.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is this some kind of magic?” Newgate tried to move but hung, turning gently, in the air just above the waiting ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not exactly. You seem to have shaped time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me? How did I do that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't know?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah, will you listen to him?” said Soto, as if talking to a genial companion. “There's probably the spin time of a whole Procrastinator being used up to prevent your little trick causing untold harm to the entire world, and you don't know how you did it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then we'll train you. It's a good life, and it offers excellent prospects. At least,” he added, sniffing, “better than those that confront you now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Newgate strained to turn his head further. “Train me in what, exactly?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The man sighed. “Still asking questions, kid? Are you coming or not?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, I'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, do you understand?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why is it the opportunity of a lifetime, Mr Soto?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, you misunderstand me. <em class="calibre9">You</em>, that is Newgate Ludd, are being offered, that is by <em class="calibre9">me</em>, the opportunity of <em class="calibre9">having </em>a lifetime. Which is more than you will have shortly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Newgate hesitated. He was aware of a tingling in his body. In a sense, it was still falling. He didn't know <em class="calibre9">how </em>he knew this, but the knowledge was as real as the cobbles just below him. If he made the wrong choice the fall would simply continue. It had been easy so far. The last few inches would be terminally hard.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I must admit I don't like the way my life is going at the moment,” he said. “It may be advantageous to find a new direction.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good.” The be-haired man pulled something out of his robe. It looked like a folded abacus, but when he opened it up parts of it vanished with little flashes of light, as if they'd moved somewhere where they could not be seen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you doing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know what kinetic energy is?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's what you have far too much of.” Soto's fingers danced on the beads, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. “I imagine you weigh about a hundred and ten pounds, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He pocketed the little device and strolled off to a nearby cart. He did something that Newgate couldn't see, and came back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In a few seconds you will complete your fall,” he said, reaching under him to place something on the ground. “Try to think of it as a new start in life.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Newgate fell. He hit the ground. The air flashed purple and the laden cart across the street jerked a foot into the air and collapsed heavily. One wheel bounced away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Soto leaned down and shook Newgate's unresisting hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How do you do?” he said. “Any bruises?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It does hurt a bit,” said the shaken Newgate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Maybe you're a bit heavier than you look. Allow me…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Soto grabbed Newgate under the shoulders and began to tug him off into the mists.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can I go and—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the Guild—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't exist at the Guild.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's stupid, I'm in the Guild records.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, you're not. We'll see to that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How? You can't rewrite history!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bet you a dollar?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What have I joined?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're the most secret society that you can imagine.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? Who are you, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Monks of History.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Huh? I've never heard of you!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“See? That's how good we are.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And that was how good they were.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then the time had just flown past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And now the present came back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you all right, lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang opened his eyes. His arm felt as though it was being wrenched off his body.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked up along the length of the arm to Lu-Tze, who was lying flat on the swaying bridge, holding him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What happened?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think maybe you were overcome with the excitement, lad. Or vertigo, maybe. Just don't look down.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a roaring below Lobsang, like a swarm of very angry bees. Automatically, he began to turn his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">I said don't look down</em>! Just relax.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze got to his feet. He raised Lobsang, at arm's length, as though he was a feather, until the boy's sandals were over the wood of the bridge. Below, monks were running along the walkways and shouting.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now, keep your eyes shut… <em class="calibre9">don't look down</em>!… and I'll just walk us both to the far side, all right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I, er, I remembered… back in the city, when Soto found me… I remembered…” said Lobsang weakly, tottering along behind the monk.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only to be expected,” said Lu-Tze, “in the circumstances.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But, but I remember that back then I remembered about being here. You and the Mandala!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it not written in the sacred text, ‘There's a lot goes on we don't know about, in my opinion’?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I… have not yet come across that one either, Sweeper,” said Lobsang. He felt cooler air around him, which suggested they had reached the rock tunnel on the far side of the room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sadly, in the writings they have here you probably won't,” said Lu-Tze. “Ah, you can open your eyes now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They walked on, with Lobsang rubbing his head to take away the strangeness of his thoughts.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Behind them the livid swirls in the wheel of colour, which had centred on the spot where Lobsang would have fallen, gradually faded and healed.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">According to the First Scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised</em>, Wen and Clodpool reached the green valley between the towering mountains and Wen said: “This is the place. Here there will be a temple dedicated to the folding and unfolding of time. I can see it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't, master,” said Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen said, “It's over there.” He pointed, and his arm vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah,” said Clodpool. “Over <em class="calibre9">there</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A few cherry blossom petals drifted down onto Wen's head from one of the trees that grew wild along the streamlets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And this perfect day will last for ever,” he said. “The air is crisp, the sun is bright, there is ice in the streams. Every day in this valley will be <em class="calibre9">this </em>perfect day.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Could get a bit repetitive, master,” said Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is because you don't yet know how to deal with time,” said Wen. “But I will teach you to deal with time as you would deal with a coat, to be worn when necessary and discarded when not.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Will I have to wash it?” said Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen gave him a long, slow look. “That was either a very complex piece of thinking on your part, Clodpool, or you were just trying to overextend a metaphor in a rather stupid way. Which do you think it was?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool looked at his feet. Then he looked at the sky. Then he looked at Wen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think I am stupid, master.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good,” said Wen. “It is fortuitous that you are my apprentice at this time, because if I can teach you, Clodpool, I can teach <em class="calibre9">anyone</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool looked relieved, and bowed. “You do me too much honour, master.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And there is a second part to my plan,” said Wen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah,” said Clodpool, with an expression that he thought made him look wise, although in reality it made him look like someone remembering a painful bowel movement. “A plan with a second part is always a good plan, master.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Find me sands of all colours, and a flat rock. I will show you a way to make the currents of time visible.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, right.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And there is a third part to my plan.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A <em class="calibre9">third </em>part, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can teach a gifted few to control their time, to slow it and speed it up and store it and direct it like the water in these streams. But most people will not, I fear, let themselves become able to do this. We have to help them. We will have to build… devices that will store and release time to where it is needed, because men cannot progress if they are carried like leaves on a stream. People need to be able to waste time, make time, lose time and buy time. This will be our major task.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool's face twisted with the effort of understanding. Then he slowly raised a hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen sighed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to ask what happened to the coat, aren't you?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Clodpool nodded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Forget about the coat, Clodpool. The coat is not important. Just remember that you are the blank paper on which I will write—” Wen held up a hand as Clodpool opened his mouth. “Just another metaphor, just another metaphor. And now, please make some lunch.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Metaphorically or really, master?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Both.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A flight of white birds burst out of the trees and wheeled overhead before swooping off across the valley.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There will be doves,” said Wen, as Clodpool hurried off to light a fire. “Every day, there will be doves.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze left the novice in the anteroom. It might have surprised those who disliked him that he took a moment to straighten his robe before he entered the presence of the abbot, but Lu-Tze at least cared for people even if he did not care for rules. He pinched out his cigarette and stuck it behind his ear, too. He had known the abbot for almost six hundred years, and respected him. There weren't many people Lu-Tze respected. Mostly, they just got tolerated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Usually, the sweeper got on with people in inverse proportion to their local importance, and the reverse was true. The senior monks… well, there could be no such thing as bad thoughts amongst people so enlightened, but it is true that the sight of Lu-Tze ambling insolently through the temple did tarnish a few karmas. To a certain type of thinker the sweeper was a personal insult, with his lack of any formal education or official status and his silly little Way and his incredible successes. So it was surprising that the abbot liked him, because never had there been an inhabitant of the valley so unlike the sweeper, so learned, so impractical and so frail. But then, surprise is the nature of the universe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze nodded to the minor acolytes who opened the big varnished doors.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How is his reverence today?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The teeth are still giving him trouble, O Lu-Tze, but he is maintaining continuity and has just taken his first steps in a very satisfactory manner.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I thought I heard the gongs.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The group of monks clustered in the centre of the room stepped aside as Lu-Tze approached the playpen. It was, unfortunately, necessary. The abbot had never mastered the art of circular ageing. He had therefore been forced to achieve longevity in a more traditional way, via serial reincarnation.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, Sweeper,” he burbled, awkwardly tossing aside a yellow ball and brightening up. “And how are the mountains? <em class="calibre9">Wanna bikkit wanna bikkit</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm definitely getting vulcanism, Reverend One. It's very encouraging.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you are in persistent good health?” said the abbot, while his pudgy little hand banged a wooden giraffe against the bars.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Your Reverence. It's good to see you up and about again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only for a few steps so far, alas <em class="calibre9">bikkit bikkit wanna bikkit</em>. Unfortunately, young bodies have a mind of their own <em class="calibre9">BIKKIT</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You sent me a message, Your Reverence? It said, ‘Put this one to the test.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And what did you think of our <em class="calibre9">want bikkit want bikkit want bikkit NOW </em>young Lobsang Ludd?” An acolyte hurried forward with a plate of rusks. “Would you care for a rusk, by the way?” the abbot added. “<em class="calibre9">Mmmm nicey bikkit</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, Reverend One, I have all the teeth I need,” said the sweeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ludd is a puzzle, is he not? His tutors have <em class="calibre9">nicey bikkit mmm mmm bikkit </em>told me he is very talented but somehow not all there. But you have never met him and don't know his history and so <em class="calibre9">mmm bikkit </em>and so I would value your uninfluenced observations <em class="calibre9">mmm BIKKIT</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He is beyond fast,” said Lu-Tze. “I think he may begin to react to things before they happen.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How can anyone tell that? <em class="calibre9">Want teddy want teddy wanna wanna TEDDY</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I put him in front of the Device of Erratic Balls in the senior dojo and he was moving towards the right hole fractionally before the ball came out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Some kind of <em class="calibre9">gurgle </em>telepathy, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If a simple machine has a mind of its own I think we're in really big trouble,” said Lu-Tze. He took a deep breath. “And in the hall of the Mandala he saw the patterns in the chaos.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You let a neophyte see the <em class="calibre9">Mandala</em>?” said chief acolyte Rinpo, horrified.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If you want to see if someone can swim, push him in the river,” said Lu-Tze, shrugging. “What other way is there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But to look at it without the proper training—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He saw the patterns,” said Lu-Tze. “And <em class="calibre9">reacted </em>to the Mandala.” He did not add: and the Mandala reacted to him. He wanted to think about that. When you look into the abyss, it's not supposed to wave back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was <em class="calibre9">teddyteddyteddywahwah </em>strictly forbidden, even so,” said the abbot. Clumsily, he fumbled among the toys on his mat and picked up a large wooden brick with a jolly blue elephant printed on it and hurled it clumsily at Rinpo. “Sometimes you presume too much, Sweeper <em class="calibre9">lookit 'lephant</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was some applause from the acolytes at the abbot's prowess in animal recognition. “He saw the patterns. He <em class="calibre9">knows </em>what is happening. He just doesn't know <em class="calibre9">what </em>he knows,” said Lu-Tze doggedly. “And within a few seconds of meeting me he stole a small object of value, and I'm still wondering how he did it. Can he really be as fast as that without training? Who is this boy?”</div>

        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Who <em class="calibre9">is </em>this girl?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout, headmistress of the Frout Academy and pioneer of the Frout Method of Learning Through Fun, often found herself thinking that when she had to interview Miss Susan. Of course, the girl was an employee, but… well, Madam Frout wasn't very good at discipline, which was possibly why she'd invented the Method, which didn't require any. She generally relied on talking to people in a jolly tone of voice until they gave in out of sheer embarrassment on her behalf.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan didn't appear ever to be embarrassed about <em class="calibre9">anything</em>. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The reason I've called you here, Susan, is that, er, the reason is—” Madam Frout faltered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There have been complaints?” said Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, no… er… although Miss Smith has told me that the children coming up from your class are, er, restless. Their reading ability is, she says, rather unfortunately advanced…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Miss Smith thinks a good book is about a boy and his dog chasing a big red ball,” said Miss Susan. “My children have learned to expect a plot. No wonder they get impatient. We're reading <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales </em>at the moment.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is rather rude of you, Susan.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, madam. That is rather polite of me. It would have been <em class="calibre9">rude </em>of me to say that there is a circle of Hell reserved for teachers like Miss Smith.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But that's a dreadf—” Madam Frout stopped, and began again. “You should not be teaching them to read at all yet!” she snapped. But it was the snap of a soggy twig. Madam Frout cringed back in her chair when Miss Susan looked up. The girl had this terrible ability to give you <em class="calibre9">her full attention</em>. You had to be a better person than Madam Frout to survive in the intensity of that attention. It inspected your soul, putting little red circles around the bits it didn't like. When Miss Susan looked at you, it was as if she was giving you <em class="calibre9">marks</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I mean,” the headmistress mumbled, “childhood is a time for play and—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Learning,” said Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Learning <em class="calibre9">through play</em>,” said Madam Frout, grateful to find familiar territory. “After all, kittens and puppies—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—grow up to be cats and dogs, which are even less interesting,” said Miss Susan, “whereas children should grow up to be adults.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout sighed. There was no way she was going to make any progress. It was always like this. She knew she was powerless. News about Miss Susan had got around. Worried parents who'd turned to Learning Through Play because they despaired of their offspring ever Learning By Paying Attention to What Anyone Said were finding them coming home a little quieter, a little more thoughtful and with a pile of homework which, amazingly, they did without prompting and even with the dog helping them. And they came home with stories about Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan spoke all languages. Miss Susan knew everything about everything. Miss Susan had wonderful ideas for school trips…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…and that was particularly puzzling, because as far as Madam Frout knew, none had been officially organized. There was invariably a busy silence from Miss Susan's classroom when she went past. This annoyed her. It harked back to the bad old days when children were Regimented in classrooms that were no better than Torture Chambers for Little Minds. But other teachers said that there <em class="calibre9">were </em>noises. Sometimes there was the faint sound of waves, or a jungle. Just once, Madam Frout could have sworn, if she was the sort to swear, that as she passed there was a full-scale battle going on. This had often been the case with Learning Through Play, but this time the addition of trumpets, the swish of arrows and the screams of the fallen seemed to be going <em class="calibre9">too </em>far.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd thrown open the door and felt something hiss through the air above her head. Miss Susan had been sitting on a stool, reading from a book, with the class cross-legged in a quiet and fascinated semicircle around her. It was the sort of old-fashioned image Madam Frout hated, as if the children were Supplicants around some sort of Altar of Knowledge.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No one had said anything. All the watching children, and Miss Susan, made it clear in polite silence that they were waiting for her to go away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd flounced back into the corridor and the door had clicked shut behind her. Then she noticed the long, crude arrow that was still vibrating in the opposite wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout had looked at the door, with its familiar green paint, and then back at the arrow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Which had gone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She transferred Jason to Miss Susan's class. It had been a cruel thing to do, but Madam Frout considered that there was now some kind of undeclared war going on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If children were weapons, Jason would have been banned by international treaty. Jason had doting parents and an attention span of minus several seconds, except when it came to inventive cruelty to small furry animals, when he could be quite patient. Jason kicked, punched, bit and spat. His artwork had even frightened the life out of Miss Smith, who could generally find something nice to say about any child. He was definitely a boy with special needs. In the view of the staffroom, these began with an exorcism.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout had stooped to listening at the keyhole. She had heard Jason's first tantrum of the day, and then silence. She couldn't quite make out what Miss Susan said next.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When she found an excuse to venture into the classroom half an hour later, Jason was helping two little girls to make a cardboard rabbit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Later his parents said they were amazed at the change, although apparently now he would only go to sleep with the light on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout tried to question her newest teacher. Glowing references were all very well, but she was an <em class="calibre9">employee</em>, after all. The trouble was, Susan had a way of saying things to her, Madam Frout had found, so that she went away feeling quite satisfied and only realized that she hadn't really had a proper answer at all when she was back in her office, by which time it was always too late.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And it continued to be too late because suddenly the school had a waiting list. Parents were fighting to get their children enrolled in Miss Susan's class. As for some of the stories they brought home… well, everyone knew children had such vivid imaginations, didn't they?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Even so, there was this essay by Richenda Higgs. Madam Frout fumbled for her glasses, which she was too vain to wear all the time and kept on a string around her neck, and looked at it again. In its entirety, it read: </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">A man with all bones came to talk to us he was not scarey at all, he had a big white hors. We pated the hors. He had a sighyve. He told us interesting things and to be careful when crosing the road</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout handed the paper across the desk to Miss Susan, who looked at it gravely. She pulled out a red pencil, made a few little alterations, then handed it back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?” said Madam Frout.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, she's not very good at punctuation, I'm afraid. A good attempt at ‘scythe’, though.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who… What's this about a big white horse in the classroom?” Madam Frout managed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan looked at her pityingly and said, “Madam, who could <em class="calibre9">possibly </em>bring a <em class="calibre9">horse </em>into a classroom? We're up two flights of stairs here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout was not going to be deterred this time. She held up another short essay. </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Today we were talked at by Mr Slumph who he is a bogeyman but he is nice now. He tole us what to do abot the other kind. You can put the blanket ove your head but it is bettr if you put it ove the bogeymans head then he think he do not exist and he is vanishs. He tole us lots of stores abot people he jump out on and he said sins Miss is our teachr he think no bogeymen will be in our houses bcos one thing a bogey dos not like is Miss finding him</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bogeymen, Susan?” said Madam Frout.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What imaginations children have,” said Miss Susan, with a straight face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you introducing young children to the occult?” said Madam Frout suspiciously. This sort of thing caused a lot of trouble with parents, she was well aware.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">What</em>? Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So that it doesn't come as a shock,” said Miss Susan calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But Mrs Robertson told me that her Emma was going round the house looking for monsters in the cupboards! And up until now she's always been afraid of them!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Did she have a stick?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“She had her father's sword!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good for her.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, Susan… I think I see what you're trying to do,” said Madam Frout, who didn't really, “but parents do not understand this sort of thing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Miss Susan. “Sometimes I really think people ought to have to pass a <em class="calibre9">proper </em>exam before they're allowed to be parents. Not just the practical, I mean.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless, we must respect their views,” said Madam Frout, but rather weakly because occasionally she'd thought the same thing. There had been the matter of Parents' Evening. Madam had been too tense to pay much attention to what her newest teacher was doing. All she'd been aware of was Miss Susan sitting and talking quietly to the couples, right up to the point where Jason's mother had picked up her chair and chased Jason's father out of the room. Next day a huge bunch of flowers had arrived for Susan from Jason's mother, and an even bigger bunch from Jason's father.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Quite a few other couples had also come away from Miss Susan's desk looking worried or harassed. Certainly Madam Frout, when the time came for next term's fees to be paid, had never known people cough up so readily.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there it was again. Madam Frout the headmistress, who had to worry about reputations and costs and fees, just occasionally heard the distant voice of Miss Frout who had been quite a good if rather shy teacher, and it was whistling and cheering Susan on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked concerned. “You are not satisfied with my work, madam?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout was stuck. No, she wasn't satisfied, but for all the wrong reasons. And it was dawning on her as this interview progressed that she didn't dare sack Miss Susan or, worse, let her leave of her own accord. If <em class="calibre9">she </em>set up a school and news got round, the Learning Through Play School would simply haemorrhage pupils and, importantly, fees.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, of course… no, not… in many ways…” she began, and became aware that Miss Susan was staring past her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was… Madam Frout groped for her glasses, and found their string had got tangled with the buttons of her blouse. She peered at the mantelpiece and tried to make sense of the blur.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why, it looks like a… a white rat, in a little black robe,” she said. “And walking on its hind legs, too! Can you see it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't imagine how a rat could wear a robe,” said Miss Susan. Then she sighed, and snapped her fingers. The finger-snapping wasn't essential, but time stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At least, it stopped for everyone but Miss Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And for the rat on the mantelpiece.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Which was in fact the <em class="calibre9">skeleton </em>of a rat, although this was not preventing it from trying to steal Madam Frout's jar of boiled sweets for Good Children.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan strode over and grasped the collar of the tiny robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK? said the Death of Rats.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">thought </em>it was you!” snapped Susan. “How dare you come here again! I thought you'd got the message the other day. <em class="calibre9">And </em>don't think I didn't see you when you turned up to collect Henry the Hamster last month! Do you know how hard it is to teach geography when you can see someone kicking the poo out of a treadmill?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rat sniggered: SNH. SNH. SNH.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you're eating a sweet! Put it in the bin right now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan dropped the rat onto the desk in front of the temporally frozen Madam Frout, and paused.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd always tried to be good about this sort of thing, but sometimes you just had to acknowledge who you were. So she pulled open the bottom drawer to check the level in the bottle that was Madam's shield and comforter in the wonderful world that was education, and was pleased to see that the old girl was going a bit easier on the stuff these days. Most people have some means of filling up the gap between perception and reality, and, after all, in those circumstances there are far worse things than gin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She also spent a little while going through Madam's private papers, and this has to be said about Susan: it did not occur to her that there was anything <em class="calibre9">wrong </em>about this, although she'd quite understand that it was probably wrong if you weren't Susan Sto Helit, of course. The papers were in quite a good safe that would have occupied a competent thief for at least twenty minutes. The fact that the door swung open at her touch suggested that special rules applied here.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No door was closed to Miss Susan. It ran in the family. Some genetics are passed on via the soul.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When she'd brought herself up to date on the school's affairs, mostly to indicate to the rat that she wasn't just someone who could be summoned at a moments notice, she stood up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All right,” she said wearily. “You're just going to pester me, aren't you? For ever and ever and ever.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats looked at her with its skull on one side.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK, it said winsomely.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, yes, I like him,” she said. “In a way. But, I mean, you know, it's not <em class="calibre9">right</em>. Why does he need <em class="calibre9">me</em>? He's Death! He's not exactly powerless! I'm just human!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rat squeaked again, jumped down onto the floor and ran through the closed door. It reappeared for a moment and beckoned to her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, all right,” said Susan to herself. “Make that <em class="calibre9">mostly </em>human.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">And who is this Lu-Tze?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Sooner or later every novice had to ask this rather complex question. Sometimes it would be years before they found out that the little man who swept their floors and uncomplainingly carted away the contents of the dormitory cesspit and occasionally came out with outlandish foreign sayings was the legendary hero they'd been told they would meet one day. And then, when they'd confronted him, the brightest of them confronted themselves.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mostly sweepers came from the villages in the valley. They were part of the staff of the monastery but they had no status. They did all the tedious, unregarded jobs. They were… figures in the background, pruning the cherry trees, washing the floors, cleaning out the carp pools and, always, sweeping. They had no names. That is, a thoughtful novice would understand that the sweepers <em class="calibre9">must </em>have names, some form by which they were known to other sweepers, but within the temple grounds at least they had no names, only instructions. No one knew where they went at night. They were just sweepers. But so was Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One day a group of senior novices, for mischief, kicked over the little shrine that Lu-Tze kept beside his sleeping mat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Next morning, no sweepers turned up for work. They stayed in their huts, with the doors barred. After making inquiries, the abbot, who at that time was fifty years old again, summoned the three novices to his room. There were three brooms leaning against the wall. He spoke as follows:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know that the dreadful Battle of Five Cities did not happen because the messenger got there in time?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They did. They learned this early in their studies. And they bowed nervously, because this was the abbot, after all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you know, then, that when the messenger's horse threw a shoe he espied a man trudging beside the road carrying a small portable forge and pushing an anvil on a barrow?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They knew.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you know that man was Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They did.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You surely know that Janda Trapp, Grand Master of <em class="calibre9">okidoki, toro-fu </em>and <em class="calibre9">chang-fu</em>, has only ever yielded to one man?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They knew.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you know that man is Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They did.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know the little shrine you kicked over last night?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They knew.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know it had an owner?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was silence. Then the brightest of the novices looked up at the abbot in horror, swallowed, picked up one of the three brooms and walked out of the room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other two were slower of brain and had to follow the story all the way through to the end.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then one of them said, “But it was only a sweeper's shrine!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You will take up the brooms and sweep,” said the abbot, “and you will sweep every day, and you will sweep until the day you find Lu-Tze and dare to say ‘Sweeper, it was I who knocked over and scattered your shrine and now I will in humility accompany you to the dojo of the Tenth Djim, in order to learn the Right Way.’ Only then, if you are still able, may you resume your studies here. Understood?”<a href="#TOT_APF6" title="6. And the story continues: The novice who had protested that it was only the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple, the student who said nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life; and the student who had seen the inevitable shape of the story went, after much agonizing and several months of meticulous sweeping, to Lu-Tze and knelt and asked to be shown the Right Way. Whereupon the Sweeper took him to the dojo of the Tenth Djim, with its terrible multi-bladed fighting machines and its fearsome serrated weapons such as the clong-clong and the uppsi. The story runs that the Sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo and produced a broom and spake thusly: “One hand here and the other here, understand? People never get it right. Use good, even strokes and let the broom do most of the work. Never try to sweep up a big pile, you'll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice. Use your dustpan wisely, and remember: a small brush for the corners.”"><sup class="calibre10">6</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Older monks sometimes complained, but someone would always say, “Remember that Lu-Tze's Way is not our Way. Remember he learned everything by sweeping unheeded while students were being educated. Remember, he has been everywhere and done many things. Perhaps he is a little… strange, but remember that he walked into a citadel full of armed men and traps and nevertheless saw to it that the Pash of Muntab choked innocently on a fish bone. No monk is better than Lu-Tze at finding the Time and the Place.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some, who did not know, might say: “What is this Way that gives him so much power?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And they would be told: “It is the Way of Mrs Marietta Cosmopilite, 3 Quirm Street, Ankh-Morpork, Rooms For Rent, Very Reasonable. No, we don't understand it, either. Some subsendential rubbish, apparently.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze listened to the senior monks, while leaning on his broom. Listening was an art he had developed over the years, having learned that if you listened hard and long enough people would tell you more than they thought they knew.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Soto is a good field operative,” he said at last. “Weird but good.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The fall even showed up on the Mandala,” said Rinpo. “The boy <em class="calibre9">knew </em>none of the appropriate actions. Soto said he'd done it reflexively. He said he thought the boy was as close to null as he has ever witnessed. He had him put on a cart for the mountains within the hour. He then spent three whole days performing the Closing of the Flower at the Guild of Thieves, where the boy had apparently been left as a baby.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The closure was successful?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We authorized the run time of two Procrastinators. Perhaps a few people will have faint memories, but the Guild is a large and busy place.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No brothers, no sisters. No love of parents. Just the brotherhood of thieves,” said Lu-Tze sadly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He was, however, a <em class="calibre9">good </em>thief.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll bet. How old is he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sixteen or seventeen, it appears.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Too old to teach, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The senior monks exchanged glances.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We cannot teach him anything,” said the Master of Novices. “He—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze held up a skinny hand. “Let me guess. He knows it already?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's as though he's being told something that had momentarily slipped his memory,” said Rinpo. “And then he gets bored and angry. He's not all there, in my opinion.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze scratched in his stained beard. “Mystery boy,” he said thoughtfully. “Naturally talented.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And we ask ourselves <em class="calibre9">wanna potty wanna potty poo </em>why now, why at this time?” said the abbot, chewing the foot of a toy yak.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, but is it not said, ‘There is a Time and a Place for Everything’?” said Lu-Tze. “Anyway, reverend sirs, you have taught pupils for hundreds of years. I am but a sweeper.” Absentmindedly, he stuck out his hand just as the yak left the fumbling fingers of the abbot, and caught it in mid-air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze,” said the Master of Novices, “to be brief, we were unable to teach you. Remember?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But then I found my Way,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Will you teach him?” said the abbot. “The boy needs to <em class="calibre9">mmm brmmm </em>find himself.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it not written, ‘I have only one pair of hands’?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rinpo looked at the Master of Novices. “I don't know,” he said. “None of us ever sees this stuff you quote.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Still looking thoughtful, as if his mind were busy elsewhere, Lu-Tze said, “It could only be here and now. For it is written: ‘It never rains but it pours.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rinpo looked puzzled, and then enlightenment dawned. “A jug,” he said, looking pleased. “A jug never rains, but it pours!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze shook his head sadly. “And the sound of one hand clapping is a ‘cl’,” he said. “Very well, Your Reverence. I will help him to find a Way. Will there be anything else, reverend sirs?”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stood up when Lu-Tze returned to the anteroom, but he did it hesitantly, embarrassed at appearing to show respect.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Okay, here are the rules,” said Lu-Tze, walking straight past. “Word one is, you don't call me ‘master’ and I don't name you after some damn insect. It's not my job to discipline you, it's yours. For it is written, ‘I can't be having with that kind of thing.’ Do what I tell you and we'll get along fine. All right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? You want me as an <em class="calibre9">apprentice</em>?” said Lobsang, running to keep up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, I don't want you as an apprentice, not at my age, but you're going to be so we'd both better make the best of it, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you will teach me <em class="calibre9">everything</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know about ‘everything’. I mean, I don't know much forensic mineralogy. But I will teach you all that I know that is useful for you to know, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“When?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's getting late—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“At dawn tomorrow?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, before dawn. I'll wake you.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Some distance away from Madam Frout's Academy, in Esoteric Street, were a number of gentlemen's clubs. It would be far too cynical to say that here the term “gentleman” was simply defined as “someone who can afford five hundred dollars a year”; they <em class="calibre9">also </em>had to be approved of by a great many other gentlemen who could afford the same fee.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And they didn't much like the company of ladies. This was not to say that they were <em class="calibre9">that </em>kind of gentlemen, who had their own, rather better-decorated clubs in another part of town, where there was generally a lot more going on. <em class="calibre9">These </em>gentlemen were gentlemen of a class who were, on the whole, bullied by ladies from an early age. Their lives were steered by nurses, governesses, matrons, mothers and wives, and after four or five decades of that the average mild-mannered gentleman gave up and escaped as politely as possible to one of these clubs, where he could snooze the afternoon away in a leather armchair with the top button of his trousers undone.<a href="#TOT_APF7" title="7. One reason for this was the club food. At his club, a gentleman could find the kind of food he'd got used to at school, like spotted dick, jam roly-poly and that perennial favourite, stodge and custard. Vitamins are eaten by wives."><sup class="calibre10">7</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">The most select of these clubs was Fidgett's, and it operated like this: Susan didn't need to make herself invisible, because she knew that the members of Fidgett's would simply not see her, or believe that she really existed even if they did. Women weren't allowed in the club at all except under Rule 34b, which grudgingly allowed for female members of the family or respectable married ladies over thirty to be entertained to tea in the Green Drawing Room between 3.15 and 4.30p.m., provided at least one member of staff was present at all times. This had been the case for so long that many members now interpreted it as being the only seventy-five minutes in the day when women were actually allowed to exist and, therefore, any women seen in the club at any other time were a figment of their imagination.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the case of Susan, in her rather strict black schoolteaching outfit and button boots that somehow appeared to have higher heels when she was being Death's granddaughter, this might well have been true.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The boots echoed on the marble floor as she made her way to the library.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a mystery to her why Death had started using the place. Of course, he did have many of the qualities of a gentleman: he had a place in the country—a far, dark country—was unfailingly punctual, was courteous to all those he met—and sooner or later he met <em class="calibre9">everyone </em>–was well if soberly dressed, at home in any company and, proverbially, a good horseman.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The fact that he was the Grim Reaper was the only bit that didn't quite fit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Most of the overstuffed chairs in the library were occupied by contented lunchers dozing happily under tented copies of the <em class="calibre9">Ankh-Morpork Times</em>. Susan looked around until she found the copy from which projected the bottom half of a black robe and two bony feet. There was also a scythe leaning against the back of the armchair. She raised the paper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">GOOD AFTERNOON, said Death. HAVE YOU HAD LUNCH? IT WAS JAM ROLY-POLY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why do you do this, Grandfather? You know you don't sleep.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I FIND IT RESTFUL. ARE YOU WELL?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I was until the rat arrived.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOUR CAREER PROGRESSES? YOU KNOW I CARE FOR YOU.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” said Susan shortly. “Now, why did—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WOULD A LITTLE SMALL TALK HURT?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed. She knew what was behind that, and it wasn't a happy thought. It was a small, sad and wobbly little thought, and it ran: each of them had no one else but the other. There. It was a thought that sobbed into its own handkerchief, but it was true.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Oh, Death had his manservant, Albert, and of course there was the Death of Rats, if you could call that company.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And as far as Susan was concerned…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Well, she was partly immortal, and that was all there was to it. She could see things that were really there,<a href="#TOT_APF8" title="8. Which is much harder than seeing things that aren't there. Everyone does that."><sup class="calibre10">8</sup></a> she could put time on and off like an overcoat. Rules that applied to everyone else, like gravity, applied to her only when she let them. And, however hard you tried, this sort of thing did tend to get in the way of relationships. It was hard to deal with people when a tiny part of you saw them as a temporary collection of atoms that would not be around in another few decades.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there she met the tiny part of Death that found it hard to deal with people when it thought of them as real.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Not a day went past but she regretted her curious ancestry. And then she'd wonder what it could possibly be like to walk the world unaware at every step of the rocks beneath your feet and the stars overhead, to have a mere five senses, to be almost blind and nearly deaf…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE CHILDREN ARE WELL? I LIKED THEIR PAINTINGS OF ME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. How is Albert?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">HE IS WELL.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…and not really <em class="calibre9">have </em>any small talk, Susan added to herself. There wasn't room for small talk in a big universe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Well, that was <em class="calibre9">big </em>talk. “When?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NEXT WEDNESDAY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE AUDITORS ARE BACK, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Those evil little things?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I hate them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I, OF COURSE, DO NOT HAVE ANY EMOTIONS, said Death, poker-faced as only a skull can be.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are they up to this time?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I CANNOT SAY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought you could remember the future!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. BUT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. AFTER WEDNESDAY, THERE IS NO FUTURE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There must be something, even if it's only debris!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NO. AFTER ONE O'CLOCK NEXT WEDNESDAY THERE IS NOTHING. JUST ONE O'CLOCK NEXT WEDNESDAY, FOR EVER AND EVER. NO ONE WILL LIVE. NO ONE WILL DIE. THAT IS WHAT I NOW SEE. THE FUTURE HAS CHANGED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And what has this got to do with me?” Susan knew this would sound stupid to anyone else.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE END OF THE WORLD IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY, WOULDN'T YOU?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">You </em>know what I mean!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I BELIEVE THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE NATURE OF TIME, WHICH IS BOTH IMMORTAL AND HUMAN. THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN… RIPPLES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're going to do something to Time? I thought they weren't allowed to do things like that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NO. BUT HUMANS CAN. IT HAS BEEN DONE ONCE BEFORE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No one would be that stu—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan stopped. Of course someone would be that stupid. Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying “End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH”, the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She thought some more. Death was watching her intently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she said, “Funnily enough, there is this book I've been reading to the class. I found it on my desk one day. It's called <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales</em>…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH, HAPPY TALES FOR LITTLE FOLK, said Death, without a trace of irony.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…which is mostly about wicked people dying in horrible ways. It's strange, really. The children seem quite happy with the idea. It doesn't seem to worry them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death said nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…except in the case of the Glass Clock of Bad Schuschein,” said Susan, watching his skull. “They found that quite upsetting, even though it's got a kind of happy ending.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE STORY IS TRUE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan had known Death long enough not to argue.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think I understand,” she said. “You made sure the book was there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. OH, THE RUBBISH ABOUT THE HANDSOME PRINCE AND SO ON IS AN OBVIOUS ADDITION. THE AUDITORS DID NOT INVENT THE CLOCK, OF COURSE. THAT WAS THE WORK OF A MADMAN. BUT THEY ARE GOOD AT ADAPTING. THEY CANNOT CREATE, BUT THEY CAN ADAPT. AND THE CLOCK IS BEING REBUILT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Was time really stopped?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TRAPPED. ONLY FOR A MOMENT, BUT THE RESULTS STILL LIE ALL AROUND US. HISTORY WAS SHATTERED, FRAGMENTED. PASTS WERE NO LONGER LINKED TO FUTURES. THE HISTORY MONKS HAD TO REBUILD IT PRACTICALLY FROM SCRATCH.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan did not waste breath saying things like, “That's impossible,” at a time like this. Only people who believed that they lived in the real world said things like that.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That must have taken some… time,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TIME, OF COURSE, WAS NOT THE ISSUE. THEY USE A FORM OF YEARS BASED ON THE HUMAN PULSE RATE. OF THOSE YEARS, IT TOOK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But if history was shattered, where did they get—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death steepled his fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THINK TEMPORALLY, SUSAN. I BELIEVE THEY STOLE SOME TIME FROM SOME EARLIER AGE OF THE WORLD, WHERE IT WAS BEING WASTED ON A LOT OF REPTILES. WHAT IS TIME TO A BIG LIZARD, AFTER ALL? HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE PROCRASTINATORS THE MONKS USE? WONDERFUL THINGS. THEY CAN MOVE TIME, STORE IT, STRETCH IT… QUITE INGENIOUS. AS FOR <em class="calibre9">WHEN </em>THIS HAPPENED, THE QUESTION ALSO MAKES NO SENSE. WHEN THE BOTTLE IS BROKEN, DOES IT MATTER WHERE THE GLASS WAS HIT? THE SHARDS OF THE EVENT ITSELF NO LONGER EXIST IN THIS REBUILT HISTORY, IN ANY CASE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hold on, hold on… How can you take a piece of, oh, some old century, and <em class="calibre9">stitch </em>it into a modern one? Wouldn't people notice that…” Susan flailed a bit, “oh, that people have got the wrong armour and the buildings are all wrong and they're still in the middle of wars that happened centuries ago?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IN MY EXPERIENCE, SUSAN, WITHIN THEIR HEADS TOO MANY HUMANS SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF WARS THAT HAPPENED CENTURIES AGO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very insightful, but what I <em class="calibre9">meant </em>was—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU MUST NOT CONFUSE THE CONTENT WITH THE CONTAINER. Death sighed. YOU ARE MOSTLY HUMAN. YOU NEED A METAPHOR. AN OBJECT LESSON IS CLEARLY IN ORDER. COME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stood up and stalked into the dining room across the hall. There were still a few late lunchers frozen in their work, napkins tucked under their chins, in an atmosphere of happy carbohydrates.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death walked up to a table that had been laid for dinner, and gripped a corner of the tablecloth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TIME IS THE CLOTH, he said. THE CUTLERY AND PLATES ARE THE EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE WITHIN TIME—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a drum roll. Susan glanced down. The Death of Rats was seated in front of a tiny drum kit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">OBSERVE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death pulled the cloth away. There was a rattle of cutlery and a moment of uncertainty regarding a vase of flowers, but almost all the tableware remained in place.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE TABLE REMAINS LAID, BUT THE CLOTH CAN NOW BE USED FOR ANOTHER MEAL.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“However, you knocked the salt over,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE TECHNIQUE IS NOT PERFECT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And there are stains on the cloth from the previous meal, Grandfather.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death beamed. YES, he said. AS METAPHORS GO IT IS RATHER GOOD, DON'T YOU THINK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“People would notice!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">REALLY? HUMANS ARE THE MOST UNOBSERVANT CREATURES IN THE UNIVERSE. OH, THERE ARE LOTS OF ANOMALIES, OF COURSE, A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPILLED SALT, BUT HISTORIANS EXPLAIN THEM AWAY. THEY ARE SO VERY USEFUL IN THAT RESPECT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was something called the Rules, Susan knew. They weren't written down, in the same way that mountains weren't written down. They were far more fundamental to the operation of the universe than mere mechanical things like gravity. The Auditors might hate the untidiness caused by the emergence of life, but the Rules did not allow them to do anything about it. The ascent of mankind must have been a boon to them. At last there was a species that could be <em class="calibre9">persuaded </em>to shoot itself in the foot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know what you expect me to do about it,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN, said Death. I, BY CUSTOM AND PRACTICE, HAVE OTHER DUTIES AT THIS TIME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Such as?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IMPORTANT MATTERS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That you can't tell me about?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO TELL YOU ABOUT. BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT. IN ANY CASE, YOUR INSIGHT IS VALUABLE. YOU HAVE WAYS OF THINKING THAT WILL BE USEFUL. YOU CAN GO WHERE I CANNOT. I HAVE ONLY <em class="calibre9">SEEN </em>THE FUTURE. BUT YOU CAN CHANGE IT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where <em class="calibre9">is </em>this clock being rebuilt?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I CANNOT TELL. I HAVE DONE WELL TO DEDUCE WHAT I HAVE. THE ISSUE IS CLOUDED FROM ME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BEEN HIDDEN. SOMEONE IS INVOLVED… WHO IS NOT SUBJECT TO ME. Death looked awkward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An immortal?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SOMEONE SUBJECT TO… SOMEONE ELSE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to have to be a lot clearer than that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SUSAN… YOU KNOW THAT I ADOPTED AND RAISED YOUR MOTHER, AND FOUND A SUITABLE HUSBAND FOR HER</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, yes,” snapped Susan. “How could I forget? I look in my mirror every day.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THIS IS… DIFFICULT FOR ME. THE TRUTH IS, I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO INVOLVE MYSELF LIKE THAT. WHY LOOK SURPRISED? IS IT NOT WELL KNOWN THAT GODS DO THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE TIME?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Gods, yes, but people like you—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">PEOPLE LIKE US ARE STILL LIKE PEOPLE…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan did an unusual thing, and listened. That's not an easy task for a teacher.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SUSAN, YOU WILL KNOW THAT WE WHO ARE… OUTSIDE HUMANITY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not outside humanity,” said Susan sharply. “I just have a few… extra talents.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I DID NOT MEAN YOU, OF COURSE. I MEANT THE OTHERS WHO ARE NOT HUMAN AND YET PART OF HUMANITY'S UNIVERSE—WAR AND DESTINY AND PESTILENCE AND THE REST OF US—WE ARE ENVISAGED AS HUMAN BY HUMANS AND THUS, IN VARIOUS FASHIONS, WE TAKE ON SOME ASPECTS OF HUMANITY. IT CAN BE NO OTHER WAY. EVEN THE VERY BODY SHAPE FORCES UPON OUR MINDS A CERTAIN WAY OF OBSERVING THE UNIVERSE. WE PICK UP HUMAN TRAITS… CURIOSITY, ANGER, RESTLESSNESS…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is basic stuff, Grandfather.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. AND YOU KNOW, THEREFORE, THAT SOME OF US… TAKE AN INTEREST IN HUMANITY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">know</em>. I am one of the <em class="calibre9">results</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. ER… AND SOME OF US TAKE AN INTEREST WHICH IS, ER, MORE…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Interesting?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…PERSONAL. AND YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK OF THE… PERSONIFICATION OF TIME…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You didn't tell me much. She lives in a palace of glass, you once said.” Susan felt a small, shameful and yet curiously satisfying sensation in seeing Death discomfited. He looked like someone who was being forced to reveal a skeleton in the closet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. ER… SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH A HUMAN…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How very <em class="calibre9">romantick</em>,” said Susan, inserting the k. Now she was being childishly perverse, she knew, but life as Death's granddaughter was not easy, and just occasionally she had the irresistible urge to annoy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH. A PUN, OR PLAY ON WORDS, said Death wearily, ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT YOU WERE MERELY TRYING TO BE TIRESOME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, that sort of thing used to happen a lot in antiquity, didn't it?” said Susan. “Poets were always falling in love with moonlight or hyacinths or something, and goddesses were forever—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BUT THIS WAS REAL, said Death. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How real do you mean?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TIME HAD A SON.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How could—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TIME HAD A SON. SOMEONE MOSTLY MORTAL. SOMEONE LIKE YOU.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">A member of the Clockmakers' Guild called on Jeremy once a week. It was nothing formal. In any case there was often some work for him to do, or some results to be collected, because whatever else you might say about him, the boy had a genius for clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Informally, the visit was also a delicate way to make sure that the lad was taking his medicine and wasn't noticeably crazy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clockmakers were well aware that the intricate mechanisms of the human brain could occasionally throw a screw. The Guild's members tended to be meticulous people, always in pursuit of an inhuman accuracy, and this took its toll. It could cause problems. Springs were not the only things that got wound up. The Guild committee were, by and large, kind and understanding men. They were not, on the whole, men accustomed to guile.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Dr Hopkins, the Guild's secretary, was surprised when the door of Jeremy's shop was opened by a man who appeared to have survived a very serious accident.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, I'm here to see Mr Jeremy,” he managed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thir. The marthter ith in, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you, mm, are…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Igor, thur. Mr Jeremy wath kind enough to take me on, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You work for him?” said Dr Hopkins, looking Igor up and down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mm… Have you been standing too close to some dangerous machinery?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">No</em>, thur. He ith in the workthop, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr Igor,” said Dr Hopkins, as he was ushered into the shop, “you do know that Mr Jeremy has to take medicine, don't you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur. He mentionth it often.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And he, mm, his general health is…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good, thur. He ith enthuthiathtic for hith work, thur. Bright-eyed and buthy-tailed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Buthy-tailed, eh?” said Dr Hopkins weakly. “Mm… Mr Jeremy doesn't usually keep servants. I'm afraid he threw a clock at the head of the last assistant he had.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really, thur?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mm, he hasn't thrown a clock at your head, has he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thur. He actth quite normally,” said Igor, a man with four thumbs and stitches all around his neck. He opened the door into the workshop. “Dr Hopkinth, Mr Jeremy. I will make thome tea, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy was sitting bolt upright at the table, his eyes gleaming.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, doctor,” he said. “How kind of you to come.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Dr Hopkins took in the workshop.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There had been changes. Quite a large piece of lath-and-plaster wall, covered in pencilled sketches, had been removed from somewhere and stood on an easel on one side of the room. The benches, usually the resting places of clocks in various stages of assembly, were covered with lumps of crystal and slabs of glass. And there was a strong smell of acid.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mm… something new?” Dr Hopkins ventured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, doctor. I've been examining the properties of certain superdense crystals,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Dr Hopkins took a deep breath of relief. “Ah, geology. A wonderful hobby! I'm so glad. It's not good to think about clocks <em class="calibre9">all </em>the time, you know!” he added, jovially, and with a soupcon of hope.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy's brow wrinkled, as if the brain behind it was trying to fit around an unfamiliar concept.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” he said at last. “Did you know, doctor, that copper octirate vibrates exactly two million, four hundred thousand and seventy-eight times a second?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“As much as that, eh?” said Dr Hopkins. “My word.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed. And light shone through a natural prism of octivium quartz splits into only three colours?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fascinating,” said Dr Hopkins, reflecting that it could be worse. “Mm… is it me, or is there a rather… <em class="calibre9">sharp </em>smell in the air?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Drains,” said Jeremy. “We've been cleaning them. With acid. Which is what we needed the acid for. For cleaning the drains.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Drains, eh?” Dr Hopkins blinked. He wasn't at home in the world of drains. There was a crackling sound and blue light flickered under the door of the kitchen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Your, mm, man Igor,” he said. “All right, is he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, thank you, doctor. He's from Uberwald, you know.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. Very… big, Uberwald. Very big country.” That was one of only two things Dr Hopkins knew about Uberwald. He coughed nervously, and mentioned the other one. “People there can be a bit strange, I've heard.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Igor says he's never had anything to do with that kind of person,” said Jeremy calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. Good. That <em class="calibre9">is </em>good,” said the doctor. Jeremy's fixed smile was beginning to unnerve him. “He, mm, seems to have a lot of scars and stitches.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. It's cultural.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Cultural, is it?” Dr Hopkins looked relieved. He was a man who tried to see the best in everybody, but the city had got rather complicated since he was a boy, with dwarfs and trolls and golems and even zombies. He wasn't sure he liked everything that was happening, but a lot of it was “cultural”, apparently, and you couldn't object to that, so he didn't. “Cultural” sort of solved problems by explaining that they weren't really there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The light under the door went out. A moment later Igor came in with two cups of tea on a tray.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was good tea, the doctor had to admit, but the acid in the air was making his eyes water.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So, mm, how is the work on the new navigation tables going?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ginger bithcuit, thur?” said Igor, by his ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, er, yes… Oh, I say, these are rather good, Mr Igor.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Take two, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you.” Now Dr Hopkins sprayed crumbs as he spoke. “The navigation tables—” he repeated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am afraid I have not been able to make very much progress,” said Jeremy. “I have been engaged on the properties of crystals.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. Yes. You said. Well, of course we are very grateful for any time that you feel you can spare,” said Dr Hopkins. “And if I may say so, mm, it is good to see you with a new interest. Too much concentration on one thing is, mm, conducive to ill humours of the brain.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have medicine,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course. Er, as a matter of fact, since I happened to be going past the apothecary today…” Dr Hopkins pulled a large, paper-wrapped bottle out of his pocket.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you.” Jeremy indicated the shelf behind him. “As you can see, I have nearly run out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I thought you might,” said Dr Hopkins, as if the level of the bottle on Jeremy's shelf wasn't something the clockmakers kept a very careful eye on. “Well, I shall be going, then. Well done with the crystals. I used to collect butterflies when I was a boy. Wonderful things, hobbies. Give me a killing jar and a net and I was as happy as a little lark.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy still smiled at him. There was something glassy about the smile.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Dr Hopkins swallowed the remainder of his tea and put the cup back in the saucer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now I really must be on my way,” he mumbled. “So much to do. Don't wish to keep you from your work. Crystals, eh? Wonderful things. So pretty.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are they?” said Jeremy. He hesitated, as though he was trying to solve a minor problem. “Oh, yes. Patterns of light.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Twinkly,” said Dr Hopkins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor was waiting by the street door when Dr Hopkins reached it. He nodded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mm… you are sure about the medicine?” the doctor said quietly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh yeth, thur. Twithe a day I watch him pour out a thpoonful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, good. He can be a little, er… sometimes he doesn't get on well with people.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very, um, very <em class="calibre9">particular </em>about accuracy…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…which is a good thing, of course. Wonderful thing, accuracy,” said Dr Hopkins, and sniffed. “Up to a point, of course. Well, good day to you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good day, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When Igor returned to the workshop Jeremy was carefully pouring the blue medicine into a spoon. When the spoon was exactly full, he tipped it into the sink. “They check, you know,” he said. “They think I don't notice.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm thure they mean well, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm afraid I can't think so well when I take the medicine,” he said. “In fact I think I'm getting on a lot better without it, don't you? It slows me down.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor took refuge in silence. In his experience, many of the world's greatest discoveries were made by men who would be considered mad by conventional standards. Insanity depended on your point of view, he always said, and if it was the view through your own underpants then everything looked fine.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But young Master Jeremy was beginning to worry him. He never laughed, and Igor liked a good maniacal laugh. You could trust it. Since giving up the medicine, Jeremy had not, as Igor had expected, begun to gibber and shout things like “Mad! They said I was mad! But I shall show them all! Ahahahaha!” He'd simply become more—focused.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then there was that smile. Igor was not easily frightened, because otherwise he wouldnl be able to look in a mirror, but he <em class="calibre9">was </em>becoming a little troubled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now, where were we…?” said Jeremy. “Oh, yes, give me a hand here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Together they moved the table aside. Under it, dozens of glass jars hissed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not enough power,” said Igor. “Altho, we have not got the mirrorth right yet, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy pulled the cloth off the device on the workbench. Glass and crystal glittered, and in some cases glittered very strangely. As Jeremy had remarked yesterday, in the clarity that was returning now that he was carefully pouring one spoonful of his medicine down the sink twice a day, some of the angles looked wrong. One crystal had disappeared when he'd locked it into place, but it was clearly still there because he could see the light reflecting off it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And we've thtill got too much metal in it, thur,” Igor grumbled. “It wath the thpring that did for the latht one.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll find a way,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Home-made lightning ith never ath good ath the real thort,” said Igor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good enough to test the principle,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Tetht the printhiple, tetht the printhiple,” muttered Igor. “Thorry, thur, but Igorth do not ‘tetht the printhiple’. Thtrap it to the bench and put a good thick bolt of lightning through it, thatth our motto. Thatth how you <em class="calibre9">tetht </em>thomething.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You seem ill at ease, Igor.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, I'm thorry, thur,” said Igor. “It'th the climate dithagreeing with me. I'm uthed to regular thunderthtormth.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've heard that some people really seem to come alive in thunderstorms,” said Jeremy, carefully adjusting the angle of a crystal.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, that wath when I worked for Baron Finklethtein,” said Igor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy stood back. This wasn't the clock, of course. There was still a lot more work to do (but he could see it in front of him, if he closed his eyes) before they had a clock. This was just an essay, to see if he was on the right lines.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He <em class="calibre9">was </em>on the right lines. He knew it.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Susan walked back through the motionless streets, sat down in Madam Frout's office and let herself sink back into the stream of time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She had never found out how this worked. It just did. Time didn't stop for the rest of the world, and it didn't stop for her—it was just that she entered a kind of loop of time, and everything else stayed exactly as it was until she'd finished what she needed to do.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was another inherited family trait. It worked best if you didn't think about it, just like tightrope walking. Anyway, now she had <em class="calibre9">other </em>things to think about.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout turned her gaze back from the rat-free mantelpiece. “Oh,” she said. “It seems to have gone.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was probably a trick of the light, madam,” said Susan. <em class="calibre9">Mostly human</em>. Someone like me, she thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, er, of course…” Madam Frout managed to get her glasses on, despite the fact that the string was still tangled with the button. It meant that she'd moored herself to her own chest, but she was damned if she was going to do anything about it now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan could unnerve a glacier. All she had to do was sit quietly, looking polite and alert.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What precisely was it you wanted, madam?” she said. “It's just that I've left the class doing algebra, and they get restless when they've finished.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Algebra?” said Madam Frout, perforce staring at her own bosom, which no one else had ever done. “But that's far too difficult for seven-year-olds!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but I didn't tell them that and so far they haven't found out,” said Susan. It was time to move things along. “I expect you wanted to see me about my letter, madam?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout looked blank. “Wh—” she began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed and snapped her fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She walked round and opened a drawer by the motionless Madam Frout, removed a sheet of paper and spent some time carefully writing a letter. She let the ink dry, rustled the paper a bit to make it look slightly second-hand, and then put it just under the top of the pile of paperwork beside Madam Frout, with enough of it peeking out so that it would be easy to see.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She returned to her seat. She snapped her fingers again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—at letter?” said Madam Frout. And then she looked down at her desk. “Oh.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a cruel thing to do, Susan knew. But while Madam Frout was not by any means a bad person and was quite kind to children, in a haphazard way, she was silly. And Susan did not have a lot of time for silly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I asked if I might have a few days' leave,” said Susan. “Pressing family matters, I'm afraid. I have prepared some work for the children to get on with, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Madam Frout hesitated. Susan didn't have time for this, either. She snapped her fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“MY GOODNESS, THAT'D BE A RELIEF,” she said, in a voice whose harmonics went all the way into the subconscious. “IF WE DON'T SLOW HER DOWN WE'LL RUN OUT OF THINGS TO TEACH THEM! SHE HAS BEEN PERFORMING SMALL MIRACLES ON A DAILY BASIS AND DESERVES A RAISE.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she sat back, snapped her fingers again, and <em class="calibre9">watched </em>the words settle into the forefront of Madam Frours mind. The woman's lips actually moved.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why, yes, of course,” she murmured at last. “You have been working very hard… and… and,” and since there are things even a voice of eldritch command can't achieve and one of them is to get extra money out of a head teacher, “we shall have to think about a little increment for you one of these days.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan returned to the classroom and spent the rest of the day performing small miracles, which included removing the glue from Richenda's hair, emptying the wee out of Billy's shoes and treating the class to a short visit to the continent of Fourecks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When their parents came to pick them up they were all waving crayoned pictures of kangaroos, and Susan had to hope that the red dust on their shoes—red mud in the case of Billy's, whose sense of timing had not improved—would pass unnoticed. It probably would. Fidgett's was not the only place where adults didn't see what couldn't possibly be true.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Now she sat back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was something pleasant about an empty classroom. Of course, as any teacher would point out, one nice thing was that there were no children in it, and particularly no Jason.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the tables and shelves around the room showed evidence of a term well spent. Paintings lined the walls, and displayed good use of perspective and colour. The class had built a full-size white horse out of cardboard boxes, during which time they'd learned a lot about horses and Susan learned about Jason's remarkably accurate powers of observation. She'd had to take the cardboard tube away from him and explain that this was a <em class="calibre9">polite </em>horse.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had been a long day. She raised the lid of her desk and took out <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales</em>. This dislodged some paperwork, which in turn revealed a small cardboard box decorated in black and gold.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had been a little present from Vincent's parents.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stared at the box.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Every day she had to go through this. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even as if Higgs &amp; Meakins did <em class="calibre9">good </em>chocolates. They were just butter and sugar and—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She scrabbled amongst the sad little scraps of brown paper inside the box and pulled out a chocolate. No one could be expected not to have just <em class="calibre9">one </em>chocolate, after all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She put it in her mouth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Damn<em class="calibre9">damn</em>damn<em class="calibre9">damn</em>! It was <em class="calibre9">nougat </em>inside! Her one chocolate today and it was damn artificial damn pink-and-white damn sickly damn stupid <em class="calibre9">nougat!</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Well, no one could be expected to believe <em class="calibre9">that </em>counted.<a href="#TOT_APF9" title="9. This is true. A chocolate you did not want to eat does not count as chocolate. This discovery is from the same branch of culinary physics that determined that food eaten while walking contains no calories."><sup class="calibre10">9</sup></a> She was entitled to another—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The teacher part of her, which had eyes in the back of its head, caught the blur of movement. She spun round.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No running with scythes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats stopped jogging along the Nature Table and gave her a guilty look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And no going into the Stationery Cupboard, either,” said Susan, automatically. She slammed the desk lid shut.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, you were. I could hear you <em class="calibre9">thinking </em>about it.” It was possible to deal with the Death of Rats provided you thought of him as a very small Jason.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Stationery Cupboard! That was one of the great battlegrounds of classroom history, that and the playhouse. But the ownership of the playhouse usually sorted itself out without Susan's intervention, so that all she had to do was be ready with ointment, a nose-blow and mild sympathy for the losers, whereas the Stationery Cupboard was a war of attrition. It contained pots of powder paint and reams of paper and boxes of crayons and more idiosyncratic items like a spare pair of pants for Billy, who did his best. It also contained The Scissors, which under classroom rules were treated as some kind of Doomsday Machine, and, of course, the boxes of stars. The only people allowed in the cupboard were Susan and, usually, Vincent. Despite everything Susan had tried, short of actual deception, he was always the official “best at everything” and won the coveted honour every day, which was to go into the Stationery Cupboard and fetch the pencils and hand them out. For the rest of the class, and especially Jason, the Stationery Cupboard was some mystic magic realm to be entered whenever possible.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Honestly, thought Susan, once you learn the arts of defending the Stationery Cupboard, outwitting Jason and keeping the class pet alive until the end of term, you've mastered at least half of teaching.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She signed the register, watered the sad plants on the windowsill, went and fetched some fresh privet from the hedge for the stick insects that were the successor to Henry the Hamster (chosen on the basis that it was quite hard to tell when they were dead), tidied a few errant crayons away and looked around the classroom at all those little chairs. It sometimes worried her that nearly everyone she knew well was three feet high.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She was never certain that she trusted her grandfather at times like this. It was all to do with the Rules. He couldn't interfere, but he knew her weaknesses and he could wind her up and send her out into the world…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Someone like me</em>. Yes, he'd known how to engage her interest.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Someone like me</em>. Suddenly there's some dangerous clock somewhere in the world, and suddenly I'm told that there's <em class="calibre9">someone like me</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Someone like me</em>. Except not like me. At least I knew my parents. And she'd listened to Death's account of the tall dark woman wandering from room to room in the endless castle of glass, weeping for the child she'd given birth to and could see every day but could never touch…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Where do I even <em class="calibre9">begin?</em></div>

      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang learned a lot. He learned that every room has at least four corners. He learned that the sweepers started work when the sky was light enough to see the dust, and continued until sunset.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As a master, Lu-Tze was kind enough. He would always point out those bits that Lobsang had not done properly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After the initial anger, and the taunting of his former classmates, Lobsang found that the work had a certain charm. Days drifted past under his broom…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…until, almost with an audible click in his brain, he decided that enough was enough. He finished his section of passageway, and found Lu-Tze dreamily pushing his brush along a terrace. “Sweeper?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is it you are trying to tell me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't expect to become a… a sweeper! You're Lu-Tze! I expected to be apprentice to… well, to the hero!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You did?” Lu-Tze scratched his beard. “Oh, dear. Damn. Yes, I can see the problem. You should've said. Why didn't you say? I don't really do that sort of thing any more.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre9">don't?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All that playing with history, running about, unsettling people… No, not really. I was never quite certain we should be doing it, to be honest. No, sweeping is good enough for me. There's something… <em class="calibre9">real </em>about a nice clean floor.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is a test, isn't it?” said Lobsang coldly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I mean, I understand how it works. The master makes the pupil do all the menial jobs, and then it turns out that really the pupil is learning things of great value… and I don't think I'm learning <em class="calibre9">anything</em>, really, except that people are pretty messy and inconsiderate.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not a bad lesson, all the same,” said Lu-Tze. “Is it not written, ‘Hard work never did anybody any harm’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Where </em>is this written, Lu-Tze?” said Lobsang, thoroughly exasperated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper brightened up. “Ah,” he said. “Perhaps the pupil <em class="calibre9">is</em> ready to learn. Is it that you don't wish to know the Way of the Sweeper, you wish to learn instead the Way of Mrs Cosmopilite?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Who?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We have swept well. Let's go to the gardens. For is it not written, ‘It does you good to get out in the fresh air’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it?” said Lobsang, still bewildered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze pulled a small tattered notebook out of his pocket.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In here, it is,” he said. “I should know.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze patiently adjusted a tiny mirror to redirect sunlight more favourably on one of the bonsai mountains. He hummed tunelessly under his breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang, sitting cross-legged on the stones, carefully turned the yellowing pages of the ancient notebook on which was written, in faded ink, “The Way of Mrs Cosmopilite”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Way has an answer for everything, does it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then…” Lobsang nodded at the little volcano, which was gently smoking, “how does that work? It's on a saucer!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stared straight ahead, his lips moving. “Page seventy-six, I think,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang turned to the page. “‘Because,’” he read.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good answer,” said Lu-Tze, gently caressing a minute crag with a camel-hair brush.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just ‘Because’, Sweeper? No <em class="calibre9">reason</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Reason? What reason can a mountain have? And, as you accumulate years, you will learn that most answers boil down, eventually, to ‘Because’.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang said nothing. The Book of the Way was giving him problems. What he wanted to say was this: Lu-Tze, this reads like a book of the sayings of an old lady. It's the sort of thing old ladies <em class="calibre9">say</em>. What kind of <em class="calibre9">koan </em>is “It won't get better if you pick at it,” or “Eat it up, it'll make your hair curly,” or “Everything comes to he who waits”? This is stuff you get in Hogswatch crackers!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said Lu-Tze, still apparently engrossed in a mountain.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't say anything.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. I thought you did. Do you miss Ankh-Morpork?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I didn't have to sweep floors there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Were you a good thief?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I was a fantastic thief.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A breeze blew the scent of cherry blossom. Just once, thought Lu-Tze, it would be nice to pick cherries.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have been to Ankh-Morpork,” he said, straightening up and moving on to the next mountain. “You have seen the visitors we get here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Lobsang. “Everyone laughs at them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” Lu-Tze raised his eyebrows. “When they have trekked thousands of miles seeking the truth?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But did not Wen say that if the truth is anywhere, it is everywhere?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done. I see you've learned <em class="calibre9">something</em>, at least. But one day it seemed to me that everyone else had decided that wisdom can only be found a long way off. So I went to Ankh-Morpork. They were all coming here, so it seemed only fair.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Seeking <em class="calibre9">enlightenment</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. The wise man does not seek enlightenment, he waits for it. So while I was waiting it occurred to me that seeking perplexity might be more fun,” said Lu-Tze. “After all, enlightenment begins where perplexity ends. And I found perplexity. And a kind of enlightenment, too. I had not been there five minutes, for example, when some men in an alley tried to enlighten me of what little I possessed, giving me a valuable lesson in the ridiculousness of material things.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But <em class="calibre9">why </em>Ankh-Morpork?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look in the back of the book,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a yellow, crackling scrap of paper tucked in there. The boy unfolded it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, this is just a bit of the <em class="calibre9">Almanack</em>,” he said. “It's very popular there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. A seeker after wisdom left it here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… it's just got the Phases of the Moon on this page.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Other side,” said the sweeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang turned the paper over. “It's just an advert from the Ankh-Morpork Guild of Merchants,” he said. “‘Ankh-Morpork Has Everything!’” He stared at the smiling Lu-Tze. “And… you thought that—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, I am old and simple and understand,” said the sweeper. “Whereas you are young and complicated. Didn't Wen see portents in the swirl of gruel in his bowl, and in the flight of birds? This was actually <em class="calibre9">written</em>. I mean, flights of birds are quite complex, but these were <em class="calibre9">words</em>. And, after a lifetime of searching, I saw at last the opening of the Way. <em class="calibre9">My </em>Way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you went all the way to Ankh-Morpork…” said Lobsang weakly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I fetched up, calm of mind but empty of pocket, in Quirm Street,” said the sweeper, smiling serenely at the recollection, “and espied a sign in a window saying ‘Rooms For Rent’. Thus I met Mrs Cosmopilite, who opened the door when I knocked and then when I hesitated, not being sure of the language, she said, ‘I haven't got all day, you know.’ Almost to a word, one of the sayings of Wen! Instantly I knew that I had found what I was seeking! During the days I washed dishes in an eating house for twenty pence a day and all the scraps I could take away, and in the evenings I helped Mrs Cosmopilite clean the house and listened carefully to her conversation. She was a natural sweeper with a good rhythmical motion and had bottomless wisdom. Within the first two days she uttered to me the actual words said by Wen upon understanding the true nature of Time! It was when I asked for a reduced rate because of course I did not sleep in a bed, and she said ‘<em class="calibre9">I was not born yesterday, Mr Tze!</em>’ Astonishing! And she could never have seen the Sacred Texts!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang's face was a carefully drawn picture. “‘I was not born yesterday’?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, yes, of course, as a novice you would not have got that far,” said Lu-Tze. “It was when he fell asleep in a cave and in a dream saw Time appear to him and show him that the universe is recreated from second to second, endlessly, with the past just a memory. And he stepped out from the cave into the truly new world and said, ‘I was not born—yesterday’!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said Lobsang. “But—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, Mrs Cosmopilite,” said Lu-Tze, his eyes misting over. “What a woman for keeping things clean! If she were a sweeper here, no one would be allowed to walk on the floor! Her house! So amazing! A palace! New sheets every other week! And cook? Just to <em class="calibre9">taste </em>her Beans Baked Upon the Toast a man would give up a cycle of the universe!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Um,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I stayed for three months, sweeping her house as is fitting for the pupil, and then I returned here, my Way clear before me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And, er, these stories about you…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, all true. Most of them. A bit of exaggeration, but mostly true.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The one about the citadel in Muntab and the Pash and the fish bone?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But how did you get in where hall a dozen trained and armed men couldn't even—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm a little man and I carry a broom,” said Lu-Tze simply. “Everyone has some mess that needs clearing up. What harm is a man with a broom?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? And that was <em class="calibre9">it</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, the rest was a matter of cookery, really. The Pash was not a good man, but he was a glutton for his fish pie.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No martial arts?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, always a last resort. History needs shepherds, not butchers.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know <em class="calibre9">okidoki</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a lot of bunny-hops.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Shiitake</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If I wanted to thrust my hand into hot sand I would go to the seaside.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Upsidazi?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A waste of good bricks.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">No kando?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You made that one up.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Tung-pi?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bad-tempered flower-arranging.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Deja-fu?</em>” That got a reaction. Lu Tze's eyebrows raised.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Deja-fu?</em> You heard that rumour? Ha! None of the monks here knows <em class="calibre9">deja-fu,</em>” he said. “I'd soon know about it if they did. Look, boy, violence is the resort of the violent. In most tight corners a broomstick suffices.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only most, eh?” said Lobsang, not trying to hide the sarcasm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I <em class="calibre9">see</em>. You wish to face me in the dojo? For it's a very old truth: when the pupil can beat the master, there is nothing the master cannot tell him, because the apprenticeship is ended. You want to learn?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah! I <em class="calibre9">knew </em>there was something to learn!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stood up. “Why you?” he said. “Why here? Why now? ‘There is a time and a place for everything.’ Why this time and this place? If I take you to the dojo, you will return what you stole from me! Now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked down at the teak table where he worked on his mountains.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The little shovel was there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A few cherry blossom petals fluttered to the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see,” he said. “You are that fast? I did not see you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang said nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is a small and worthless thing,” said Lu-Tze. “Why did you take it, please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To see if I could. I was bored.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. We shall see if we can make life more interesting for you, then. No wonder you are bored, when you can already slice time like that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze turned the little shovel over and over in his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very fast,” he said. He leaned down and blew the petals away from a tiny glacier. “You slice time as fast as a Tenth Djim. And as yet barely trained. You must have been a great thief! And now… Oh dear, I shall have to face you in the dojo…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, there is no need!” said Lobsang, because now Lu-Tze looked frightened and humiliated and, somehow, smaller and brittle-boned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I insist,” said the old man. “Let us get it done now. For it is written, ‘There is no time like the present’, which is Mrs Cosmopilite's most profound understanding.” He sighed and looked up at the giant statue of Wen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look at him,” he said. “He was a lad, eh? Completely blissed out on the universe. Saw the past and future as one living <em class="calibre9">person</em>, and wrote the <em class="calibre9">Books of History </em>to tell how the story should go. We can't imagine what those eyes saw. And he never raised a hand to any man in his life.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, I really didn't want to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you've looked at the other statues?” said Lu-Tze, as if he'd completely forgotten about the dojo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Distractedly, Lobsang followed his gaze. Up on the raised stone platform that ran the whole length of the gardens were hundreds of smaller statues, mostly carved of wood, all of them painted in garish colours. Figures with more eyes than legs, more tails than teeth, monstrous amalgamations of fish and squid and tiger and parsnip, things put together as if the creator of the universe had tipped out his box of spare parts and stuck them together, things painted pink and orange and purple and gold, looked down over the valley.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, the <em class="calibre9">dhlang—</em>” Lobsang began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Demons? That's one word for them,” said the sweeper. “The abbot called them the Enemies of Mind. Wen wrote a scroll about them, you know. And he said <em class="calibre9">that </em>was the worst.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He pointed to a little hooded grey shape, which looked out of place among the festival of wild extremities.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Doesn't look very dangerous,” said Lobsang. “Look, Sweeper, I don't want to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They can be very dangerous, things that don't look dangerous,” said Lu-Tze. “Not looking dangerous is what <em class="calibre9">makes </em>them dangerous. For it is written, ‘You can't tell a book by its cover.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze, I really <em class="calibre9">don't </em>want to fight you—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, your tutors will tell you that the discipline of a martial art enables you to slice time, and that's true as far as it goes,” said Lu-Tze, apparently not listening. “But so can sweeping, as perhaps you have found. Always find the perfect moment, Wen said. People just seem so keen on using it to kick other people on the back of the neck.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it wasn't a challenge, I just wanted you to show me—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I shall. Come on. I made a bargain. I must keep it, old fool that I am.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The nearest dojo was the dojo of the Tenth Djim. It was empty except for two monks blurring as they danced across the mat and wrapped time around themselves.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze had been right, Lobsang knew. Time was a resource. You could learn to let it move fast or slow, so that a monk could walk easily through a crowd and yet be moving so fast that no one could see him. Or he could stand still for a few seconds, and watch the sun and moon chase one another across a flickering sky. He could meditate for a day in a minute. Here, in the valley, a day lasted for ever. Blossom never became cherries.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The blurred fighters became a couple of hesitant monks when they saw Lu-Tze. He bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I beg the use of this dojo for a short period while my apprentice teaches me the folly of old age,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I really didn't mean—” Lobsang began, but Lu-Tze elbowed him in the ribs. The monks gave the old man a nervous look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's yours, Lu-Tze,” said one of them. They hurried out, almost tripping over their own feet as they looked back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Time and its control is what we should teach here,” said Lu-Tze, watching them go. “The martial arts are an aid. That is all they are. At least, that's all they were meant to be. Even out in the world a well-trained person may perceive, in the fray, how flexible time may be. Here, we can build on that. Compress time. Stretch time. Hold the moment. Punching people's kidneys out through their nose is only a foolish by-product.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze took down a razor-edged <em class="calibre9">pika </em>sword from the rack and handed it to the shocked boy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've seen one of these before? They're not really for novices, but you show promise.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Know how to use it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm good with the practice ones, but they're just made of—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Take it, then, and attack me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a rustling noise above them. Lobsang looked up and saw monks pouring into the observation gallery above the dojo. There were some very senior ones among them. News gets around quickly in a little world.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Rule Two,” said Lu-Tze, “is never refuse a weapon.” He took a few steps back. “In your own time, boy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang wielded the curved sword uncertainly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't just—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is this the dojo of the Tenth Djim?” said Lu-Tze. “Why, mercy me, I do believe it is. That means there are no rules, doesn't it? Any weapon, any strategy… anything is allowed. Do you understand? Are you stupid?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I can't just kill someone because they've <em class="calibre9">asked </em>me to!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why not? What happened to Mr Manners?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You are holding a deadly weapon! You are facing an unarmed man in a pose of submission! Are you frightened?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes! Yes, I am!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. That's the Third Rule,” said Lu-Tze quietly. “See how much you're learning already? Wiped the smile off your face, have I? All right, put the sword on the rack and take—Yes, take a <em class="calibre9">dakka </em>stick. The most you can do with that is bruise my old bones.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I would prefer it if you wore the protective padding—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're that good with the stick, are you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm very fast—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then if you don't fight right now I shall wrest it from you and break it over your head,” said Lu-Tze, drawing back. “Ready? The only defence is to attack well, I'm told.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang tilted the stick in reluctant salute.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze folded his hands and, as Lobsang danced towards him, closed his eyes and smiled to himself.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang raised the stick again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And hesitated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was grinning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rule Two, Rule Three… What had been Rule One?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Always remember Rule One…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot's chief acolyte arrived panting in the doorway, waving urgently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze opened one eye, and then the other one, and then winked at Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Narrow escape there, eh?” he said. He turned to the acolyte. “Yes, exalted sir?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You must come immediately! And all monks who are cleared for a tour in the world! To the Mandala Hall! Now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a scuffling in the gallery and several monks pushed their way out through the crowd.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, excitement,” said Lu-Tze, taking the stick from Lobsang's unresisting hands and putting it back into the rack. The hall was emptying fast. Around the whole of Oi Dong, gongs were being banged frantically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's happening?” said Lobsang, as the last of the monks surged past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I daresay we shall soon be told,” said Lu-Tze, starting to roll himself a cigarette.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hadn't we better hurry? Everyone's going!” The sound of flapping sandals died away in the distance.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nothing seems to be on fire,” said Lu-Tze calmly. “Besides, if we wait a little then by the time we get there everyone will have stopped shouting and perhaps they will be making some sense. Let us take the Clock Path. The display is particularly fine at this time of day.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… but…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is written ‘You've got to learn to walk before you can run,’” said Lu-Tze, putting his broom over his shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Cosmopilite again?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Amazing woman. Dusted like a demon, too.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Clock Path wound out from the main complex, up through the terraced gardens, and then rejoined the wider path as it tunnelled into the cliff wall. Novices always asked why it was called the Clock Path, since there was no sign of a clock anywhere.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">More gongs started to bang, but they were muffled by the greenery. Lobsang heard running feet up on the main path. Down here, humming birds flickered from flower to flower, oblivious of any excitement.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wonder what time it is,” said Lu-Tze, who was walking ahead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Everything is a test. Lobsang glanced around at the flowerbed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A quarter past nine,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh? And how do you know that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The field marigold is open, the red sandwort is opening, the purple bindweed is closed, and the yellow goat's beard is closing,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You worked out the floral clock all by yourself?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. It's obvious.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? What time is it when the white waterlily opens?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Six in the morning.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You came to look?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. You planted this garden, did you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One of my little… efforts.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's beautiful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's not very accurate in the small hours. There aren't too many night-blooming plants that grow well up here. They open for the moths, you know—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's how time wants to be measured,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? Of course I'm not an expert,” said Lu-Tze. He pinched out the end of his cigarette and stuck it behind his ear. “Oh well, let's keep going. Everyone may have stopped arguing at cross purposes by now. How do you feel about going through the Mandala Hall again?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I'll be fine, I'd just… forgotten about it, that's all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? And you'd never seen it before, too. But time plays funny tricks on us all. Why, I once—” Lu-Tze stopped, and stared at the apprentice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you all right?” he said. “You've gone pale.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang grimaced and shook his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Something… felt odd,” he said. He vaguely waved a hand in the direction of the lowlands, spread out in a blue and grey pattern on the horizon. “Something… over there…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">The glass clock. The great glass house and here, where it shouldn't be, the glass clock. It was barely here; it showed up as shimmering lines in the air, as if it was possible to capture the sparkle of light off a shiny surface without the surface itself</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Everything here was transparent—delicate chairs, tables, vases of flowers. And now he realized that glass was not a word to use here. Crystal might be better; or ice—the thin, flawless ice you sometimes got after a sharp frost. Everything was visible only by its edges</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">He could make out staircases through distant walls. Above and below and to every side, the glass rooms went on for ever</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">And yet it was all familiar. It felt like home</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Sound filled the glass rooms. It streamed away in clear sharp notes, like the tones made by a wet finger around a wineglass rim. There was movement, too—a haze in the air beyond the transparent walls, shifting and wavering and… watching him</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How can it come from over there? And how do you mean, odd?” said the voice of Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang blinked. <em class="calibre9">This </em>was the odd place, the one right here, the rigid and unbending world…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then the feeling passed, and faded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just odd. For a moment,” he mumbled. There was dampness on his cheek. He raised his hand, and touched wetness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's that rancid yak butter they put in the tea, I've always said so,” said Lu-Tze. “Mrs Cosmopilite never—Now <em class="calibre9">that </em>is unusual,” he said, looking up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? What?” said Lobsang, looking blankly at his wet fingertips and then up at the cloudless sky.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A Procrastinator going overspeed.” He shifted position. “Can't you feel it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't hear anything!” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not hear, <em class="calibre9">feel</em>. Coming up through your sandals? Oops, there goes another one… and another. You <em class="calibre9">can't </em>feel it? That one's… that's old Sixty-Six, they've never got it properly balanced. We'll hear them in a minute… Oh dear. Look at the flowers. Do look at the flowers!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang turned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The ice plants were opening. The field sowthistle was closing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Time-leak,” said Lu-Tze. “Hark at that! You can hear them now, eh? They're dumping time randomly! Come on!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">According to the Second Scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised</em>, Wen the Eternally Surprised sawed the first Procrastinator from the trunk of a <em class="calibre9">wamwam </em>tree, carved certain symbols on it, fitted it with a bronze spindle and summoned the apprentice, Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Very nice, master,” said Clodpool. “A prayer wheel, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, this is nothing like as complex,” said Wen. “It merely stores and moves time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That simple, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now I shall test it,” said Wen. He gave it a half-turn with his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Very nice, master,” said Clodpool. “A prayer wheel, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, this is nothing like as complex,” said Wen. “It merely stores and moves time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That simple, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now I shall test it,” said Wen. He moved it a little less this time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That simple, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now I shall test it,” said Wen. This time he twisted it gently to and fro.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That si-si-si That simple-ple, eh eheh simple, eh?” said Clodpool.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I have tested it,” said Wen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It worked, master?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I think so.” Wen stood up. “Give me the rope that you used to carry the firewood. And… yes, a pit from one of those cherries you picked yesterday.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He wound the frayed rope around the cylinder and tossed the pit onto a patch of mud. Clodpool jumped out of the way.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“See those mountains?” said Wen, tugging the rope. The cylinder spun and balanced there, humming gently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh yes, master,” said Clodpool obediently. There was practically nothing up here <em class="calibre9">but </em>mountains; there were so many that sometimes they were impossible to see; because they got in the way.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How much time does stone need?” said Wen. “Or the deep sea? We shall move it”—he placed his left hand just above the spinning blur—“to where it is needed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked down at the cherry pit. His lips moved silently, as though he was working through some complex puzzle. Then he pointed his right hand at the pit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Stand back,” he said, and gently let a finger touch the cylinder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no sound except the crack of the air as it moved aside, and a hiss of steam from the mud.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen looked up at the new tree, and smiled. “I did <em class="calibre9">say </em>you should stand back,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I, er, I shall get down now, then, shall I?” said a voice among the blossom-laden branches.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But carefully,” said Wen, and sighed as Clodpool crashed down in a shower of petals.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There will always be cherry blossom here,” he said.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze hitched up his robe and scurried back down the path. Lobsang ran after him. A high-pitched whine seemed to be coming out of the rocks. The sweeper skidded at the carp pond, which was now erupting in strange waves, and headed down a shady track alongside a stream. Red ibises erupted into flight—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stopped, and threw himself flat on the paving slabs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Get down <em class="calibre9">now</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But Lobsang was already headlong. He heard something pass overhead with a plangent sound. He looked back and saw the last ibis tumbling in the air, shrinking, shedding feathers, surrounded by a halo of pale blue light. It squawked and vanished with a “pop”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Not vanished <em class="calibre9">entirely</em>. An egg followed the same trajectory for a few seconds, and then smashed on the stones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Random time! Come on, come on!” shouted Lu-Tze. He scrambled to his feet again, headed towards an ornamental grille in the cliff face ahead of them, and with surprising strength wrenched it out of the wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a bit of a drop but if you roll when you land you'll be okay,” he said, lowering himself into the hole.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where does it go to?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Procrastinators, of course!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But novices aren't allowed in there on pain of death!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's a coincidence,” said Lu-Tze, lowering himself to the tips of his fingers. “Because death is what awaits you if you stay out there, too.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He dropped into the darkness. A moment later there was an unenlightened curse from below.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang climbed in, hung by his fingertips, dropped and rolled when he hit the floor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done,” said Lu-Tze in the gloom. “When in doubt, choose to live. This way!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The passageway opened into a wide corridor. The noise here was shattering. Something mechanical was in agony.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a “crump” and, a few moments later, a babble of voices.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Several dozen monks, wearing thick cork hats as well as their traditional robes, came running round the corner. Most of them were yelling. A few of the brighter ones were saving their breath in order to cover the ground more quickly. Lu-Tze grabbed one of them, who tried to struggle free.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Let me go!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's happening?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just get out of here before they <em class="calibre9">all </em>go!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The monk shook himself free and sped after the rest of them. Lu-Tze bent down, picked up a fallen cork helmet, and solemnly handed it to Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Health and safety at work,” he said. “Very important.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Will it protect me?” said Lobsang, putting it on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not really. But when they find your head, it may be recognizable. When we get into the hall, <em class="calibre9">don't touch anything</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang had been expecting some vaulted, magnificent structure. People talked about the Procrastinator Hall as if it was some kind of huge cathedral. But what there was, at the end of the passage, was a haze of blue smoke. It was only when his eyes became accustomed to the swirling gloom that he saw the nearest cylinder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a squat pillar of rock, about three yards across and six yards high. It was spinning so fast that it was a blur. Around it the air flickered with slivers of silver-blue light.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“See? They're dumping! Over here! Quick!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang ran after Lu-Tze, and saw there were hundreds—no, <em class="calibre9">thousands </em>–of the cylinders, some of them reaching all the way to the cavern roof.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were still monks in here, running to and from the wells with buckets of water, which flashed into steam when they threw it over the smoking stone bearings at the base of the cylinders.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Idiots,” the sweeper muttered. He cupped his hands and shouted, “Where-is-the-overseer?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang pointed down to the edge of a wooden podium built onto the wall of the hall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a rotting cork hat there, and a pair of ancient sandals. In between was a pile of grey dust.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Poor fellow,” said Lu-Tze. “A full fifty thousand years in one jolt, I'd say.” He glared at the scurrying monks again. “Will you lot stop and come here! I ain't going to ask you twice!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Several of them swept the sweat out of their eyes and trotted towards the podium, relieved to hear any kind of order, while behind them the Procrastinators screamed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right!” said Lu-Tze, as they were joined by more and more. “Now listen to me! This is just a surge cascade! You've all heard of them! We can deal with it! We just have to cross-link futures and pasts, fastest ones first—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Poor Mr Shoblang already tried that,” said a monk. He nodded at the sad pile.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then I want two teams—” Lu-Tze stopped. “No, we haven't got time! We'll do it by the soles of our feet, like we used to do! One man to a spinner, just smack the bars when I say! Ready to go when I call the numbers!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze climbed onto the podium and ran his eye over a board covered with wooden bobbins. A red or blue nimbus hovered over each one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What a mess,” he said. “What a <em class="calibre9">mess</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do they <em class="calibre9">mean</em>?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's hands hovered over the bobbins. “Okay. The red-tinted ones are winding time out, speeding it up,” he said. “The blue-tinted ones, they're winding time in, slowing it down. Brightness of the colour, that's how fast they're doing it. Except that now they're all freewheeling because the surge cut them loose, understand?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Loose from what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“From the load. From the <em class="calibre9">world</em>. See up there?” He waved a hand towards two long racks that ran all the way along the cavern wall. Each one held a row of swivelling shutters, one line blue, one line dark red.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The more shutters showing a colour, the more time winding or unwinding?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good lad! Got to keep it balanced! And the way we get through this is we couple the spinners up in twos, so that they wind and unwind one another. Cancel themselves out. Poor old Shoblang was trying to put them back into service, I reckon. Can't be done, not during a cascade. You've got to let it all fall over, and then pick up the pieces when it's nice and quiet.” He glanced at the bobbins and then at the crowd of monks. “Right. You… 128 to 17, and then 45 to 89. Off you go. And <em class="calibre9">you</em>… 596 to, let's see… yes, 402…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Seven hundred and ninety!” shouted Lobsang, pointing to a bobbin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Seven hundred and ninety!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't be daft. That's still unwinding, lad. Four hundred and two is our man, right here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Seven hundred and ninety is about to start winding time again!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's still bright blue.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's going to wind. I know it. Because”—the novice's finger moved over the lines of bobbins, hesitated, and pointed to a bobbin on the other side of the board—“it's matching speeds with this one.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze peered. “It is written, ‘Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs!’” he said. “They're forming a natural inversion.” He squinted at Lobsang. “You're not the reincarnation of someone, are you? That happens a lot in these parts.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think so. It's just… obvious.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A moment ago you didn't know anything about these!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, yes, but when you see them… it's obvious.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it? <em class="calibre9">Is </em>it? All right. Then the board's yours, wonder boy!” Lu-Tze stood back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mine? But I—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Get on with it! That is an <em class="calibre9">order</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For a moment there was a suggestion of blue light around Lobsang. Lu-Tze wondered how much time he'd folded around himself in that second. Time enough to think, certainly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then the boy called out half a dozen pairs of numbers. Lu-Tze turned to the monks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Jump to it, boys. Mr Lobsang has the board! You boys just watch those bearings!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But he's a novice—” one of the monks began, and stopped and backed away when he saw Lu-Tze's expression. “All right, Sweeper… all right…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A moment later there was the sound of jumpers slamming into place. Lobsang called out another set of numbers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">While the monks dashed to and fro to the butter pits for grease, Lu-Tze watched the nearest column. It was still spinning fast, but he was sure he could see the carvings.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang ran his eye over the board again and stared up at the rumbling cylinders, and then back to the lines of shutters. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">There wasn't anything written down about all this, Lu-Tze knew. You couldn't teach it in a classroom, although they tried. A good spin driver learned it through the soles of his feet, for all the theory that they taught you these days. He'd learn to <em class="calibre9">feel </em>the flows, to see the rows of Procrastinators as sinks or fountains of time. Old Shoblang had been so good that he'd been able to pull a couple of hours of wasted time from a classroom of bored pupils without their even noticing, and dump it into a busy workshop a thousand miles away as neat as you pleased.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then there was that trick he used to do with an apple to amaze the apprentices. He'd put it on a pillar next to them, and then flick time at it off one of the small spindles. In an instant it'd be a collection of small, spindly trees before crumbling to dust. That's what'll happen to you if you get things wrong, he'd say.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze glanced down at the pile of grey dust under the disintegrating hat as he hurried past. Well, maybe it was the way he'd want to go—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A scream of tormented stone made him look up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Keep those bearings greased, you lazy devils!” he yelled, running down the rows. “And watch those rails! Hands off the splines! We're doing fine!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As he ran he kept his eyes on the columns. They were no longer turning randomly. Now, they had purpose.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think you're winning, lad!” he shouted to the figure on the podium.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but I can't balance it! There's too much time wound up and nowhere to put it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How much?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Almost forty years!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze glanced at the shutters. Forty years looked about right, but surely—?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">How </em>much?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Forty! I'm sorry! There's nothing to take it up!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No problem! Steal it! Shed load! We can always pull it back later! Dump it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Find a big patch of sea!” The sweeper pointed to a crude map of the world painted on the wall. “Do you know how to—Can you <em class="calibre9">see </em>how to give it the right spin and direction?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Once again, there was the blueness in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes! I think so!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I imagine you do! In your own time, then!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze shook his head. Forty years? He was worried about <em class="calibre9">forty years</em>? Forty years was nothing! Apprentice drivers had dumped fifty thousand years before now. That was the thing about the sea. It just stayed big and wet. It always had been big and wet, it always would be big and wet. Oh, maybe fishermen would start to dredge up strange whiskery fish that they'd only ever seen before as fossils, but who cared what happened to a bunch of codfish?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sound changed. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you doing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've found space on number 422! It can take another forty years! No sense in wasting time! I'm pulling it back <em class="calibre9">now</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was another change of tone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Got it! I'm sure I've <em class="calibre9">got </em>it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some of the bigger cylinders were already slowing to a halt. Lobsang was moving pegs around the board now faster than the bewildered Lu-Tze could follow. And, overhead, the shutters were slamming back, one after another, showing age-blackened wood instead of colour.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">No one </em>could be that accurate, could they?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're down to months now, lad, months!” he shouted. “Keep it up! No, blimey, you're down to days… <em class="calibre9">days</em>! Keep an eye on me!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper ran towards the end of the hall, to where the Procrastinators were smaller. Time was fine-tuned here, on cylinders of chalk and wood and other short-lived materials. To his amazement, some of them were already slowing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He raced down an aisle of oak columns a few feet high. But even the Procrastinators that could wind time in hours and minutes were falling silent.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a squeaking noise.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Beside him, one final little chalk cylinder at the end of a row rattled around on its bearing like a spinning-top.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze crept towards it, staring at it intently, one hand raised. The squeaking was the only sound now, apart from the occasional <em class="calibre9">clink </em>of cooling bearings.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nearly there,” he called out. “Slowing down now… wait for it, wait… for… it…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The chalk Procrastinator, no bigger than a reel of cotton, slowed, spun… stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the racks, the last two shutters closed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's hand fell.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Now! Kill the board! No one touch a thing!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For a moment there was dead silence in the hall. The monks watched, holding their breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This was a timeless moment, of perfect balance.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">And in that timeless moment the ghost of Mr Shoblang, to whom the scene was hazy and fuzzy as though seen through a gauze, said, “This is just <em class="calibre9">impossible</em>! Did you see that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SEE WHAT? said a dark figure behind him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Shoblang turned. “Oh,” he said, and added with sudden certainty, “You're Death, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. I AM SORRY I AM LATE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spirit formerly known as Shoblang looked down at the pile of dust that represented his worldly habitation for the previous six hundred years.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So am I,” he said. He nudged Death in the ribs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EXCUSE ME?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I said, ‘I'm sorry I'm late.’ Boom, boom.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I BEG YOUR PARDON?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, you know… Sorry I'm <em class="calibre9">late</em>. Like… dead?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death nodded. OH, I SEE. IT WAS THE “BOOM BOOM” I DID NOT UNDERSTAND.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, that was to show it was a joke,” said Shoblang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH, YES. I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. IN FACT, MR SHOBLANG, WHILE YOU ARE LATE, YOU ARE ALSO EARLY. BOOM, BOOM.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pardon?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU HAVE DIED BEFORE YOUR TIME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, yes, <em class="calibre9">I </em>should think so!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY? IT'S VERY UNUSUAL.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All I know is that the spinners went wild and I must've copped a load when one of 'em went overspeed,” said Shoblang. “But, hey, what about that kid, eh? Look at the way he's making the buggers dance! I wish I'd had him training under me! What am I saying? He could give <em class="calibre9">me </em>a few tips!” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death looked around. TO WHOM DO YOU REFER?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That boy up on the podium, see him?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NO, I'M AFRAID I SEE NO ONE THERE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? Look, he's right <em class="calibre9">there</em>! Plain as the nose on your fa—Well, obviously not on <em class="calibre9">your </em>face…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SEE THE COLOURED PEGS MOVING…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, who do you think is moving them? I mean, you <em class="calibre9">are </em>Death, right? I thought you could see everyone!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death stared at the dancing bobbins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERYONE… THAT I SHOULD SEE, he said. He continued to stare.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ahem,” said Shoblang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">OH, YES. WHERE WERE WE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, if I'm, er, too early, then can't you—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS STAYS HAPPENED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What kind of philosophy is that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS. Death took out an hourglass and consulted it. I SEE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM YOU ARE NOT DUE TO REINCARNATE FOR SEVENTY-NINE YEARS. DO YOU HAVE ANYWHERE TO STAY?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Stay? I'm <em class="calibre9">dead</em>. It's not like locking yourself out of your own house!” said Shoblang, who was beginning to fade.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">PERHAPS YOU COULD BE BUMPED UP TO AN EARLIER BIRTH?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Shoblang vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the timeless moment Death turned back to stare at the hall of spinners…</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The chalk cylinder started to spin again, squeaking gently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One by one, the oak Procrastinators began to revolve, picking up the rising load. This time there was no scream of bearings. They twirled slowly, like old ballerinas, this way and that, gradually taking up the strain as millions of humans in the world outside bent time around themselves. The creaking sounded like a teaclipper rounding Cape Wrath on a gentle breeze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then the big stone cylinders groaned as they picked up the time their smaller brethren couldn't handle. A rumbling underlay the creaking now, but it was still gentle, controlled…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze lowered his hand gently and straightened up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A nice clean pick-up,” he said. “Well done, everyone.” He turned to the astonished, panting monks and beckoned the most senior towards him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze pulled a ragged cigarette end out of its lodging behind his ear and said, “Well now, Rambut Handisides, what d'you think happened just now, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, well, there was a surge which blew out—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nah, nah, after that,” said Lu-Tze, striking a match on the sole of his sandal. “See, what I <em class="calibre9">don't</em> think happened was that you boys ran around like a lot of headless chickens and a novice got up on the platform and did the sweetest, smoothest bit of rebalancing that I've ever seen. That couldn't have happened, because <em class="calibre9">that sort of thing does not happen</em>. Am I right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The monks of the Procrastinator floor were not among the temple's great political thinkers. Their job was to tend and grease and strip down and rebuild and follow the directions of the man on the platform. Rambut Handisides' brow wrinkled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze sighed. “See, what <em class="calibre9">I </em>think happened,” he said helpfully, “was that you lads rose to the occasion, right, and left myself and the young man there aghast at the practical skills you all showed. The abbot will be impressed and blow happy bubbles. You could be looking at some extra <em class="calibre9">momos </em>in your <em class="calibre9">thugpa </em>come dinner-time, if you get my drift?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Handisides ran this up his mental flagpole and it did indeed send prayers to heaven. He began to smile.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">However</em>,” said Lu-Tze, stepping closer and lowering his voice, “I'll probably be around again soon, this place looks as though it could do with a good sweeping, and if I don't find you boys pin-sharp and prodding buttock inside a week, you and I will have a… talk.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The smile vanished. “Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've got to test them all and see to those bearings.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And someone clear up Mr Shoblang.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fair play to you, then. Me and young Lobsang here will be going. You've done a lot for his education.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He took the unresisting Lobsang by the hand and led him out of the hall, past the long lines of turning, humming Procrastinators. A pall of blue smoke still hung under the high ceiling.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Truly it is written, ‘You could knock me down with a feather,’” he muttered, as they headed up the sloping passage. “You spotted that inversion before it happened. I'd have blown us into next week. At <em class="calibre9">least</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry? You don't have to be <em class="calibre9">sorry</em>. I don't know what you <em class="calibre9">are</em>, son. You're too quick. You're taking to this place like a duck to water. You don't have to learn stuff that takes other people years to get the hang of. Old Shoblang, may he be reincarnated somewhere nice and warm, even he couldn't balance the load down to a second. I mean, a <em class="calibre9">second</em>. Over a whole damn <em class="calibre9">world</em>!” He shuddered. “Here's a tip. Don't let it show. People can be funny about that sort of thing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And another thing,” said Lu-Tze, leading the way out into the light. “What was all that fuss just before the Procrastinators cut loose? You felt something?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know. I just felt… everything went wrong for a moment.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ever happened before?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No-o. It was a bit like what happened in the Mandala Hall.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, don't talk about it to anyone else. Most of the high-ups these days probably don't even know how the spinners work. No one <em class="calibre9">cares </em>about them any more. No one notices something that works too well. Of course, in the old days you weren't even allowed to become a monk until you'd spent six months in the hall, greasing and cleaning and fetching. And we were better for it! These days it's all about learning obedience and cosmic harmony. Well, in the old days you learned that in the halls. You learned that if you didn't jump out of the way when someone yelled, ‘She's dumping!’ you got a couple of years where it hurt, and that there's no harmony better than all the spinners turning sweetly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The passage rose into the main temple complex. People were still scurrying around as they headed for the Mandala Hall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're sure you can look at it again?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Okay. You know best.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The balconies overlooking the hall were crowded with monks, but Lu-Tze worked his way forward by polite yet firm use of his broom. The senior monks were clustered at the edge.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rinpo caught sight of him. “Ah, Sweeper,” he said. “Some dust delayed you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Spinners cut free and went overspeed,” muttered Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but you <em class="calibre9">were </em>summoned by the abbot,” said the acolyte reproachfully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Upon a time,” said Lu-Tze, “every man jack of us would have legged it down to the hall when the gongs went.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">BRRRRbrrrrbrrrr,</em>” said the abbot, and Lobsang saw now that he was being carried in a sling on the acolyte's back, with an embroidered pixie hood on his head to keep off the chill. “Lu-Tze always was very keen on the practical approach <em class="calibre9">BRRRbrrr</em>.” He blew milky suds into the acolyte's ear. “I am glad matters have been resolved, Lu-Tze.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper bowed, while the abbot started to beat the acolyte gently over the head with a wooden bear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“History has repeated, Lu-Tze. <em class="calibre9">DumDumBBBRRRR</em>…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Glass clock?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The senior monks gasped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How could you possibly know that?” said the chief acolyte. “We haven't rerun the Mandala yet!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is written, ‘I've got a feeling in my water,’” said Lu-Tze. “And that was the only other time I ever heard of when all the spinners went wild like that. They <em class="calibre9">all </em>cut loose. Time-slip. Someone's building a glass clock again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is quite impossible,” said the acolyte. “We removed every trace!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! It is written, ‘I'm not as green as I'm cabbage-looking!’” snapped Lu-Tze. “Something like that you <em class="calibre9">can't </em>kill. It leaks back. Stories. Dreams. Paintings on cave walls, whatever—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked down at the Mandala floor. Monks were clustered around a group of tall cylinders at the far end of the hall. They looked like Procrastinators, but only one small one was spinning, slowly. The others were motionless, showing the mass of symbols that were carved into them from top to bottom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Pattern storage</em>. The thought arrived in his head. That is where the Mandala's patterns are kept, so that they can be replayed. Today's patterns on the little one, long-term storage on the big ones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Below him the Mandala rippled, blotches of colour and scraps of pattern drifting across its surface. One of the distant monks called out something, and the small cylinder stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rolling sand grains were stilled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is how it looked twenty minutes ago,” said Rinpo. “See the blue-white dot there? And then it spreads—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I know what I'm looking at,” said Lu-Tze grimly. “I was <em class="calibre9">there </em>when it happened before, man! Your Reverence, get them to run the old Glass Clock sequence! We haven't got a lot of time!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I really think we—” the acolyte began, but he was interrupted by a blow from a rubber brick.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Wannapottywanna </em>if Lu-Tze is right, then we must not waste time, gentlemen, and if he is wrong then we have time to spare, is this not so? <em class="calibre9">Pottynowwannawanna</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” said the sweeper. He cupped his hands. “Oi! You lot! Spindle two, fourth <em class="calibre9">bhing</em>, round about the nineteenth <em class="calibre9">gupa</em>! And jump to it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I really must respectfully protest, Your Reverence,” said the acolyte. “We have practised for just such an emergency as—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah, I know all about practising procedures for emergencies,” said Lu-Tze. “And there's always something missing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ridiculous! We take great pains to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You always leave out the damn emergency.” Lu-Tze turned back to the hall and the apprehensive workers. “Ready? Good! Put it on the floor <em class="calibre9">now</em>! Or I shall have to come down there! And I don't <em class="calibre9">want </em>to have to come down there!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was some frantic activity by the men around the cylinders, and a new pattern replaced the one below the balcony. The lines and colours were in different places, but a blue-white circle occupied the centre.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There,” said Lu-Tze. “That was less than ten days before the clock struck.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was silence from the monks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze smiled grimly. “And ten days later—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Time stopped,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's one way of putting it,” said Lu-Tze. He'd gone red in the face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the monks put a hand on his shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's <em class="calibre9">all right</em>, Sweeper,” he said soothingly. “We <em class="calibre9">know </em>you couldn't have got there in time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Being in time is supposed to be what we <em class="calibre9">do</em>,” said Lu-Tze. “I was nearly at the damn <em class="calibre9">door</em>, Charlie. Too many castles, not enough… time…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Behind him the Mandala returned to its slow metering of the present.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It wasn't your fault,” said the monk.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze shook the hand free and turned to face the abbot over the shoulder of the chief acolyte.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I want permission to track this one down right now, reverend sir!” he said. He tapped his nose. “I've got the smell of it! I've been waiting for this all these years! You won't find me wanting this time!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the silence the abbot blew a bubble.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It'll be in Uberwald again,” said Lu-Tze, a hint of pleading in his voice. “That's where they mess around with the electrick. I know every inch of that place! Give me a couple of men and we can nip this right in the bud!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Bababababa</em>… This needs discussion, Lu-Tze, but we thank you for your offer <em class="calibre9">babababa</em>,” said the abbot. “Rinpo, I want all <em class="calibre9">bdumbdumbdum </em>senior field monks in the Room of Silence within five <em class="calibre9">bababa </em>minutes! Are the spinners working <em class="calibre9">bdumbdum </em>harmoniously?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the monks looked up from a scroll he'd been handed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It appears so, Your Reverence.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My congratulations to the board master <em class="calibre9">BIKKIT</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But Shoblang is dead,” murmured Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot stopped blowing bubbles. “That is sad news. And he was a friend of yours, I understand.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Shouldn't've happened like that,” the sweeper muttered. “Shouldn't've happened like that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Compose yourself, Lu-Tze. I will talk to you shortly. <em class="calibre9">Bikkit</em>!” The chief acolyte, spurred on by a blow across the ear with a rubber monkey, hurried away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The press of monks began to thin out as they went about their duties. Lu-Tze and Lobsang were left on the balcony, looking down at the rippling Mandala.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze cleared his throat. “See them spinners at the end?” he said. “The little one records the patterns for a day, and then anything interesting is stored in the big ones.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just premembered you were going to say that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good word. Good word. The lad has talent.” Lu-Tze lowered his voice. “Anyone watching us?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked around. “There's a few people still here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze raised his voice again. “You been taught anything about the Big Crash?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only rumours, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah, there were a lot of rumours. ‘The day time stood still’, all that sort of thing.” Lu-Tze sighed. “Y'know, most of what you get taught is lies. It has to be. Sometimes if you get the truth all at once, you can't understand it. You knew Ankh-Morpork pretty well, did you? Ever go to the opera house?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only for pickpocket practice, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ever <em class="calibre9">wonder </em>about it? Ever look at that little theatre just over the road? Called The Dysk, I think.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes! We got penny tickets and sat on the ground and threw nuts at the stage.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And it didn't make you <em class="calibre9">think</em>? Big opera house, all plush and gilt and big orchestras, and then there's this little thatched theatre, all bare wood and no seats and one bloke playing a crumhorn for musical accompaniment?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang shrugged. “Well, no. That's just how things are.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze almost smiled. “Very flexible things, human minds,” he said. “It's amazing what they can stretch to fit. We did a fine job there—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the lesser acolytes was waiting respectfully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The abbot will see you now,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, right,” said the sweeper. He nudged Lobsang and whispered, “We're going to Ankh-Morpork, lad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? But you said you wanted to be sent to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze winked. “'Cos it is written, ‘Them as asks, don't get,’ see. There's more than one way of choking a <em class="calibre9">dangdang </em>than stuffing it with <em class="calibre9">pling</em>, lad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh yes, if you've got enough <em class="calibre9">pling</em>. Now let's see the abbot, shall we? It'll be time for his feed now. Solids, thank goodness. At least he's done with the wetnurse. It was so embarrassing for him and the young lady, honestly, you didn't know where to put your face and neither did he. I mean, mentally he's nine hundred years old…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That must make him very wise.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pretty wise, pretty wise. But age and wisdom don't necessarily go together, I've always found,” said Lu-Tze, as they approached the abbot's rooms. “Some people just become stupid with more authority. Not His Reverence, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot was in his highchair, and had recently flicked a spoonful of nourishing pap all over the chief acolyte, who was smiling like a man whose job depended on looking happy that parsnip-and-gooseberry custard was dribbling down his forehead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It occurred to Lobsang, not for the first time, that the abbot was a little bit more than purely random in his attacks on the man. The acolyte was, indeed, the kind of mildly objectionable person who engendered an irresistible urge in any right-thinking person to pour goo into his hair and hit him with a rubber yak, and the abbot was old enough to listen to his inner child.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You sent for me, Your Reverence,” said Lu-Tze, bowing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot upturned his bowl down the chief acolyte's robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Wahahaahaha ah</em>, yes, Lu-Tze. How old are you now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Eight hundred, Your Reverence. But that's no age at all!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless, you have spent a lot of time in the world. I understood you were looking to retire and cultivate your gardens?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But,” the abbot smiled angelically, “like an old warhorse you say ‘haha!’ at the sound of trumpets, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think so,” said Lu-Tze. “There's nothing funny about trumpets, really.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I meant that you long to be out in the field again. But you <em class="calibre9">have </em>been helping to train world operatives for many years, haven't you? These gentlemen?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A number of burly and muscular monks were sitting on one side of the room. They were kitted out for travel, with rolled sleeping mats on their backs, and dressed in loose black clothing. They nodded sheepishly at Lu-Tze, and their eyes above their half-masks looked embarrassed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I did my best,” said Lu-Tze. “Of course, others trained them. I just tried to undo the damage. I never taught them to be <em class="calibre9">ninjas</em>.” He nudged Lobsang. “That, apprentice, is Agatean for ‘the Passing Wind’,” he said, in a stage whisper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am proposing to send them out immediately <em class="calibre9">WAH!</em>” The abbot hit his high chair with his spoon. “That is my order, Lu-Tze. You are a legend… but you have been a legend for a long time. Why not trust in the future? <em class="calibre9">Bikkit</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see,” said Lu-Tze sadly. “Oh, well, it had to happen sometime. Thank you for your consideration, Your Reverence.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Brrmbrrm</em>… Lu-Tze, I have known you a long time! You will not go within a hundred miles of Uberwald, will you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not at all, Your Reverence.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is an order!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I understand, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've disobeyed my <em class="calibre9">baababa </em>orders before, though. In Omnia, I remember.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Tactical decision made by the man on the spot, Your Reverence. It was more what you might call an <em class="calibre9">interpretation </em>of your order,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean, going where you had distinctly been told not to go and doing what you were absolutely forbidden to do?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Your Reverence. Sometimes you have to move the seesaw by pushing the other end. When I did what shouldn't be done in a place where I shouldn't have been, I <em class="calibre9">achieved </em>what needed to be done in the place where it should have happened.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot gave Lu-Tze a long hard stare, the kind that babies are good at giving.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze, you are not <em class="calibre9">nmnmnbooboo </em>to go to Uberwald or anywhere near Uberwald, understand?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I do, Your Reverence. You are right, of course. But, in my dotage, may I travel another path, of wisdom rather than violence? I wish to show this young man… the Way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was laughter from the other monks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The Way of the Washerwoman?” said Rinpo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Cosmopilite is a dressmaker,” said Lu-Tze calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Whose wisdom is in sayings like ‘It won't get better if you pick at it’?” said Rinpo, winking at the rest of the monks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Few things get better if you pick at them,” said Lu-Tze, and now his calmness was a lake of tranquillity. “It may be a mean little Way but, small and unworthy though it is, it is <em class="calibre9">my </em>Way.” He turned to the abbot. “That was how it used to be, Your Reverence. You recall? Master and pupil go out into the world, where the pupil may pick up practical instruction by precept and example, and then the pupil finds his own Way and at the end of his Way—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—he finds himself <em class="calibre9">bdum</em>,” said the abbot. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“First, he finds a teacher,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He is lucky that you will <em class="calibre9">bdumbdum </em>be that teacher.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Reverend Sir,” said Lu-Tze. “It is in the nature of Ways that none can be sure who the teacher may be. All I can do is show him a path.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Which will be in the direction of <em class="calibre9">bdum </em>the city,” said the abbot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Lu-Tze. “And Ankh-Morpork is a <em class="calibre9">long </em>way from Uberwald. You won't send me to Uberwald because I am an old man. So, in all respect, I beg you to humour an old man.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have no choice, when you put it like that,” said the abbot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Reverend Sir—” began Rinpo, who felt that he did.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spoon was banged on the tray again. “Lu-Tze is a man of high reputation!” the abbot shouted. “I trust him implicitly to do the correct action! I just wish I could <em class="calibre9">blumblum </em>trust him to do what I <em class="calibre9">blumblum </em>want! I have forbidden him to go to Uberwald! Now do you wish me to forbid him <em class="calibre9">not </em>to go to Uberwald? <em class="calibre9">BIKKIT</em>! I have spoken! And now, will all you gentlemen be so good as to leave? I have urgent business to attend to.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze bowed and grabbed Lobsang's arm. “Come on, lad!” he whispered. “Let's bugger off quick before anyone works it out!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the way out they passed a lesser acolyte carrying a small potty with a pattern of bunny rabbits around it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's not easy, reincarnating,” said Lu-Tze, running down the corridor. “Now we've got to be out of here before someone gets any funny ideas. Grab your bag and bedroll!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But no one would countermand the abbot's orders, would they?” said Lobsang, as they skidded round a corner.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ha! It'll be his nap in ten minutes and if they give him a new toy when he wakes up he might end up being so busy banging square green pegs into round blue holes that he'll forget what he said,” said Lu-Tze. “Politics, lad. Too many idiots will start saying what they're sure the abbot would have <em class="calibre9">meant</em>. Off you go, now. I'll see you in the Garden of Five Surprises in one minute.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When Lobsang arrived Lu-Tze was carefully tying one of the bonsai mountains into a bamboo framework. He fastened the last knot and placed it in a bag over one shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Won't it get damaged?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a mountain. How can it get damaged?” Lu-Tze picked up his broom. “And we'll just drop in and have a chat with an old mate of mine before we leave, though. Maybe we'll pick up some stuff.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's going on, Sweeper?” said Lobsang, trailing after him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, it's like this, lad. Me and the abbot and the bloke we're going to see, we go back a long way. Things are a bit different now. The abbot can't just say, ‘Lu-Tze, you are an old rogue, it was you who put the idea of Uberwald into everyone's heads in the first place, but I see you're onto something, so off you go and follow your nose.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I thought he was the supreme ruler!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly! And it's very hard to get things done when you're a supreme ruler. There're too many people in the way, mucking things up. This way, the new lads can have fun running around Uberwald going ‘Hai!’ and <em class="calibre9">we</em>, my lad, will be heading for Ankh-Morpork. The abbot knows that. <em class="calibre9">Almost </em>knows that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How do you know the new clock is being built in Ankh Morpork?” said Lobsang, trailing behind Lu-Tze as he took a mossy, sunken path that led through rhododendron thickets to the monastery wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">know</em>. I'll tell you, the day someone pulls the plug out of the bottom of the universe, the chain will lead all the way to Ankh-Morpork and some bugger saying, ‘I just wanted to see what would happen.’ All roads lead to Ankh-Morpork.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought all roads led <em class="calibre9">away </em>from Ankh-Morpork.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not the way we're going. Ah, here we are.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze knocked on the door of a rough but large shed built right up against the wall. At the same moment there was an explosion within and someone—Lobsang corrected himself—<em class="calibre9">half </em>of someone tumbled very fast out of the unglazed window beside it and hit the path with bone-cracking force. Only when it stopped rolling did he realize that it was a wooden dummy in a monk's robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Qu's having fun, I see,” said Lu-Tze. He hadn't moved as the dummy had sailed past his ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The door burst open and a plump old monk looked out excitedly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Did you see that? Did you <em class="calibre9">see </em>that?” he said. “And that was with just one spoonful!” He nodded at them. “Oh, hello, Lu-Tze. I was expecting you. I've got some things ready.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Got what?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who's the boy?” said Qu, ushering them in.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The untutored child is called Lobsang,” said Lu-Tze, looking around the shed. There was a smoking circle on the stone floor, with drifts of blackened sand around it. “New toys, Qu?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exploding mandala,” said Qu happily, bustling forward. “Just sprinkle the special sand on a simple design anywhere you like, and the first enemy to walk on it—Bang, instant karma! <em class="calibre9">Don't touch that!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze reached across and snatched from Lobsang's inquisitive hands the begging bowl that he had just picked up from a table.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Remember Rule One,” he said, and hurled the bowl across the room. Hidden blades slid out as it spun, and the bowl buried itself in a beam.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That would take a man's head right off!” said Lobsang. And then they heard the faint ticking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…three, four, five…” said Qu. “Everybody duck… <em class="calibre9">Now!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze pushed Lobsang to the floor a moment before the bowl exploded. Metal fragments scythed overhead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I added just a little something extra since you last saw it,” said Qu proudly, as they got to their feet again. “A very versatile device. Plus, of course, you can use it to eat rice out of. Oh, and have you seen this?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He picked up a prayer drum. Both Lu-Tze and Lobsang took a step back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Qu twirled the drum a few times, and the weighted cords pattered against the skins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The cord can be instantly removed for a handy garotte,” he said, “and the drum itself can be removed—like so—to reveal this useful dagger.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Plus, of course, you can use it to pray with?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well spotted,” said Qu. “Quick boy. A prayer is always useful in the last resort. In fact we've been working on a very promising mantra incorporating sonic tones that have a particular effect on the human nervous syst—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think we need any of this stuff, Qu,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Qu sighed. “At least you could let us turn your broom into a secret weapon, Lu-Tze. I've shown you the plans—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is a secret weapon,” said Lu-Tze. “It's a broom.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How about the new yaks we've been breeding? At the touch of a rein their horns will instantly—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We want the spinners, Qu.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The monk suddenly looked guilty. “Spinners? What spinners?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze walked across the room and pressed a hand against part of the wall, which slid aside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“These spinners, Qu. Don't muck me about, we haven't got time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang saw what looked very much like two small Procrastinators, each one within a metal framework mounted on a board. There was a harness attached to each board.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You haven't told the abbot about them yet, have you?” said Lu-Tze, unhooking one of the things. “He'd put a stop to them if you did, you know that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't think <em class="calibre9">anyone </em>knew!” said Qu. “How did <em class="calibre9">you</em>–”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze grinned. “No one notices a sweeper,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're still very experimental!” said Qu, close to panic. “I <em class="calibre9">was </em>going to tell the abbot, of <em class="calibre9">course</em>, but I was waiting until I had something to demonstrate! And it would be terrible if they fell into the wrong hands!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then we'll see to it that they don't,” said Lu-Tze, examining the straps. “How're they powered now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Weights and ratchets were too unreliable,” said Qu. “I'm afraid I had to resort to… clockwork.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stiffened, and he glared at the monk. “<em class="calibre9">Clockwork</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only as a motive force, only as a motive force!” Qu protested. “There's really no other choice!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Too late now, it'll have to do,” said Lu-Tze, unhooking the other board and passing it across to Lobsang. “There you go, lad. With a bit of sacking round it it'll look just like a backpack.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Qu sighed. “They're portable Procrastinators. <em class="calibre9">Try </em>not to break them, please.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What will we need them for?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I hope you won't have to find out,” said Lu-Tze. “Thanks, Qu.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you sure you wouldn't prefer some time bombs?” said Qu hopefully. “Drop one on the floor and time will slow for—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thanks, but no.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The other monks were <em class="calibre9">fully </em>equipped,” said Qu.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But we're travelling light,” said Lu-Tze firmly. “We'll go out the back way, Qu, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The back way led to a narrow path and a small gate in the wall. Dismembered wooden dummies and patches of scorched rock indicated that Qu and his assistants often came this way. And then there was another path, beside one of the many icy streamlet's.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Qu means well,” said Lu-Tze, walking fast. “But if you listen to him you end up clanking when you walk and exploding when you sit down.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang ran to keep up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It'll take <em class="calibre9">weeks </em>to walk to Ankh-Morpork, Sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll slice our way there,” said Lu-Tze, and he stopped and turned. “You think you can do that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've done it hundreds of times—” Lobsang began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Back in Oi Dong, yes,” said Lu-Tze. “But there's all kinds of checks and safeguards in the valley. Oh, didn't you know that? Slicing in Oi Dong is <em class="calibre9">easy</em>, lad. It's different out there. The air tries to get in the way. Do it wrong and the air is a rock. You have to shape the slice around you so that you move like a fish in water. Know how to do that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We learned a bit of the theory, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Soto said you stopped time for yourself back in the city. The Stance of the Coyote, it's called. Very hard to do, and I don't reckon they teach it in the Thieves' Guild, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I suppose I was lucky, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. Keep it up. We'll have plenty of time for you to practise before we leave the snow. Get it right before you tread on grass, or kiss your feet goodbye.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">They called it slicing time</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">There is a way of playing certain musical instruments that is called “circular breathing”, devised to allow people to play the didgeridoo or the bagpipes without actually imploding or being sucked down the tube. “Slicing time” was very much the same, except time was substituted for air and it was a lot quieter. A trained monk could stretch a second further than an hour</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">But that wasn't enough. He'd be moving in a rigid world. He'd have to learn to see by echo light and hear by ghost sound and let time leach into his immediate universe. It wasn't hard, once he found the confidence; the sliced world could almost seem normal, apart from the colours</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was like walking in sunsets, although the sun was fixed high in the sky and barely moved. The world ahead shaded towards violet, and the world behind, when Lobsang looked round, was the shade of old blood. And it was lonely. But the worst of it, Lobsang realized, was the silence. There was noise, of a sort, but it was just a deep sizzle at the edge of hearing. His footsteps sounded strange and muffled, and the sound arrived in his ears out of sync with the tread of his feet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They reached the edge of the valley and stepped out of the perpetual springtime into the real world of the snows. Now the cold crept in, slowly, like a sadist's knife.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze strode on ahead, seemingly oblivious of it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Of course, that was one of the stories about him. Lu-Tze, it was said, would walk for miles during weather when the clouds themselves would freeze and crash out of the sky. Cold did not affect him, they said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And yet—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the stories Lu-Tze had been bigger, stronger… not a skinny little bald man who preferred not to fight.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stopped and turned. His outline blurred slightly, and Lobsang unwrapped himself from time. Colour came back into the world, and while the cold ceased to have the force of a drill it still struck hard.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to teach me, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If there's anything left that you don't know, wonder boy,” said Lu-Tze drily. “You're slicing well, I can see that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know how you can stand this cold!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, you don't know the secret?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it the Way of Mrs Cosmopilite that gives you such power?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze hitched up his robe and did a little dance in the snow, revealing skinny legs encased in thick, yellowing tubes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very good, very good,” he said. “She still sends me these double-knit combinations, silk on the inside, then three layers of wool, reinforced gussets and a couple of handy trapdoors. Very reasonably priced at six dollars a pair because I'm an old customer. For it is written, ‘Wrap up warm or you'll catch your death.’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's just a <em class="calibre9">trick</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze looked surprised. “What?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, I mean, it's all tricks, isn't it? Everyone thinks you're a great hero and… you don't fight, and they think you possess all kinds of strange knowledge and… and it's just… <em class="calibre9">tricking </em>people. Isn't it? Even the abbot? I thought you were going to teach me… things worth knowing…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've got her address, if that's what you want. If you mention my name—Oh. I see you don't mean that, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't want to be ungrateful I just thought—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You thought I should use mysterious powers derived from a lifetime of study just to keep my legs warm? Eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Debase the sacred teachings for the sake of my knees, you think?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If you put it like that—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then something made Lobsang look down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He was standing in six inches of snow. Lu-Tze was not. His sandals were standing in two puddles. The ice was melting away around his toes. His pink, warm toes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Toes, now, that's another matter,” said the sweeper. “Mrs Cosmopilite is a wizard with longjohns, but she can't turn a heel worth a damn.” Lobsang looked up into a wink. “Always remember Rule One, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze patted the shaken boy on the arm. “But you're doing well” he said. “Let's have a quiet sit down and a brew-up.” He pointed to some rocks, which at least offered some protection from the wind; snow had piled up against them in big white mounds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've got a question. Can you give me a straight answer?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll try, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">What the hell is going on</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze brushed the snow off a rock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh,” he said. “One of the <em class="calibre9">difficult </em>questions.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor had to admit it. When it came to getting weird things done, sane beat mad hands down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd been used to masters who, despite doing wonderful handstands on the edge of the mental catastrophe curve, couldn't put their own trousers on without a map. Like all Igors, he'd learned how to deal with them. In truth, it wasn't a difficult job (although sometimes you had to work the graveyard shift) and once you got them settled into their routine you could get on with your own work and they wouldn't bother you until the lightning rod needed raising.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It wasn't like that with Jeremy. He was truly a man you could set your watch by. Igor had never seen a life so organized, so slimmed down, so <em class="calibre9">timed</em>. He found himself thinking of his new master as the tick-tock man.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of Igors former masters had <em class="calibre9">made </em>a tick-tock man, all levers and gearwheels and cranks and clockwork. Instead of a brain, it had a long tape punched with holes. Instead of a heart, it had a big spring. Provided everything in the kitchen was very carefully positioned, the thing could sweep the floor and make a passable cup of tea. If everything <em class="calibre9">wasn't </em>carefully positioned, or if the ticking, clicking thing hit an unexpected bump, then it'd strip the plaster off the walls and make a furious cup of cat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then his master had conceived the idea of making the thing <em class="calibre9">live</em>, so that it could punch its own tapes and wind its own spring. Igor, who knew exactly when to follow instructions to the letter, dutifully rigged up the classic rising-table-and-lightning-rod arrangement on the evening of a really good storm. He didn't see exactly what happened thereafter, because he wasn't there when the lightning hit the clockwork. No, Igor was at a dead run halfway down the hill to the village, with all his possessions in a carpet bag. Even so, a white-hot cogwheel had whirred over his head and buried itself in a treetrunk.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Loyalty to a master was very important, but it took second place to loyalty to Igordom. If the world was going to be full of lurching servants, then they were damn well going to be called Igor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It seemed to this Igor that if you <em class="calibre9">could </em>make a tick-tock man live, he'd be like Jeremy. And Jeremy was ticking faster, as the clock neared completion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor didn't much like the clock. He was a <em class="calibre9">people </em>person. He preferred things that bled. And as the clock grew, with its shimmering crystal parts that didn't seem entirely all <em class="calibre9">here</em>, so Jeremy grew more absorbed and Igor grew more tense. There was definitely something new happening here, and while Igors were avid to learn new things there were limits. Igors did not believe in forbidden knowledge and “Things Man Was Not Meant to Know”, but obviously there were <em class="calibre9">some </em>things a man was not meant to know, such as what it felt like to have every single particle of your body sucked into a little hole, and that seemed to be one of the options available in the immediate future.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then there was Lady LeJean. She gave Igor the willies, and he was a man not usually subject to even the smallest willy. She wasn't a zombie and she wasn't a vampire, because she didn't smell like one. She didn't smell like anything. In Igor's experience, <em class="calibre9">everything </em>smelled like <em class="calibre9">something</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there was the other matter.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Her feet don't touch the ground, thur,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course they do,” said Jeremy, buffing up part of the mechanism with his sleeve. “She'll be here again in a minute and seventeen seconds. And I'm sure her feet will be touching the ground.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, <em class="calibre9">thometimeth </em>they do, thur. But you watch when thee goeth up or down a thtep, thur. Thee doethn't get it egthactly right, thur. You can jutht thee the thadow under her thoeth.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thoeth?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“On her feet, thur,” sighed Igor. The lisp could be a problem, and in truth any Igor could easily fix it, but it was part of being an Igor. You might as well stop limping.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Go and get ready by the door,” said Jeremy. “Floating in the air doesn't make you a bad person.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor shrugged. He was entertaining the idea that it didn't mean you were a person at all, and incidentally he was rather worried that Jeremy seemed to have dressed himself with a little more care this morning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd decided in these circumstances not to broach the subject of his hiring, but he had been working that one out. He'd been hired before her ladyship had engaged Jeremy to do this work? Well, all that showed was that she knew her man. But she'd hired him herself in Bad Schuschein. And he'd got himself onto the mail coach that very day. And it turned out that Lady LeJean had visited Jeremy on that day, too.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The only thing faster than the mail coach between Uberwald and Ankh-Morpork was magic, unless someone had found a way to travel by semaphore. And Lady LeJean hardly looked like a witch.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The shop's clocks were putting up a barrage of noise to signal the passing of seven o'clock when Igor opened the front door. It always Did<a href="#TOT_APF10" title="10. Not “Did” anything, just “Did”. Some things were Done, and some things were Not Done. And the things that were Done, Igors Did."><sup class="calibre10">10</sup></a> to anticipate the knock. That was another part of the Code of the Igors.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He wrenched it open.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Two pints, sir, lovely and fresh,” said Mr Soak, handing him the bottles. “And a day like this just says fresh cream, doesn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor glared at him, but took the bottles. “I prefer it when it'th going green,” he said haughtily. “Good day to you, Mr Thoak.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He shut the door.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It wasn't her?” said Jeremy, when he arrived back in the workshop.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It wath the milkman, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“She's twenty-five seconds late!” said Jeremy, looking concerned. “Do you think anything could have happened to her?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Real ladieth are often fathionably late, thur,” said Igor, putting the milk away. It was icy cold under his fingers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, I'm sure her ladyship is a real lady.” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wouldn't know about that, thur,” said Igor, who in fact had the aforesaid very strong doubts in that area. He walked back into the shop and took up position with his hand on the door handle just as the knock came.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean swept past Igor. The two trolls ignored him and took up their positions just inside the workshop. Igor put them down as hired rock, anyone's for two dollars a day plus walking-around money.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her ladyship was impressed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The big clock was nearing completion. It wasn't the squat, blocky thing that Igor's grandfather had told him about. Jeremy had, much to Igor's surprise—for there wasn't a scrap of decoration anywhere in the house—gone for the impressive look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Your grandfather helped to make the first one,” Jeremy had said. “So let's build a grandfather clock, eh?” And there it stood—a slim, long-case clock in crystal and spun glass, reflecting the light in worrying ways.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor had spent a fortune in the Street of Cunning Artificers. For enough money, you could buy <em class="calibre9">anything </em>in Ankh-Morpork, and that included people. He'd made sure that no crystal-cutter or glassworker had done enough of the work to give them any sort of clue about the finished clock, but he'd worried needlessly about that. Money could buy a lot of uninterest. Besides, who would believe you could measure time with crystals? Only in the workshop did it all come together.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor bustled around, polishing things, listening carefully as Jeremy showed off his creation.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—no <em class="calibre9">need </em>for any metal parts;” he was saying. “We've come up with a way of making the tamed lightning flow across glass, and we've found a workman who can make glass that bends slightly—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We”, Igor noticed. Well, that was always the way of it. “We” discovering things meant the master asking for them and Igor thinking them up. Anyway, the flow of lightning was a family passion. With sand and chemicals and a few secrets, you could make lightning sit up and beg.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean reached out with a gloved hand and touched the side of the clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is the divider mechanism—” Jeremy began, picking up a crystalline array from the workbench.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But her ladyship was still staring up at the clock. “You've given it a face and hands,” she said. “Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, it will function very well in the measurement of traditional time,” said Jeremy. “Glass gears throughout, of course. In theory it will never need adjusting. It will take its time from the universal tick.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. You found it, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The time it takes the smallest possible thing that <em class="calibre9">can </em>happen <em class="calibre9">to </em>happen. I know it exists.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She looked almost impressed. “But the clock is still unfinished.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There is a certain amount of trial and error,” said Jeremy. “But we will do it. Igor says there will be a big storm on Monday. That should provide the power, he says. And then,” Jeremy's face lit up with a smile, “I see no reason why every clock in the world shouldn't say precisely the same time!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean glanced at Igor, who bustled with renewed haste.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The servant is satisfactory?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, he grumbles a bit. But he has got a good heart. And a spare, apparently. He is amazingly skilled in all crafts, too.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Igors generally are,” said the lady distantly. “They seem to have mastered the art of inheriting talents.” She snapped her fingers and one of the trolls stepped forward and produced a couple of bags.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Gold and invar,” she said. “As promised.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah, but invar will be worthless when we've finished the clock,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're sorry? You want more gold?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, no! You have been very generous.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Right</em>, thought Igor, dusting the workbench vigorously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Until next time, then,” said Lady LeJean. The trolls were already turning towards the door.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'll be here for the start?” said Jeremy, as Igor hurried into the hall to open the front door because, whatever he thought about her ladyship, there was such a thing as tradition.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Possibly. But we have every confidence in you, Jeremy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Um…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor stiffened. He hadn't heard that tone in Jeremy's voice before. In the voice of a master, it was a <em class="calibre9">bad </em>tone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy took a deep, nervous breath, as if contemplating some minute and difficult piece of clockwork that would, without tremendous care, unwind catastrophically and spray cogwheels across the floor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Um… I was wondering, um, your ladyship, um… perhaps, um, you would like to take dinner with me, um, tonight, um…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy smiled. Igor had seen a better smile on a corpse.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean's expression flickered. It really did. It seemed to Igor to go from one expression to another as if they were a series of still pictures, with no perceptible movement of the features between each one. It went from her usual blankness to sudden thoughtfulness and then all the way to amazement. And then, to Igor's own astonishment, it began to blush.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why, Mr Jeremy, I… I don't know what to say,” her ladyship stammered, her icy composure turning into a warm puddle. “I really… I don't know… perhaps some other time? I do have an important engagement, so glad to have met you, I must be going. Goodbye.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor stood stiffly to attention, as upright as the average Igor could manage, and <em class="calibre9">almost </em>shut the door behind her ladyship as she hurried out of the building down the steps.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She ended up, just for a moment, half an inch above the street. It was <em class="calibre9">only </em>for a moment, and then she drifted downwards. No one except Igor, glaring balefully through the crack between door and frame, could possibly have noticed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He darted back into the workshop. Jeremy still stood transfixed, blushing as pinkly as her ladyship had done.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll jutht be nipping out to get that new glathwork for the multiplier, thur,” Igor said quickly. “It thould be done by now. Yeth?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy spun on his heel and marched very quickly over to the workbench.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You do that, Igor. Thank you,” he said, his voice slightly muffled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean's party were down the street when Igor slipped out and moved quickly into the shadows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the crossroad her ladyship waved one hand vaguely and the trolls headed off by themselves. Igor stayed with her. For all the trademark limp, Igors could move fast when they had to. They often had to, when the mob hit the windmill.<a href="#TOT_APF11" title="11. Igors were loyal, but they were not stupid. A job was a job. When an employer had no further use for your services, for example because he'd just been staked through the heart by a crowd of angry villagers, it was time to move on before they decided that you ought to be on the next stake. An Igor soon learned a secret way out of any castle and where to stash an overnight bag. In the words of one of the founding Igors: “We belong dead? Excuthe me? Where doeth it thay ‘we’?”"><sup class="calibre10">11</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Out in the open, he could see more wrong things. She didn't move quite right. It was as though she was controlling her body, rather than letting it control itself. That's what humans did. Even zombies got the hang of things after a while. The effect was subtle, but Igors had very good eyesight. She moved like someone unused to wearing skin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The quarry headed down a narrow street, and Igor half hoped that some of the Thieves' Guild were around. He'd very much like to see what happened if one of them gave her the tap on the noggin that was their prelude to negotiations. One had tried it with Igor yesterday, and if the man had been surprised at the metallic clang he'd been astonished to have his arm grabbed and broken with anatomical exactitude.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In fact, she turned into an alleyway between a couple of the buildings.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor hesitated. Letting yourself be outlined in the daylight at the mouth of an alley was item one on the local checklist of death. But, on the other hand, he wasn't actually doing anything wrong, was he? And she didn't look armed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no sound of footsteps in the alley. He waited a moment and stuck his head round the corner.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no sign of Lady LeJean. There was also no way out of the alley—it was a dead end, full of rubbish.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But there was a fading grey shape in the air, which vanished even as he stared. It was a hooded robe, grey as fog. It merged into the general gloom and disappeared.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd turned into an alleyway, and then she'd turned into… something else.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor felt his hands twitch.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Individual Igors might have their particular specialities, but they were all expert surgeons and had an inbuilt desire not to see anybody wasted. Up in the mountains, where most of the employment was for woodchoppers and miners, having an Igor living locally was considered very fortunate. There was always the risk of an axe bouncing or a sawblade running wild, and then a man was <em class="calibre9">glad </em>to have an Igor around who could lend a hand—or even an entire arm, if you were lucky.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And while they practised their skills freely and generously in the community, the Igors were even more careful to use them amongst themselves. Magnificent eyesight, a stout pair of lungs, a powerful digestive system… It was terrible to think of such wonderful workmanship going to the worms. So they made sure it didn't. They kept it in the family.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor really <em class="calibre9">did </em>have his grandfather's hands. And now they were bunching into fists, all by themselves.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A very small kettle burned on a fire of wood shavings and dried yak dung.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was… a long time ago,” said Lu-Tze. “Exactly when doesn't matter, 'cos of what happened. In fact asking exactly ‘when’ doesn't make any sense any more. It depends where you are. In some places it was hundreds of years ago. Some other places… well, maybe it hasn't happened yet. There was this man in Uberwald. Invented a clock. An <em class="calibre9">amazing </em>clock. It measured the tick of the universe. Know what that is?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me neither. The abbot's your man for that kind of stuff. Lemme see… okay… think of the smallest amount of time that you can. Really small. So tiny that a second would be like a billion years. Got that? Well, the cosmic quantum tick—that's what the abbot calls it—the cosmic quantum tick is much smaller than that. It's the time it takes to go from <em class="calibre9">now </em>to <em class="calibre9">then</em>. The time it takes an atom to think of wobbling. It's—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's the time it takes for the smallest thing that's possible <em class="calibre9">to </em>happen to happen?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly. Well done,” said Lu-Tze. He took a deep breath. “It's also the time it takes for the whole universe to be destroyed in the past and rebuilt in the future. Don't look at me like that—that's what the <em class="calibre9">abbot </em>said.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Has it been happening while we've been talking?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Millions of times. An oodleplex of times, probably.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How many's that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's one of the abbot's words. It means more numbers than you can imagine in a yonk.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's a yonk?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A very long time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And we don't feel it? The universe is <em class="calibre9">destroyed </em>and we don't feel it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They say not. The first time it was explained to me I got a bit jumpy, but it's far too quick for us to notice.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stared at the snow for a while. Then he said, “All right. Go on.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Someone in Uberwald built this clock out of glass. Powered by lightning, as I recall. It somehow got down to a level where it could tick with the universe.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why did he want to do that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Listen, he lived in a big old castle on a crag in Uberwald. People like that don't need a reason apart from ‘because I can’. They have a nightmare and try to make it happen.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But, look, you can't make a clock like that, because it's inside the universe, so it'll… get rebuilt when the universe does, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze looked impressed, and said so. “I'm impressed,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It'd be like opening a box with the crowbar that's inside.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The abbot believes that part of the clock was outside, though.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You can't have something <em class="calibre9">outside </em>the—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Tell that to a man who has been working on the problem for nine lifetimes,” said Lu-Tze. “You want to hear the rest of the story?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">So</em>… we were spread pretty thin in those days, but there was this young sweeper—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You,” said Lobsang. “This is going to be you, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, yes,” said Lu-Tze testily. “I was sent to Uberwald. History hadn't diverged much in those days, and we knew something big was going to happen around Bad Schuschein. I must have spent weeks looking. You know how many remote castles there are along the gorges? You can't <em class="calibre9">move </em>for remote castles!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's why you didn't find the right one in time,” said Lobsang. “I remember what you told the abbot.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I was just down in the valley when the lightning struck the tower,” said Lu-Tze. “You know it is written, ‘Big events always cast their shadows.’ But I couldn't detect <em class="calibre9">where </em>it was happening until too late. A half-mile sprint uphill faster than a lightning bolt… No one could do that. Nearly made it, though—I was actually through the door when it all went to hell!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No point in blaming yourself, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but you know how it is—you keep thinking ‘If only I'd got up earlier, or had gone a different way…’” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And the clock struck,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. It <em class="calibre9">stuck</em>. I told you part of it was outside the universe. It wouldn't go with the flow. It was trying to count the tick, not move with it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the universe is huge! It can't be stopped by a piece of clock work!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze flicked the end of his cigarette into the fire.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The abbot says the size wouldn't make any difference at all,” he said. “Look, it's taken him nine lifetimes to know what he knows, so it's not our fault if we can't understand it, is it? History shattered. It was the only thing that could give. Very strange event. There were cracks left all over the place. The… oh, I can't remember the words… the fastenings that tell bits of the past which bits of the present they belong to, they were flapping allover the place. Some got lost for ever.” Lu-Tze stared into the dying flames. “We stitched it up as best we could,” he added. “Up and down history. Filling up holes with bits of time taken from somewhere else. It's a patchwork, really.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Didn't people notice?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why should they? Once we'd done it, it had always been like that. You'd be amazed at what we got away with. F'r instance—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sure they spot it somehow.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze gave Lobsang one of his sidelong glances. “Funny you should say that. I've always wondered about it. People say things like ‘Where did the time go?’ and ‘It seems like only yesterday.’ We had to do it, anyway. And it's healed up very nicely.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But people would look in the history books and see—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Words, lad. That's all. Anyway, people have been messing around with time ever since there <em class="calibre9">were </em>people. Wasting it, killing it, sparing it, making it up. And they <em class="calibre9">do </em>it. People's heads were <em class="calibre9">made </em>to play with time. Just like we do, except we're better trained and have a few extra skills. And we've spent centuries working to bring it all back in line. You watch the Procrastinators even on a quiet day. Moving time, stretching it here, compressing it there… it's a big job. I'm not going to see it smashed a second time. A second time, there won't be enough left to repair.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stared at the embers. “Funny thing,” he said. “Wen himself had some very funny ideas about time, come the finish. Wrote some very strange stuff. He reckoned Time was alive. He said it acted like a living thing, anyway. Very strange ideas indeed. He said he'd <em class="calibre9">met </em>Time, and she was a woman. To him, anyway. Everyone says that was just a very complicated metaphor, and maybe I was simply hit on the head or something, but on that day I looked at the glass clock just as it exploded and—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stood up and grabbed his broom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Best foot forward, lad. Another two or three seconds and we'll be down in Bong Phut.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What were you going to say?” said Lobsang, hurrying to his feet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, just an old man rambling,” said Lu-Tze. “The mind wanders a bit when you get to over seven hundred. Let's get moving.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, lad?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why are we carrying spinners on our backs?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All in good time, lad. I hope.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're carrying time, right? If time stops, we can keep going? Like… divers?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Full marks.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Another question?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Time is a ‘she’? None of the teachers have mentioned it and I don't recall anything in the scrolls.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't you think about that. Wen wrote… well, the Secret Scroll, it's called. They keep it in a locked room. Only the abbots and the most senior monks ever get to see it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang couldn't let that one pass. “So how did you—?” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, you wouldn't expect men like that to do the sweeping up in there, would you?” said Lu-Tze. “Terribly dusty, it got.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What was it about?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't read much of it. Didn't feel it was right,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You? What was it about, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was a love poem. And it was a good one…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's image blurred as he sliced time. Then it faded and vanished. A line of footprints appeared across the snowfield. Lobsang wrapped time around himself and followed. And a memory came from nowhere at all: <em class="calibre9">Wen was right</em>.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There were lots of places like the warehouse. There always are, in every old city, no matter how valuable the building land is. Sometimes, space just gets lost.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A workshop is built, and then another beside it. Factories and storerooms and sheds and temporary lean-tos crawl towards one another, meet and merge. Spaces between outside walls are roofed with tar paper. Odd-shaped bits of ground are colonized by nailing up a bit of wall and cutting a doorway. Old doorways are masked by piles of lumber or new tool racks. The old men who know what was where move on and die, just like the flies who punctuate the thick cobwebs on the grubby windows. Young men, in this noisome world of whirring lathes and paint shops and cluttered workbenches, don't have time to explore.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And so there were spaces like this, a small warehouse with a crusted skylight that no fewer than four factory owners thought was owned by one of the other three, when they thought about it at all. In fact each of them owned one wall, and certainly no one recalled who roofed the space. Beyond the walls on all four sides men and dwarfs bent iron, sawed planks, made string and turned screws. But in here was a silence known only to rats.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air moved, for the first time in years. Dust balls rolled across the floor. Little motes sparkled and spun in the light that forced its way down from the roof. In the surrounding area, invisible and subtle, matter began to move. It came from workmen's sandwiches and gutter dirt and pigeon feathers, an atom here, a molecule there, and streamed unheeded into the centre of the space.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It spiralled. Eventually it became, after passing through some strange, ancient and horrible shapes, Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She staggered, but managed to stay upright.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Other Auditors also appeared and, as they did so, it seemed that they had never really <em class="calibre9">not </em>been there. The dead greyness of the light merely took on shapes; they emerged like ships from a fog. You stared at the fog, and suddenly part of the fog was hull that had been there all along, and now there was nothing for it but to race for the lifeboats…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean said: “I cannot keep doing this. It is too painful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Ah… can you tell us what pain is like? We have often wondered</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. No, I don't think I can. It is… a body thing. It is not pleasant. From now on, I will retain the body.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">That could be dangerous</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean shrugged.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We have been through that before. It's only a matter of appearance,” she said. “And it is remarkable how much easier it is to deal with humans in this form.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">You <strong class="calibre12">shrugged</strong>. And you are talking with your <strong class="calibre12">mouth</strong>. A hole for food and air</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. It is remarkable, isn't it.” Lady LeJean's body found an old crate, pulled it over, and sat on it. She hardly had to think about muscle movements at all!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">You aren't <strong class="calibre12">eating</strong>, are you?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“As yet, no.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">As yet? That raises the whole dreadful subject of</em>… <em class="calibre9">orifices</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">And how did you <strong class="calibre12">learn</strong> to shrug?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It comes with the body,” said her ladyship. “We never realized this, did we? Most of the things it does it appears to do automatically. Standing upright takes no effort whatsoever. The whole business gets easier every time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The body shifted position slightly, and crossed its legs. Amazing, she thought. It did it to be comfortable. I didn't have to think about it at all. We never guessed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">There will be questions</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors <em class="calibre9">hated </em>questions. They hated them almost as much as they hated decisions, and they hated decisions almost as much as they hated the idea of the individual personality. But what they hated most was things moving around randomly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Believe me, everything will be fine,” said Lady LeJean. “We will not be breaking any of the rules, after all. All that will happen is that time will stop. Everything thereafter will be neat. Alive, but not moving. Tidy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">And we can get the filing finished</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly,” said Lady LeJean. “And he <em class="calibre9">wants </em>to do it. That is the strange thing. He hardly thinks about the consequences.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Splendid</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was one of those pauses when no one is quite ready to speak yet. And then…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Tell us</em>… <em class="calibre9">What is it like?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is what like?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Being insane. Being human</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Strange. Disorganized. Several levels of thinking go on at once. There are… things we have no word for. For example, the idea of eating seems now to have a… an attraction. The body tells me this.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Attraction? As in gravity?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ye-es. One is drawn towards food.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Food in large masses?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Even in small amounts.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">But eating is simply a function. What is the… attraction of performing a function? Surely the knowledge that it is necessary for continued survival is sufficient?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I cannot say,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One Auditor said, <em class="calibre9">You persist in using a personal pronoun</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And one added, <em class="calibre9">And you have not died! To be an individual is to live, and to live is to die!</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I know. But it is essential for humans to use the personal pronoun. It divides the universe into two parts. The darkness behind the eyes, where the little voice is, and everything else. It is… a horrible feeling. It is like being… questioned, all the time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">What is the little voice?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sometimes thinking is like talking to another person, but that person is also you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She could tell this disturbed the other Auditors. “I do not wish to continue in this way any longer than necessary,” she added. And realized that she had lied.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">We do not blame you</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean nodded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors could see into human minds. They could see the pop and sizzle of the thoughts. But they could not read them. They could see the energies flow from node to node, they could see the brain glittering like a Hogswatch decoration. What they couldn't see was what was <em class="calibre9">happening</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So they'd built one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was the logical thing to do. They'd used human agents before, because early on they'd worked out that there were many, many humans who would do <em class="calibre9">anything </em>for sufficient gold. This was puzzling, because gold did not seem to the Auditors to hold any significant value for a human body—it <em class="calibre9">needed </em>iron and copper and zinc, but only the most minute traces of gold. Therefore, they'd reasoned, this was further evidence that the humans who required it were flawed, and this was why attempts to make use of them were doomed. But <em class="calibre9">why </em>were they flawed?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Building a human being was easy; the Auditors knew <em class="calibre9">exactly </em>how to move matter around. The trouble was that the result didn't do anything but lie there and, eventually, decompose. This was annoying, since human beings, without any special training or education, seemed to be able to make working replicas quite easily.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then they learned that they could make a human body which worked if an Auditor was inside it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were, of course, huge risks. Death was one of them. The Auditors avoided death by never going so far as to get a life. They strove to be as indistinguishable as hydrogen atoms, and with none of the latter's <em class="calibre9">joie de vivre</em>. Some luckless Auditor might be risking death by “operating” the body. But lengthy consultation decided that if the <em class="calibre9">driver </em>took care, and liaised at all times with the rest of the Auditors, this risk was minimal and worth taking, considering the goal.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They built a woman. It was a logical choice. After all, while men wielded more obvious power than women, they often did so at the expense of personal danger, and no Auditor liked the prospect of personal danger. Beautiful women often achieved great things, on the other hand, merely by smiling at powerful men.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The whole subject of “beauty” caused the Auditors a lot of difficulty. It made no sense at a molecular level. But research turned up the fact that the woman in the picture <em class="calibre9">Woman Holding Ferret </em>by Leonard of Quirm was considered the epitome of beauty, and so they'd based Lady LeJean on that. They had made changes, of course. The face in the picture was asymmetrical and full of minor flaws, which they had carefully removed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The result would have been successful beyond the Auditors' wildest dreams, had they ever dreamed. Now that they had their stalking horse, their <em class="calibre9">reliable </em>human, anything was possible. They were learning fast, or at least collecting data, which they considered to be the same as learning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So was Lady LeJean. She had been a human for two weeks, two astonishing, shocking weeks. Whoever would have guessed that a brain operated like this? Or that colours had a meaning that went way, way beyond spectral analysis? How could she even <em class="calibre9">begin </em>to describe the blueness of blue? Or how much thinking the brain did all by itself? It was terrifying. Half the time her thoughts seemed not to be her own.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She had been quite surprised to find that she did not want to tell the other Auditors this. She did not want to tell them a lot of things. And she didn't <em class="calibre9">have </em>to!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She had <em class="calibre9">power</em>. Oh, over Jeremy, that was not in question and was now, she had to admit, rather worrying. It was causing her body to do things by itself, like blush. But she had power over the other Auditors, too. She made them nervous.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Of course, she wanted the project to work. It was their goal. A tidy and predictable universe, where everything stayed in its place. If Auditors dreamed, this would be another dream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Except… except…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The young man had smiled at her in a nervous, worrying way, and the universe was turning out to be a lot more chaotic than even the Auditors had ever suspected.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A lot of the chaos was happening inside Lady LeJean's head.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze and Lobsang passed through Bong Phut and Long Nap like ghosts in twilight. People and animals were blueish statues and were not, said Lu-Tze, to be touched in any circumstances.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze restocked his travel bag with food from some of the houses, making sure to leave little copper tokens in their place.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It means we're obliged to them,” he said, filling Lobsang's bag as well. “The next monk through here might have to give someone a minute or two.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A minute or two isn't much.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“For a dying woman to say goodbye to her children, it's a lifetime,” said Lu-Tze. “Is it not written, ‘Every second counts’? Let's go.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm <em class="calibre9">tired</em>, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I did say every second counts.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But everybody has to sleep!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but not yet,” Lu-Tze insisted. “We can rest in the caves down at Songset. Can't fold time while you're asleep, see?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can't we use the spinners?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In theory, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In theory? They could wind out time for us. We'd only sleep for a few seconds—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're for emergencies only,” said Lu-Tze bluntly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How do you define an emergency, Sweeper?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An emergency is when I decide it's time to use a clockwork spinner designed by Qu, wonder boy. A lifebelt's for saving your life. That's when I'll trust an uncalibrated, unblessed spinner powered by springs. When I <em class="calibre9">have </em>to. I know Qu says—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang blinked and shook his head. Lu-Tze grabbed his arm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You felt something again?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ugh… like having a tooth out in my brain,” said Lobsang, rubbing his head. He pointed. “It came from over there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A <em class="calibre9">pain </em>came from over there?” said Lu-Tze. He glared at the boy. “But we've never found a way of detecting which <em class="calibre9">way</em>–”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stopped and rummaged in his sack. Then he used the sack to sweep snow off a flat boulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll see what—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Glass house</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">This time Lobsang could concentrate on the tones that filled the air. Wet finger on a wineglass? Well, you could start there. But the finger would have to be the finger of a god, on the glass of some celestial sphere. And the wonderful, complex, shifting tones did not simply fill the air, they were the air</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">The moving blur beyond the walls was getting closer now. It was just beyond the closest wall, then it found the open doorway… and vanished</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Something was behind Lobsang</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">He turned. There was nothing there that he could see, but he felt movement and, for just a moment, something warm brushed his cheek</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—the sand says,” said Lu-Tze, tipping the contents of a small bag onto the rock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The coloured grains bounced and spread. They did not have the sensitivity of the Mandala itself, but there was a blue bloom in the chaos.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He gave Lobsang a sharp look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's been <em class="calibre9">proved </em>that no one can do what you just did,” he said. “We've never found <em class="calibre9">any </em>way of detecting where a disturbance in time is actually being caused.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, sorry.” Lobsang raised a hand to his cheek. It was damp. “Er, what did I do?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It takes a huge—” Lu-Tze stopped. “Ankh-Morpork's that way,” he said. “Did you <em class="calibre9">know </em>that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No! Anyway, <em class="calibre9">you </em>said you had a feeling things would happen in Ankh-Morpork!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but I've had a lifetime of experience and cynicism!” Lu-Tze scooped the sand back into its bag. “You're just <em class="calibre9">gifted</em>. Come on.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Four more seconds, sliced thinly, took them below the snowline, into scree slopes that slid under their feet and then through alder forests not much taller than themselves. And it was there they met the hunters, gathered round in a wide circle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The men did not pay them much attention. Monks were commonplace in these parts. The leader, or at least the one who was shouting, and this is usually the leader, looked up and waved them past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stopped, though, and looked amiably at the thing in the centre of the circle. It looked back at him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good catch,” he said. “What're you going to do now, boys?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it any business of yours?” said the leader.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, no, just asking,” said Lu-Tze. “You boys up from the lowlands, yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah. You'd be amazed at what you can get for catching one of these.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Lu-Tze. “You <em class="calibre9">would </em>be amazed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked at the hunters. There were more than a dozen of them, all heavily armed and watching Lu-Tze carefully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nine hundred dollars for a good pelt and another thousand for the feet,” said their leader.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That much, eh?” said Lu-Tze. “That's a lot of money for a pair of feet.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's 'cos they're big feet,” said the hunter. “And you know what they say about men with big feet, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They need bigger shoes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah, right,” said the hunter, grinning. “Load of nonsense, really, but there's rich old boys with young wives over on the Counterweight Continent who'll pay a fortune for a powdered yeti foot.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And there was me thinking they're a protected species,” said Lu-Tze, leaning his broom against a tree.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're only a kind of troll. Who's going to protect them out here?” said the hunter. Behind him, the local guides, who <em class="calibre9">did </em>know Rule One, turned and ran.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh?” said the hunter, and this time the grin was nasty. “You don't even have a weapon.” He turned to look at the fleeing guides. “You're one of the weird monks from up in the valleys, aren't you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right,” said Lu-Tze. “Small smiling, weird monk. Totally unarmed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And there's fifteen of us,” said the hunter. “<em class="calibre9">Well </em>armed, as you can see.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's very important that you are all heavily armed,” said Lu-Tze, pulling his sleeves out of the way. “It makes it fairer.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He rubbed his hands together. No one seemed inclined to retreat. “Er, any of you boys heard of any rules?” he said, after a while.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Rules?” said one of the hunters. “What rules?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, you know,” said Lu-Tze. “Rules like… Rule Two, say, or Rule Twenty-seven. Any kind of rules of that sort of description.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The leading hunter frowned. “What in damnation are you talking about, mister?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, not so much a ‘mister’ as a small rather knowing, elderly, entirely unarmed, weird monk,” said Lu-Tze. “I'm just wondering if there is anything about this situation that makes you, you know… slightly nervous?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean, us being well armed and outnumbering you, and you backing away like that?” said one of the hunters.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Yes,” said Lu-Tze. “Perhaps we're up against a cultural thing here. I know, how about… this?” He stood on one leg, wobbling a little, and raised both hands. “Ai! Hai-eee! Ho? Ye-hi? No? Anyone?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a certain amount of bewilderment amongst the hunters.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it a book?” said one who was slightly intellectual. “How many words?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What I'm trying to find out here,” said Lu-Tze, “is whether you have any idea what happens when a lot of big armed men try to attack a small, elderly, <em class="calibre9">unarmed </em>monk?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To the best of my knowledge,” said the intellectual of the group, “he turns out to be a very unlucky monk.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze shrugged. “Oh, well,” he said, “then we'll just have to try it the hard way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A blur in the air hit the intellectual on the back of the neck. The leader stirred to step forward, and learned too late that his boot laces were tied together. Men reached for knives that were no longer in sheaths, for swords that were inexplicably leaning against a tree on the far side of the clearing. Legs were swept from underneath them, invisible elbows connected with soft parts of their bodies. Blows rained out of empty air. Those who fell down learned to stay that way. A raised head <em class="calibre9">hurt</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The group was reduced to men lying humbly on the ground, groaning gently. It was then that they heard a low, rhythmic sound.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti was clapping. It had to be a slow handclap, because of the creature's long arms. But when the hands met, they'd come a long way and were glad to see one another. They echoed around the mountains.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze reached down and raised the leader's chin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If you have enjoyed this afternoon, please tell your friends,” he said. “Tell them to remember Rule One.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He let the chin go, and walked across to the yeti and bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Shall I release you, sir, or would you like to do it yourself?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti stood up, looked down at the cruel iron trap around one leg, and concentrated for a moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the <em class="calibre9">end </em>of the moment, the yeti was a little way from the trap, which was still set and almost hidden in leaves.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done,” said Lu-Tze. “Methodical. And very smooth. Headed down to the lowlands?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti had to bend double to bring its long face close to Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yaas,” it said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do you want to do with these people?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti looked round at the cowering hunters.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It bein' daark soon,” he said. “No guides noaw.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They've got torches,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ha. Ha,” said the yeti, and it said it, rather than laughed. “Dat's <em class="calibre9">good</em>. Torches show up aat night.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! Yes. Can you give us a lift? It's really important.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You and daat whizzin' kid I seein' there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A patch of grey air at the edge of the clearing became Lobsang, out of breath. He dropped the broken branch he'd been holding.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The lad is called Lobsang. I'm training him up,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Looks like you gotta hurry before you runnin' out of things he don't knoow,” said the yeti. “Ha. Ha.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper, what were you—” Lobsang began, hurrying forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze put his finger to his lips. “Not in front of our fallen friends,” he said. “I'm looking for Rule One to become a lot better respected in these parts as a result of this day's work.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I had to do all the—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We must be going,” said Lu-Tze, waving him into silence. “I reckon we can snooze quite happily while our friend here carries us.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang glanced up at the yeti, and then back at Lu-Tze. And then back to the yeti. It was <em class="calibre9">tall</em>. In some ways it was like the trolls he'd met in the city, but rolled out thin. It was more than twice as high as he was, and most of the extra height was skinny legs and arms. The body was a ball of fur, and the feet were indeed huge.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If he could've got out of the trap at any—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">You </em>are the apprentice, right?” said Lu-Tze. “<em class="calibre9">Me</em>, I'm the master? I'm sure I wrote that down somewhere…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you said you weren't going to say any of those know-it-all—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Remember Rule One! Oh, and pick up one of those swords. We'll need it in a minute. Okay, yer honour…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti picked them up gently and firmly, cradled them in the crook of each arm, and strode away through the snow and trees.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Snug, eh?” said Lu-Tze after a while. “Their wool is spun out of rock in some way, but it's pretty comfy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no answer from the other arm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I spent some time with the yetis,” said Lu-Tze. “Amazing people. They taught me a thing or two. Valuable stuff. For is it not written, ‘We live and learn’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Silence, a kind of sullen, <em class="calibre9">deliberate </em>silence, reigned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'd think myself lucky if I was a boy your age actually being carried by an actual yeti. A lot of people back in the valley have never even seen one. Mind you, they don't come that close to settlements any more. Not since that rumour about their feet got around.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze got the feeling that he was taking part in a dialogue of one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Something you want to say, is there?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, as a matter of fact, yes, there <em class="calibre9">is</em>, actually,” said Lobsang. “You let me do all the work back there! You weren't going to do <em class="calibre9">anything</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I was making sure I had their full attention,” said Lu-Tze smoothly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So that <em class="calibre9">you </em>didn't have their full attention. I had every confidence in you, of course. A good master gives the pupil an opportunity to demonstrate his skills.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And what would you have done if I hadn't been here, pray?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, probably,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I expect I would have found some way to use their stupidity against them,” said Lu-Tze. “There generally is one. Is there a problem here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, I just… I thought… well, I just thought you'd be teaching me more, that's all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm teaching you things all the time,” said Lu-Tze. “You might not be learning them, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I <em class="calibre9">see,</em>” said Lobsang. “Very smug. Are you going to <em class="calibre9">try </em>to teach me about this yeti, then, and why you made me bring a sword?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'll need the sword to learn about yetis,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In a few minutes we'll find a nice place to stop and you can cut his head off. Is that all right by you, sir?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yaas. Sure,” said the yeti.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">In the Second Scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised </em>a story is written concerning one day when the apprentice Clodpool, in a rebellious mood, approached Wen and spake thusly:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Master, what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen considered this for some time, and at last said: “A fish!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And Clodpool went away, satisfied.</div>

      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Code of the Igors was very strict.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Never Contradict: it was no part of an Igor's job to say things like “No, thur, that'th an artery.” The marthter was always right.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Never Complain: an Igor would never say “But that'th a thouthand mileth away!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Never Make Personal Remarks: no Igor would dream of saying anything like “I thould have thomething done about that laugh, if I wath you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And never, ever Ask Questions. Admittedly, Igor knew, that meant never ask BIG questions. “Would thur like a cup of tea around now?” was fine, but “What do you need a hundred virginth for?” or “Where do you ecthpect me to find a brain at thith time of night?” was not. An Igor stood for loyal, dependable, discreet service with a smile, or at least a sort of lopsided grin, or possibly just a curved scar in the right place.<a href="#TOT_APF12" title="12. And it has to be said that there was nothing intrinsically evil about Igors themselves. They just didn't pass judgement on other people. Admittedly, that was because if you worked for werewolves and vampires and people who looked on surgery as modern art rather than science, passing judgement would mean you'd never have time to get anything done."><sup class="calibre10">12</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">And, therefore, Igor was getting worried. Things were wrong, and when an Igor thinks that, they are <em class="calibre9">really </em>wrong. Great difficulty lay in getting this across to Jeremy without breaking the Code, though. Igor was increasingly ill at ease with someone so clearly stark, staring sane. Nevertheless, he tried.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Her ladythip will be along <em class="calibre9">again </em>thith morning,” he said, as they watched yet another crystal grow in its solution. And I know you know that, he thought, because you've smoothed your hair down with soap and put on a clean shirt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Jeremy. “I wish we had better progress to report. However, I'm sure we're nearly there now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, that'th very thtrange, ithn't it,” said Igor, seizing the opening.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Strange, you say?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Call me Mithter Thilly, thur, but it theemth to me that we're alwayth on the point of thuctheth when her ladythip payth uth a vithit, but when thee'th gone we ecthperienth new difficultieth.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you suggesting, Igor?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me, thur? I'm not a thuggethtive perthon, thur. But latht time part of the divider array had cracked.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know I think that was because of dimensional instability!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Yeth</em>, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why are you giving me that funny look, Igor?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor shrugged. That is, one shoulder was momentarily as high as the other one. “Goeth with the fathe, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“She'd hardly pay us so handsomely and then sabotage the project, would she? Why would she do that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor hesitated. He had his back right up against the Code now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am thtill wondering if thee ith all thee theemth, thur.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry? I didn't catch that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wonder if we can trutht her, thur,” said Igor patiently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, go and calibrate the complexity resonator, will you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Grumbling, Igor obeyed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The second time Igor'd followed their benefactor she'd gone to a hotel. Next day she'd headed for a large house in Kings Way, where she'd been met by an oily man who'd made a great play of presenting her with a key. Igor had followed the oleaginous man back to his office in a nearby street where—because there are few things that are kept from a man with a face full of stitches—he'd learned that she'd just bought the lease for a very large bar of gold.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After that, Igor had resorted to an ancient Ankh-Morpork tradition and paid someone to follow her ladyship. There was enough gold in the workshop, heavens knew, and the master took no interest in it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean went to the opera. Lady LeJean went to art galleries. Lady LeJean was living life to the fullest. Except that Lady LeJean, as far as Igor could determine, never visited restaurants and had no food delivered to the house.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean was up to something. Igor could spot this easily. Lady LeJean also did not appear in <em class="calibre9">Twurp's Peerage </em>or the <em class="calibre9">Almanack de Gothic </em>or any of the other reference books Igor had checked as a matter of course, which meant that she had something to hide. Of course, he had worked for masters who occasionally had a great deal to hide, sometimes in deep holes at midnight. But this situation was morally different for two reasons. Her ladyship wasn't his master, Jeremy was, and that was where his loyalty lay. And Igor had <em class="calibre9">decided </em>it was morally different.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Now he reached the glass clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It looked almost complete. Jeremy had designed a mechanism to go behind the face and Igor had got it made up, all in glass. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the <em class="calibre9">other </em>mechanism, which flickered away down behind the pendulum and took up a disconcertingly small amount of room now that it was assembled; quite a few of its parts were no longer sharing the same set of dimensions as the rest of it. But the clock had a face, and a face needed hands, and so the glass pendulum swung and the glass hands moved and told normal, everyday time. The “tick” had a slightly bell-like quality, as though someone were flicking a wineglass with a fingernail.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor looked at his hand-me-down hands. They were beginning to worry him. Now that the glass clock <em class="calibre9">looked </em>like a clock, they began to shake every time Igor came near it. </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>

      <div class="paragraph">No one noticed Susan in the library of the Guild of Historians, leafing her way through a pile of books. Occasionally she made a note.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She didn't know if her other gift was from Death, but she'd always told the children that they had a lazy eye and a business eye. There were two ways of looking at the world. The lazy eye just saw the surface. The business eye saw through into the reality beneath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She turned a page.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Seen through her business eye, history was very strange indeed. The scars stood out. The history of the country of Ephebe was puzzling, for example. Either its famous philosophers lived for a very long time, or they inherited their names, or extra bits had been stitched into history there. The history of Omnia was a <em class="calibre9">mess</em>. Two centuries had been folded into one, by the look of it, and it was only because of the mind-set of the Omnians, whose religion in any case mixed the past and future with the present, that it could possibly have passed unnoticed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And what about Koom Valley? Everyone knew that there had been a famous battle there, between dwarfs and trolls and mercenaries on both sides, but how many battles had there actually <em class="calibre9">been</em>? Historians talked about the valley being in just the right place in disputed territory to become more or less the preferred local pitch for all confrontations, but you could just as easily believe—at least you could if you had a grandfather called Death—that a patch that just happened to fit had been welded into history several times, so that different generations went round through the whole stupid disaster again and again, shouting “Remember Koom Valley!” as they did so.<a href="#TOT_APF13" title="13. Every society needs a cry like that, but only in a very few do they come out with the complete, unvarnished version, which is “Remember-the-Atrocity-Committed-Against-Us-Last-Time-That-Will-Excuse-the-Atrocity-That-We're-About-to-Commit-Today! And So On! Hurrah!”"><sup class="calibre10">13</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were anomalies everywhere.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And no one had noticed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">You had to hand it to human beings. They had one of the strangest powers in the universe. Even her grandfather had remarked upon it. No other species anywhere in the world had invented <em class="calibre9">boredom</em>. Perhaps it was boredom, not intelligence, that had propelled them up the evolutionary ladder. Trolls and dwarfs had it, too, that strange ability to look at the universe and think “oh, the same as yesterday, how dull. I wonder what happens if I bang this rock on that head?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And along with this had come an associated power, to make things <em class="calibre9">normal</em>. The world changed mightily, and within a few days humans considered it was <em class="calibre9">normal</em>. They had the most amazing ability to shut out and forget what didn't fit. They told themselves little stories to explain away the inexplicable, to make things <em class="calibre9">normal</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Historians were especially good at it. If it suddenly looked as though hardly anything had happened in the fourteenth century, they'd weigh in with twenty different theories. Not one of these would be that maybe most of the time had been cut out and pasted into the nineteenth century, where the Crash had not left enough coherent time for everything that needed to happen, because it only takes a week to invent the horse collar.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The History Monks had done their job well, but their biggest ally was the human ability to think narratively. And humans had risen to the occasion. They'd say things like “Thursday already? What happened to the week?” and “Time seems to go a lot faster these days…” and “It seems like only yesterday…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But some things remained.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Monks had carefully wiped out the time when the Glass Clock had struck. It had been surgically removed from history. Almost…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan picked up <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales </em>again. Her parents hadn't bought her books like this when she was a child. They'd tried to bring her up <em class="calibre9">normally</em>; they knew that it is not entirely a good idea for humans to be too close to Death. They taught her that facts were more important than fancy. And then she'd grown up and found out that the real fantasies weren't the Pale Rider or the Tooth Fairy or bogeymen—<em class="calibre9">they </em>were all solid facts. The big fantasy was that the world was the place where the toast didn't care if it came butter side down or not, where logic was sensible, and where things could be made not to have happened.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Something like the Glass Clock had been too big to hide. It had leaked out via the dark, hidden labyrinths of the human mind, and had become a folk tale. People had tried to coat it with sugar and magic swords, but its true nature still lurked like a rake in an overgrown lawn, ready to rise up at the incautious foot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Now someone was treading on it again, and the point, the key point, was that the chin it was rising to meet belonged to…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…<em class="calibre9">someone like me</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She sat and stared at nothing for a while. Around her, historians climbed library ladders, fumbled books onto their lecterns and generally rebuilt the image of the past to suit the eyesight of today. One of them was in fact looking for his glasses.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Time had a son, she thought, someone who walks in the world.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a man who devoted himself to the study of time so wholeheartedly that, for him, time became real. He learned the ways of time and Time noticed him, Death had said. There was something there like love.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And Time had a son.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">How? Susan had the kind of mind that would sour a narrative with a question like that. Time and a mortal man. How could they ever…? Well, how <em class="calibre9">could </em>they?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she thought: my grandfather is Death. He adopted my mother. My father was his apprentice for a while. That's all that happened. They were both human, and I turned up in the normal way. There is <em class="calibre9">no </em>way I should be able to walk through walls and live outside time and be a little bit immortal, but I am, and so this is not an area where logic and, let's face it, basic biology have any part to play.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In any case, time is constantly creating the future. The future contains things that didn't exist in the past. A small baby should be easy for something… <em class="calibre9">someone </em>who rebuilds the universe once every instant.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed. And you had to remember that Time probably wasn't time, in the same way that Death wasn't exactly the same as death and War wasn't exactly the same as war. She'd met War, a big fat man with an inappropriate sense of humour and a habit of losing the thread, and he certainly didn't personally attend every minor fracas. She disliked Pestilence, who gave her funny looks, and Famine was just wasted and weird. None of them <em class="calibre9">ran </em>their… call it their discipline. They <em class="calibre9">personified </em>it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Given that she'd met the Tooth Fairy, the Soul Cake Duck and Old Man Trouble, it amazed Susan that she had grown up to be mostly human, nearly normal.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As she stared at her notes, her hair unwound itself from its tight bun and took up its ground-state position, which was the hair of someone who had just touched something highly electrical. It spread out around her head like a cloud, with one black streak of nearly normal hair.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Grandfather might be an ultimate destroyer of worlds and the final truth of the universe, but that wasn't to say he didn't take an interest in the little people. Perhaps Time did, too.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She smiled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Time waited for no man, they said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Perhaps she'd waited for one, once.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan was aware that someone <em class="calibre9">was </em>looking at her, turned and saw the Death of Rats peering through the lens of the glasses belonging to the mildly distracted man searching for them on the other side of the room. Up on a long-disregarded bust of a former historian the raven preened itself.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, he is, is he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The doors of the library were nuzzled open and a white horse walked in. There is a terrible habit amongst horsy people to call a white horse “grey”, but even one of that bowlegged fraternity would have had to admit that this horse, at least, was white—not as white as snow, which is a dead white, but at least as white as milk, which is alive. His bridle and reins were black, and so was the saddle, but all of them were in a sense just for show. If the horse of Death was inclined to let you ride him, then you'd stay on, saddle or no. And there was no upper limit to the number of people he could carry. After all, plagues sometimes happened suddenly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The historians paid him no attention. Horses did not walk into libraries.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan mounted. There were plenty of times when she wished she'd been born completely human and wholly normal, but the reality was that she'd give it all up tomorrow—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–apart from Binky.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A moment later, four hoofprints glowed like plasma in the air above the library, and then faded away.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">The crunch-crunch of the yeti's feet over the snow and the eternal wind of the mountains were the only sounds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then Lobsang said, “By ‘cut off his head’, you actually mean…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sever the head from the body,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And,” said Lobsang, still in the tones of one carefully exploring every corner of the haunted cave, “he doesn't mind?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Waal, it's a nuisance,” said the yeti. “A bit of a paarty trick. But it's okaay, if it helps. The sweeper haas alwaays been a goood friend to us. We owe him faavours.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've tried teaching 'em the Way,” said Lu-Tze proudly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yaas. Ver' usefuul. ‘A washed pot never boils,’” said the yeti.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Curiosity vied with annoyance in Lobsang's head, and won.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What have I missed here?” he said. “You don't die?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I doon't die? Wit my head cut off? For laughing! Ho. Ho,” said the yeti. “Of course I die. But this is not such a sizeaable traansaaction.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It took us <em class="calibre9">years </em>to work out what the yetis were up to,” said Lu-Tze. “Their loops played hob with the Mandala until the abbot worked out how to allow for them. They've been extinct three times.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Three times, eh?” said Lobsang. “That's a lot of times to go extinct. I mean, most species only manage it once, don't they?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti was entering taller forest now, of ancient pines.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This'd be a good place,” said Lu-Tze. “Put us down, sir.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And we'll chop your head off,” said Lobsang weakly. “What am I saying? <em class="calibre9">I</em>'m not going to chop anyone's head off!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You heard him say it doesn't worry him,” said Lu-Tze, as they were gently lowered to the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's not the point!” said Lobsang hotly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's <em class="calibre9">his </em>head,” Lu-Tze pointed out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But <em class="calibre9">I </em>mind!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, well, in that case,” said Lu-Tze, “is it not written, ‘If you want a thing done properly you've got to do it yourself’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yaas, it is,” said the yeti.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze took the sword out of Lobsang's hand. He held it carefully, like someone unused to weapons. The yeti obligingly knelt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're up to date?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yaas.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I cannot believe you're really doing this!” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Interesting,” said Lu-Tze. “Mrs Cosmopilite says, ‘Seeing is believing,’ and, strangely enough, the Great Wen said, ‘I have seen, and I believe’!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He brought the sword down and cut off the yeti's head.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">There was a sound rather like a cabbage being sliced in half, and then a head rolled into the basket to cheers and cries of “Oh, I say, well done!” from the crowd. The city of Quirm was a nice, peaceful, law-abiding place and the city council kept it that way with a penal policy that combined the maximum of deterrence with the minimum of re-offending.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">GRIPPER “THE BUTCHER” SMARTZ?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The late Gripper rubbed his neck.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I demand a retrial!” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THIS MAY NOT BE A GOOD TIME, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It couldn't possibly have been murder because the…” The soul of Gripper Smartz fumbled in its spectral pockets for a ghostly piece of paper, unfolded it and continued, in a voice of those to whom the written word is an uphill struggle, “…because the bal-ance of my mind was d… dess-turbed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">REALLY, said Death. He found it best to let the recently departed get things off their chest.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, 'cos I really, really <em class="calibre9">wanted </em>to kill him, right? And you can't tell me that's a normal frame of mind, right? He was a dwarf, anyway, so I don't think that should count as manslaughter.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I UNDERSTAND THAT WAS THE SEVENTH DWARF YOU KILLED, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm very prone to being dess-turbed,” said Gripper. “Really, it's <em class="calibre9">me </em>who's the victim here. All I needed was a bit of understanding, someone to see <em class="calibre9">my </em>point of view for five minutes…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WHAT <em class="calibre9">WAS </em>YOUR POINT OF VIEW?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All dwarfs need a damn good kicking, in my opinion. 'Ere, you're Death, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES INDEED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm a big fan! I've always wanted to meet you, y'know? I've got a tattoo of you on my arm, look here. Done it <em class="calibre9">meself</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The benighted Gripper turned at the sound of hooves. A young woman in black, entirely unregarded by the crowd, who were gathered around the food stalls and souvenir stands and the guillotine, was leading a large white stallion towards them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you've even got valet parking!” said Gripper. “Now that's what I call <em class="calibre9">style</em>!” and with that he faded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WHAT A CURIOUS PERSON, said Death. AH, SUSAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING. OUR SEARCH NARROWS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Our search?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOUR SEARCH, IN FACT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's just mine now, is it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO ATTEND TO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“More important than the end of the world?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT <em class="calibre9">IS </em>THE END OF THE WORLD. THE RULES SAY THAT THE HORSEMEN SHALL RIDE OUT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That old legend? But you don't <em class="calibre9">have </em>to do that!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT IS ONE OF MY FUNCTIONS. I HAVE TO OBEY THE RULES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why? <em class="calibre9">They're </em>breaking the rules!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BENDING THEM. THEY HAVE FOUND A LOOPHOLE. I DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF IMAGINATION.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was like Jason and the Battle for the Stationery Cupboard, Susan told herself. You soon learned that “No one is to open the door of the Stationery Cupboard” was a prohibition that a seven year-old simply would not understand. You had to <em class="calibre9">think</em>, and rephrase it in more immediate terms, like, “No one, Jason, no matter what, no, not even if they thought they heard someone shouting for help, no one—are you paying attention, Jason?—is to open the door of the Stationery Cupboard, or accidentally fall on the door handle so that it opens, or threaten to steal Richenda's teddy bear unless she opens the door of the Stationery Cupboard, or be standing nearby when a mysterious wind comes out of nowhere and blows the door open all by itself, honestly, it really did, or in any way open, cause to open, ask anyone else to open, jump up and down on the loose floorboard to open or in any other way seek to obtain entry to the Stationery Cupboard, <em class="calibre9">Jason</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A loophole,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, why can't you find one too?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I AM THE GRIM REAPER. I DO NOT THINK PEOPLE WISH ME TO GET… CREATIVE. THEY WOULD WISH ME TO DO THE TASK ASSIGNED TO ME AT THIS TIME, BY CUSTOM AND PRACTICE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And that's just… riding out?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where to?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERYWHERE, I THINK. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU WILL NEED THIS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death handed her a lifetimer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was one of the <em class="calibre9">special </em>ones, slightly bigger than normal. She took it reluctantly. It looked like an hourglass, but all those little glittering shapes tumbling through the pinch were seconds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know I don't like doing the… the whole scythe thing,” she said. “It's not—Hey, this is really heavy!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">HE IS LU-TZE, A HISTORY MONK. EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS OLD. HE HAS AN APPRENTICE. I HAVE LEARNED THIS. BUT I CANNOT FEEL HIM, I CANNOT SEE HIM. HE IS THE ONE. BINKY WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MONK, YOU WILL FIND THE CHILD.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And then what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SUSPECT HE WILL NEED SOMEONE. WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HIM, LET BINKY GO. I SHALL NEED HIM.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan's lips moved as a memory collided with a thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To ride out on?” she said. “Are you <em class="calibre9">really </em>talking about the <em class="calibre9">Apocalypse</em>? Are you <em class="calibre9">serious</em>? No one believes in that sort of thing any more!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I DO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan's jaw dropped. “You're really going to do that? Knowing everything you know?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death patted Binky on the muzzle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES, he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan gave her grandfather a sideways look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hold on, there's a trick, isn't there…? You're planning something and you're not even going to tell me, right? You're not really going to just wait for the world to end and <em class="calibre9">celebrate </em>it, are you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WE WILL RIDE OUT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU WILL NOT TELL THE RIVERS NOT TO FLOW. YOU WILL NOT TELL THE SUN NOT TO SHINE. YOU WILL NOT TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it's so—” Susan's expression changed, and Death flinched. “I thought you <em class="calibre9">cared</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TAKE THIS ALSO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Without wanting to, Susan took a smaller lifetimer from her grandfather.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SHE MAY TALK TO YOU.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And who is <em class="calibre9">this</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE MIDWIFE, said Death. NOW… FIND THE SON.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He faded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked down at the lifetimers in her hands. He's done it to you <em class="calibre9">again</em>! she screamed at herself. You don't have to do this and you can put this thing down and you can go back to the classroom and you can be normal again and you just <em class="calibre9">know </em>that you won't, and so does he—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats was sitting between Binky's ears, grasping a lock of the white mane and giving the general impression of someone anxious to be going. Susan raised a hand to slap him off, and then stopped herself. Instead, she pushed the heavy lifetimers into the <em class="calibre9">rat's </em>paws.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Make yourself useful,” she said, grasping the reins. “Why do I <em class="calibre9">do </em>this?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have <em class="calibre9">not </em>got a nice nature!”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">There was not, surprisingly, a great deal of blood. The head rolled into the snow, and the body slowly toppled forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now you've killed—” Lobsang began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a second,” said Lu-Tze. “Any moment now…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The headless body vanished. The kneeling yeti turned his head to Lu-Tze, blinked and said, “Thaat stung a biit.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze turned to Lobsang. “Now, hold on to that memory!” he commanded. “It'll try to vanish, but you've had training. You've got to go on remembering that you saw something that now <em class="calibre9">did not happen</em>, understand? Remember that time's a lot less unbending than people think, if you get your head right! Just a little lesson! Seeing is believing!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did it <em class="calibre9">do </em>that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good question. They can save their life up to a certain point and go back to it if they get killed,” said Lu-Tze. “<em class="calibre9">How </em>it's done… well, the abbot spent the best part of a decade working that one out. Not that anyone else can understand it. There's a lot of quantum involved.” He took a pull of his permanent foul cigarette. “Gotta be <em class="calibre9">good </em>working-out, if no one else can understand it.”<a href="#TOT_APF14" title="14. The yeti of the Ramtops, where the Discworld's magical field is so intense that it is part of the very landscape, are one of the few creatures to utilize control of personal time for genetic advantage. The result is a kind of physical premonition—you find out what is going to happen next by allowing it to happen. Faced with danger, or any kind of task that involves risk of death, a yeti will save its life up to that point and then proceed with all due caution, yet in the comfortable knowledge that should everything go pancake-shaped, it will wake up at the point where it saved itself with, and this is the important part, knowledge of the events which have just happened but which will not now happen because it's not going to be such a damn fool next time. This is not quite the paradox it appears because, after it has taken place, it hasn't happened. All that actually remains is a memory in the yeti's head, which merely turns out to be a remarkably accurate premonition. The little eddies in time caused by all this are just lost in the noise of all the kinks, dips and knots put in time by every other living creature."><sup class="calibre10">14</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How is der abboott these daays?” said the yeti, getting to its feet again and picking up the pilgrims.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Teething.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Reincarnation's alwaays a problem,” said the yeti, falling into its long, ground-eating lope.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Teeth are the worst, he says. Always coming or going.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How fast are <em class="calibre9">we </em>going?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The yeti's stride was more like a continuous series of leaps from one foot to the other; there was so much spring in the long legs that each landing was a mere faint rocking sensation. It was almost restful.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I reckon we're doing thirty miles an hour or so, clock time,” said Lu-Tze. “Get some rest. We'll be above Copperhead in the morning. It's all downhill from there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Coming back from the dead…” Lobsang murmured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's more like not actually ever <em class="calibre9">going </em>in the first place,” said Lu-Tze. “I've studied them a bit, but… well, unless it's built in you'd have to <em class="calibre9">learn </em>how to do it, and would you want to bet on getting it right first time? Tricky one. You'd have to be desperate. I hope I'm never that desperate.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Susan recognized the country of Lancre from the air, a little bowl of woods and fields perched like a nest on the edge of the Ramtop mountains. And she found the cottage, too, which was not the corkscrew-chimneyed compost-heap kind of witch's house popularized by <em class="calibre9">Grim Fairy Tales </em>and other books, but a spanking new one with gleaming thatch and a manicured front lawn.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were more ornaments—gnomes, toadstools, pink bunnies, big-eyed deer—around a tiny pond than any sensible gardener should have allowed. Susan spotted one brightly painted gnome fishi—No, that wasn't a rod he was holding, was it? Surely a nice old lady wouldn't put something like <em class="calibre9">that </em>in her garden, would she? Would she?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan was bright enough to go round to the back, because witches were allergic to front doors. The door was opened by a small, fat, rosy-cheeked woman whose little currant eyes said, yep, that's my gnome all right, and be thankful he's only widdling in the pond.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Ogg? The midwife?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a pause before Mrs Ogg said, “The very same.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't know me, but—” said Susan, and realized that Mrs Ogg was looking past her at Binky, who was standing by the gate. The woman was a witch, after all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Maybe I do know you,” said Mrs Ogg. “O'course, if you just <em class="calibre9">stole </em>that horse, you just don't <em class="calibre9">know </em>how much trouble you're in.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I borrowed it. The owner is… my grandfather.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Another pause, and it was disconcerting how those friendly little eyes could bore into yours like an auger.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'd better come in,” said Mrs Ogg.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The inside of the cottage was as clean and new as the outside. Things gleamed, and there were a lot of them to gleam. The place was a shrine to bad but enthusiastically painted china ornaments, which occupied every flat surface. What space was left was full of framed pictures. Two harassed-looking women were polishing and dusting.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I got comp'ny,” said Mrs Ogg sternly, and the women left with such alacrity that the word “fled” might have been appropriate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My daughters-in-law,” said Mrs Ogg, sitting down in a plump armchair which, over the years, had shaped itself to fit her. “They like to help a poor old lady who's all alone in the world.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan took in the pictures. If they were all family members, Mrs Ogg was head of an army. Mrs Ogg, unashamedly caught out in a flagrant lie, went on: “Sit down, girl, and say what's on your mind. There's tea brewing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I want to know something.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Most people do,” said Mrs Ogg. “And they can go on wantin'.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I want to know about… a birth,” said Susan, persevering.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes? Well, I done hundreds of confinements. Thousands, prob'ly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I imagine this one was difficult.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A lot of them are,” said Mrs Ogg.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'd remember this one. I don't know how it started, but I'd imagine that a stranger came knocking.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh?” Mrs Ogg's face became a wall. The black eyes stared out at Susan as if she was an invading army.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're not helping me, Mrs Ogg.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right. I ain't,” said Mrs Ogg. “I think I know about you, miss, but I don't care who you are, you see. You can go and get the other one, if you like. Don't think I ain't seen him, neither. I've been at plenty of deathbeds, too. But deathbeds is public, mostly, and birthbeds ain't. Not if the lady don't want them to be. So you get the other one, and I'll spit in his eye.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is very important, Mrs Ogg.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're right there,” said Mrs Ogg firmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't say how long ago it was. It may have been last week, even. Time, that's the key.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there it was. Mrs Ogg was not a poker player, at least against someone like Susan. There was the tiniest flicker of the eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs Ogg's chair was rammed back in her effort to rise, but Susan got to the mantelpiece first and snatched what was there, hidden in plain view amongst the ornaments. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You give that here!” shouted Mrs Ogg, as Susan held it out of her reach. She could feel the power in the thing. It seemed to pulse in her hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Have you any idea what this <em class="calibre9">is</em>, Mrs Ogg?” she said, opening her hand to reveal the little glass bulbs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, it's an eggtimer that don't work!” Mrs Ogg sat down hard in her overstuffed chair, so that her little legs rose off the floor for a moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It looks to me like a day, Mrs Ogg. A day's worth of time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs Ogg glanced at Susan, and then at the little hourglass in her hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">reckoned </em>there was something odd about it,” she said. “The sand don't go through when you tip it up, see?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's because you don't need it to yet, Mrs Ogg.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg appeared to relax. Once again Susan reminded herself that she was dealing with a witch. They tended to keep up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I kept it 'cos it was a gift,” said the old lady. “And it looks so pretty, too. What do them letters round the edge say?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan read the words etched on the metal base of the lifetimer: <em class="calibre9">Tempus Redux</em>. “‘Time Returned’,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, that'd be it,” said Mrs Ogg. “The man did say I'd be repaid for my time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The man…?” said Susan gently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg glanced up, her eyes ablaze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't you try to take advantage of me just 'cos I'm moment'r'ly a bit flustered,” she snapped. “There's no way round Nanny Ogg!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked at the woman, and this time not with the lazy eye. And there was, indeed, no way round Mrs Ogg. But there was another way, with Mrs Ogg. It went straight through the heart.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A child needs to know his parents, Mrs Ogg,” she said. “Now more than ever. He needs to know who he really is. It's going to be hard for him, and I want to help him.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Because I wish someone had helped me,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but there's rules to midwifery,” said Nanny Ogg. “You don't say what was said or what you saw. Not if the lady don't want you to.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The witch wriggled awkwardly in her chair, her face going red. She wants to tell me, Susan knew. She's desperate to. But I've got to play it right, so she can square it with herself.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not asking for names, Mrs Ogg, because I expect you don't know them,” she went on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's true.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the child—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, miss, I'm not supposed to tell a living soul about—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If it helps, I'm not entirely certain that I am one,” said Susan. She watched Mrs Ogg for a while. “But I understand. There have to be rules, don't there? Thank you for your time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan stood up and put the preserved day back on the mantelpiece. Then she walked out of the cottage, shutting the door behind her. Binky was waiting by the gate. She mounted up, and it wasn't until then that she heard the door open.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's what <em class="calibre9">he </em>said,” said Mrs Ogg. “When he gave me the eggtimer. ‘Thank you for your time, Mrs Ogg,’ he said. You'd better come back in, my girl.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Death found Pestilence in a hospice in Llamedos. Pestilence liked hospitals. There was always something for him to do.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Currently he was trying to remove the “Now Wash Your Hands” sign over a cracked basin. He looked up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, it's you,” he said. “Soap? I'll give 'em soap!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SENT OUT THE CALL, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. Yes. Right. Yes,” said Pestilence, clearly embarrassed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU'VE STILL GOT YOUR HORSE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course, but…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU HAD A FINE HORSE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, Death… it's… look, it's not that I don't see your point, but—Excuse me…” Pestilence stepped aside as a white-robed nun, completely ignorant of the two Horsemen, passed between them. But he took the opportunity to breathe in her face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a mild flu,” he said, catching Death's expression.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SO WE CAN COUNT ON YOU, CAN WE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To ride out…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“For the Big One…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT'S EXPECTED OF US.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How many of the others have you got?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU ARE THE FIRST.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death sighed. Of course, there had been plenty of diseases, long before humans had been around. But humans had definitely created Pestilence. They had a genius for crowding together, for poking around in jungles, for siting the midden so handily next to the well. Pestilence was, therefore, part human, with all that this entailed. He was frightened.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SEE, he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The way you put it—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU ARE AFRAID?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll… think about it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. I AM SURE YOU WILL.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Quite a lot of brandy splashed into Mrs Ogg's mug. She waved the bottle vaguely at Susan, with an enquiring look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fair enough. Fair enough.” Nanny Ogg put the bottle aside and took a draught of the brandy as though it were beer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A man came knocking,” she said. “Three times he came, in my life. Last time was, oh, maybe ten days ago. Same man every time. He wanted a midwife—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ten days ago?” said Susan. “But the boy's at least sixt—” She stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, you've got it,” said Mrs Ogg. “I could see you was bright. Time didn't matter to him. He wanted the <em class="calibre9">best </em>midwife. And it was, like, he'd found out about me but got the date wrong, just like you or me could knock on the wrong door. Can you understand what I mean?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“More than you think,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The third time”—another gulp at the brandy—“he was in a bit of a state,” said Mrs Ogg. “That's how I knew he was just a man, despite everything that happened after. It was because he was panicking, to tell you the truth. Pregnant fathers often panic. He was going on about me coming right away and how there was no time. He had all the time in the world, he just wasn't thinking properly, 'cos husbands never do when the time comes. They panic 'cos it ain't their world any more.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And what happened next?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He took me in his, well, it was like one of them old chariots, he took me to…” Mrs Ogg hesitated. “I've seen a lot of strange things in my life, I'll have you know,” she said, as if preparing the ground for a revelation.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can believe it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was a castle made of glass.” Mrs Ogg gave Susan a look that dared her to disbelieve. Susan decided to hurry things up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mrs Ogg, one of my earliest memories is of helping to feed the Pale Horse. You know? The one outside? The horse of Death? His name is Binky. So please don't keep stopping. There is practically no limit to the things I find normal.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There was a woman… well <em class="calibre9">eventually </em>there was a woman,” said the witch. “Can you imagine someone exploding into a million pieces? Yes, I expect you can. Well, imagine it happening the other way. There's a mist and it's all flying together and then, whoosh, there's a woman. Then, whoosh, back into a mist again. And all the time, this noise…” Mrs Ogg ran her finger round the edge of the brandy glass, making it hum.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A woman kept… incarnating and then disappearing again? Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Because she was frightened, of course! First time, see?” Mrs Ogg grinned. “I person'ly never had any problems in that area, but I've been at a lot of births when it's all new to the girl and she'll be frightened as hell and when push comes to shove, if you take my meaning, old midwifery term, she'll be yellin' and swearin' at the father and I reckon that she'd give anything to be somewhere else. Well, this lady <em class="calibre9">could </em>be somewhere else. We'd have been in a real pickle if it wasn't for the man, as it turned out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The man who brought you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He was kind of foreign, you know? Like the Hub people. Bald as a coot. I remember thinking ‘You look like a young man, mister, but you look like you've been a young man for a long, long time if I'm any judge.’ Normally I wouldn't have any man there, but he sat and talked to her in his foreign lingo and sang her songs and little poems and soothed her and back she came, out of thin air, and I was ready and it was one, two, <em class="calibre9">done</em>. And then she was gone. Except that she was still there, I think. In the air.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What did she look like?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs Ogg gave her a Look. “You've got to remember the view I got where I was sitting,” she said. “The kind of description I might give you ain't a thing anyone'd put on a poster, if you get my meaning. And no woman looks at her best at a time like that. She was young, she had dark hair…” Mrs Ogg refilled her brandy glass and this meant the pause went on for some time. “And she was old, too, if you're after the truth of it. Not old like me. I mean <em class="calibre9">old</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stared at the fire. “Old like darkness and stars,” she said, to the flames.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The boy was left outside the Thieves' Guild,” said Susan, to break the silence. “I suppose they thought that with gifts like that he'd be all right.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The boy? Hah. Tell me, miss… why are we talking about <em class="calibre9">he</em>?”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean was being strong.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd never realized how much humans were controlled by their bodies. The thing nagged night and day. It was always too hot, too cold, too empty, too full, too tired…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The key was discipline, she was sure. Auditors were immortal. If she couldn't tell her body what to do, she didn't deserve to have one. Bodies were a major human weakness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Senses, too. The Auditors had hundreds of senses, since every possible phenomenon had to be witnessed and recorded. She could find only five available now. Five ought to be easy to deal with. But they were wired directly into the rest of the body! They didn't just submit information, they made demands!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd walked past a stall selling roasted meats and her mouth had started to drool! The sense of smell wanted the body to eat without consulting the brain! But that wasn't the worst of it! The brain <em class="calibre9">itself </em>did its own thinking!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">That was the hardest part. The bag of soggy tissue behind the eyes worked away independently of its owner. It took in information from the senses, and checked it all against memory, and presented options. Sometimes the hidden parts of it even fought for control of the mouth! Humans weren't individuals, they were, each one, a committee!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some of the other members of the committee were dark and red and entirely uncivilized. They had joined the brain before civilization; some of them had got aboard even before humanity. And the bit that did the joined-up thinking had to fight, in the darkness of the brain, to get the casting vote!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">After little more than a couple of weeks as a human, the entity that was Lady LeJean was having real trouble.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Food, for example. Auditors did not eat. They recognized that feeble life forms had to consume one another to obtain energy and body-building material. The process was astonishingly inefficient, however, and her ladyship had tried assembling nutrients directly out of the air. This worked, but the process felt… What was the word? Oh, yes… <em class="calibre9">creepy</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Besides, part of the brain didn't believe it was getting fed and insisted that it was hungry. Its incessant nagging interfered with her thought processes and so, despite everything, she'd had to face up to the whole, well, the whole <em class="calibre9">orifices </em>business.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors had known about these for a long time. The human body appeared to have up to eight of them. One didn't seem to work and the rest appeared to be multi-functional, although surprisingly there seemed to be only one thing that could be done by the ears.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Yesterday she'd tried a piece of dry toast.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had been the single worst experience of her existence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had been the single most <em class="calibre9">intense </em>experience of her existence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had been something else, too. As far as she could understand the language, it had been <em class="calibre9">enjoyable</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It seemed that the human sense of taste was quite different from the sense as employed by an Auditor. That was precise, measured, analytical. But the human sense of taste was like being hit in the mouth by the whole world. It had been half an hour of watching fireworks in her head before she remembered to swallow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">How did humans survive this?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She'd been fascinated by the art galleries. It was clear that some humans could present reality in a way that made it even more real, that spoke to the viewer, that seared the mind… but what could possibly transcend the knowledge that the genius of an artist had to poke alien substances into his face? Could it be that humans had got <em class="calibre9">used </em>to it? And that was only the <em class="calibre9">start</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sooner the clock was finished, the better. A species as crazy as this couldn't be allowed to survive. She was visiting the clockmaker and his ugly assistant every day now, giving them as much help as she dared, but they always seemed one vital step away from completion—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Amazing! She could even lie to <em class="calibre9">herself</em>! Because another voice in her head, which was part of the dark committee, said, “You're <em class="calibre9">not </em>helping, are you? You're stealing parts and twisting parts… and you go back every day because of the way he looks at you, don't you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Parts of the internal committee that were so old they didn't have voices, only direct control of the body, tried to interfere at this point. She tried in vain to put them out of her mind.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And now she had to face the other Auditors. They would be punctual.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She pulled herself together. Water had taken to running out of her eyes lately for no reason at all. She did the best she could with her hair, and made her way to the large drawing room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Greyness was already filling the air. In this space, there was not room for too many Auditors, but that did not really matter. One could speak for all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean found the corners of her mouth turned up automatically as nine of them appeared. Nine was three threes, and the Auditors <em class="calibre9">liked </em>threes. Two would keep an eye on the other one. <em class="calibre9">Each </em>two would keep an eye on <em class="calibre9">each </em>other one. They don't trust themselves, said one of the voices in her head. Another voice cut in: It's <em class="calibre9">we, we </em>don't trust ourselves. And she thought: Oh, yes. We, not they. I must remember I'm a we.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An Auditor said, <em class="calibre9">Why is there no further progress?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">The corners of the mouth turned down again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There have been minor problems of precision and alignment,” said Lady LeJean. She found that her hands were rubbing themselves together slowly, and wondered why. She hadn't <em class="calibre9">told </em>them to.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Auditors had never needed body language, so they didn't understand it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">What is the nature of—?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">But another one cut in with, <em class="calibre9">Why are you dwelling in this building</em>? The voice was tinted with suspicion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The body requires one to do things that cannot be done on the street,” said Lady LeJean, and, because she'd got to know something about Ankh-Morpork, she added, “at least, on many streets. Also, I believe the servant of the clockmaker is suspicious. I have allowed the body to yield to gravity, since that is what it was designed for. It is as well to give the appearance of humanity.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One, and it was the same one, said, <em class="calibre9">And what is the meaning of these?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">It had noticed the paints and the easel. Lady LeJean wished fervently that she'd remembered to put them away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The one said, <em class="calibre9">You are making an image with pigments?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. Very badly, I am afraid.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">For what reason?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wished to see how humans do it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">That is simple: the eye receives the input, the hand applies the pigment</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's what I thought, but it appears to be much more complex than that—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The one who had raised the question of the painting drifted towards one of the chairs and said, <em class="calibre9">And what is <strong class="calibre12">this</strong>?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is a cat. It arrived. It does not appear to wish to depart.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The cat, a feral ginger tom, flicked a serrated ear and curled up in a tighter ball. Anything that could survive in Ankh-Morpork's alleys, with their abandoned swamp dragons, dog packs and furriers' agents, was not about to open even one eye for a bunch of floating nightdresses.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The one who was now getting on Lady LeJean's nerves said: <em class="calibre9">And the reason for its presence?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It appears to tolerate the company of hu—of apparent humans, asking nothing in return but food, water, shelter and comfort,” said Lady LeJean. “This interests me. Our purpose <em class="calibre9">is </em>to learn, and thus I have, as you can see, begun.” She hoped it sounded better to them than it did to her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">When will the clock problems you spoke of be resolved</em>?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, soon. Very soon. Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The one that was beginning to terrify Lady LeJean said, <em class="calibre9">We wonder: is it possible that you are slowing the work in some way?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean felt a prickling on her forehead. Why was it doing that?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. Why should I slow the work? There would be no logic to it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Hmm</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And an Auditor did not say “Hmm” by accident. “Hmm” had a very precise meaning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It went on: <em class="calibre9">You are making moisture on your head</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. It's a body thing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Yes</em>. And that, too, had a very specific and <em class="calibre9">ominous</em> meaning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">We wonder if too long in a solid body weakens resolve. Also, we find it hard to see your thoughts</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Body again, I am afraid. The brain is a very imprecise instrument.” Lady LeJean got control of her hands at last. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">Yes</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Another said, <em class="calibre9">When water fills a jug, it takes the shape of the jug. But the water is not the jug, nor is the jug the water</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course,” said Lady LeJean. And, inside, a thought that she hadn't known she was thinking, a thought that turned up out of the darkness behind the eyes, said: We are surely the most stupid creatures in the universe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">It is not good to act alone</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She said, “Of course.” And once again a thought emerged from the darkness: I'm in trouble now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, <em class="calibre9">And therefore you will have companions. No blame attaches. One should never be alone. Together, resolve is strengthened</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Motes began to twinkle in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean's body backed away automatically and, when she saw what was forming, she backed it away further. She had seen humans in all states of life and death, but seeing a body being spun out of raw matter was curiously disquieting when you were currently inhabiting a similar one. It was one of those times when the stomach did the thinking, and thought it wanted to throw up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Six figures took shape, blinked, and opened their eyes. Three of the figures were male, three were female. They were dressed in human-sized equivalents of the Auditors' robes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The remaining Auditors drew back, but one said: <em class="calibre9">They will accompany you to the clockmaker, and matters will be resolved today. They will not eat or breathe</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Hah! thought one of the little voices that made up Lady LeJean's thinking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the figures whimpered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The body <em class="calibre9">will </em>breathe,” said her ladyship. “You will not persuade it that air is not required.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She was aware of the choking noises.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You are thinking, yes, we can exchange necessary materials with the outside world, and this is true,” she went on. “But the body <em class="calibre9">does not know that</em>. It thinks it is dying. Let it breathe.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a series of gasps.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you will feel better shortly,” said her ladyship, and was enthralled to hear the inner voice think: These are your jailers, and you are already stronger than them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the figures felt its face with a clumsy hand and, panting, said, “Whom do you speak to with your mouth?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Us?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This will take some explaining—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No,” said the Auditor. “Danger lies that way. We believe the body imposes a method of thought on the brain. No blame attaches. It is a… malfunction. We will accompany you to the clockmaker. We will do this now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not in those clothes,” said Lady LeJean. “You will frighten him. It may lead to irrational actions.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a moment of silence. The Auditors-made-flesh looked hopelessly at one another. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You have to talk with your mouth,” Lady LeJean prompted. “The minds stay inside the head.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One said, “What is wrong with these clothes? It is a simple shape found in many human cultures.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean walked to the window. “See the people down there?” she said. “You must dress in appropriate city fashions.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Reluctantly the Auditors did so, and, while they retained the greyness, they did give themselves clothes that would pass unnoticed in the street. Up to a point, anyway.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only those of female appearance should wear dresses,” Lady LeJean pointed out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A hovering grey shape said, <em class="calibre9">Warning. Danger. The one calling itself Lady LeJean may give unsafe advice. Warning</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Understood,” said one of the incarnate ones. “We know the way. We will lead.” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">It walked into the door.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors clustered around the door for a while, and then one of them glared at Lady LeJean, who smiled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Doorknob,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditor turned back to the door, stared at the brass knob, and then looked the door up and down. It dissolved into dust.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Doorknob was simpler,” said Lady LeJean.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">There were big mountains around the Hub. But the ones towering above the temple didn't all have names, because there were simply too many of them. Only gods have enough time to name all the pebbles on a beach, but gods don't have the patience.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Copperhead was small enough to be big enough to have a name. Lobsang awoke and saw its crooked peak, towering above the lesser local mountains, outlined against the sunrise.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Sometimes the gods have no taste at all. They allow sunrises and sunsets in ridiculous pink and blue hues that any professional artist would dismiss as the work of some enthusiastic amateur who'd never looked at a real sunset. This was one of those sunrises. It was the kind of sunrise a man looks at and says, “No <em class="calibre9">real </em>sunrise could paint the sky Surgical Appliance Pink.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Nevertheless, it was beautiful.<a href="#TOT_APF15" title="15. But not tasteful."><sup class="calibre10">15</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang was half covered in a pile of dry bracken. There was no sign of the yeti.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was springtime here. There was still snow, but with the occasional patch of bare soil and a hint of green. He stared around, and saw leaves in bud.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was standing some way off, gazing up into a tree. He didn't turn his head as Lobsang approached.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where's the yeti?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He wouldn't go further than this. Can't ask a yeti to leave snow,” whispered Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh,” whispered Lobsang. “Er, why are we whispering?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look at the bird.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was perched on a branch by a fork in the tree, next to what looked like a birdhouse, and nibbling at a piece of roughly round wood it held in one claw.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Must be an old nest they're repairing,” said Lu-Tze. “Can't have got that advanced this early in the season.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Looks like some kind of old box to me,” said Lobsang. He squinted to see better. “Is it an old… clock?” he added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look at what the bird is nibbling,” suggested Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, it looks like… a crude gearwheel? But why—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well spotted. That, lad, is a clock cuckoo. A young one, by the look of it, trying to build a nest that'll attract a mate. Not much chance of that… See? It's got the numerals all wrong and it's stuck the hands on crooked.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A bird that <em class="calibre9">builds </em>clocks? I thought a cuckoo clock was a clock with a mechanical cuckoo that came out when—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And where do you think people got such a strange idea from?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But that's some kind of miracle!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?” said Lu-Tze. “They barely go for more than half an hour, they keep lousy time and the poor dumb males go frantic trying to keep them wound.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But even to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Everything happens somewhere, I suppose,” said Lu-Tze. “Not worth making too much of a fuss. Got any food left?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. We finished it last night,” said Lobsang. He added, hopefully, “Er… I heard tell that really advanced monks can live on the, er, life force in the actual air itself…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only on the planet Sausage, I expect,” said Lu-Tze. “No, we'll skirt Copperhead and find something in the valleys on the other side. Let's go, there's not much time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But time enough to watch a bird, thought Lobsang as he let the world around him become blue and fade, and the thought was comforting.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was easier going without the snow on the ground, provided he avoided the strange resistance offered by bushes and long grass. Lu-Tze walked on ahead, looking oddly colourful and unreal against the faded landscape.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They went past the entrance to dwarf mines, but saw no one above ground. Lobsang was glad of that. The statues he had seen in the villages yesterday weren't dead, he knew, but merely frozen at a different speed of time. Lu-Tze had forbidden him to go near anyone, but he needn't have bothered. Walking around the living statues was invasive, somehow. It made it worse when you realized that they <em class="calibre9">were </em>moving, but very, very slowly…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sun had barely moved from the horizon when they came down through warmer woods on the Rim side of the mountain. Here the landscape had a more domesticated air. It was woodland rather than forest. The game trail they'd been following crossed a creek at a point where there were cart tracks, old but still not overgrown.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked behind him after he'd walked across the ford, and watched the water very slowly reclaim the shape of his footprints in the stream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd been trained in time-slicing on the snowfields above the valley, like the rest of the novices. That was so they couldn't come to any harm, the monks had said, although no one actually explained what harm they <em class="calibre9">might </em>come to. Outside the monastery, this was the first time Lobsang had sliced in a living landscape.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was marvellous! Birds hung in the sky. Early morning bumblebees hovered over the opening flowers. The world was a crystal made of living things.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang slowed near a group of deer cropping the grass, and watched as the nearer eye of one of them swivelled, with geological slowness, to watch him. He saw the skin move as the muscles underneath started to bunch for flight…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Time for a smoko,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The world around Lobsang speeded up. The deer fled, along with the magic of the moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's a smoko?” said Lobsang. He was annoyed. The quiet slow world had been fun.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You ever been to Fourecks?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. There's a barman at the Bunch of Grapes from there, though.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze lit one of his skinny cigarettes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't mean much,” he said. “The barman <em class="calibre9">everywhere </em>is from there. Strange country. Big time source right in the middle, very useful. Time and space all tangled up. Probably all that beer. Nice place, though. Now, you see that country down there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On one side of the clearing the ground fell away steeply, showing treetops and, beyond, a small patchwork of fields tucked into a fold in the mountains. In the distance was a gorge, and Lobsang thought he could make out a bridge across it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Doesn't look much like a country,” he said. “Looks more like a shelf.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">That's </em>witch country,” said Lu-Tze. “And we're going to borrow a broomstick. Quickest way to Ankh-Morpork. Only way to travel.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Isn't that, er, interfering with history? I mean, I was told that sort of thing is all right up in the valleys, but down here in the world…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, it's absolutely forbidden,” said Lu-Tze. “'cos it's Interfering With History. Got to be careful of your witch, of course. Some of them are pretty canny.” He caught Lobsang's expression. “Look, that's why there's rules, understand? So that you <em class="calibre9">think </em>before you break 'em.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze sighed, and pinched out the end of his cigarette. “We're being watched,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang spun round. There were only trees, and insects buzzing in the early-morning air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Up there,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a raven perched on the broken crown of a pine tree, shattered in some winter storm. It looked at them looking at it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Caw?” it said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's just a raven,” said Lobsang. “There's lots of them in the valley.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was watching us when we stopped.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's ravens all over the mountains, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And when we met the yeti,” Lu-Tze persisted.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That settles it, then. It's coincidence. One raven couldn't move that fast.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Maybe it's a special raven,” said Lu-Tze. “Anyway, it's not one of our mountain ravens. It's a lowland raven. Mountain ravens croak. They don't caw. Why's it so interested in us?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a bit… weird, thinking you're being followed by a bird,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“When you get to my age you notice things in the sky,” said Lu-Tze. He shrugged and gave a grin. “You start worrying they might be vultures.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They faded into time, and vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The raven ruffled its feathers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Croak?” it said. “Damn.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang felt around under the thatched eaves of the cottage, and his hand closed on the bristles of a broomstick that had been thrust among the reeds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is rather like stealing,” he said, as Lu-Tze helped him down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, it's not,” said the sweeper, taking the broomstick and holding it up so he could look along its length. “And I'll tell you why. If we sort things out, we'll drop it off on our way back and she'll never know it's gone… and if we don't sort things out, well, she'll <em class="calibre9">still </em>never know it's gone. Honestly, they don't take much care of their sticks, witches. Look at the bristles on this one. I wouldn't use it to clean a pond! Oh, well… back into clock time, lad. I'd hate to fly one of these things while I was slicing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He straddled the stick and gripped the handle. It rose a little way.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good suspension, at least,” he said. “You can have the comfy seat on the back. Hold tight to my own broom and make sure you wrap your robe around you. These things are pretty breezy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang pulled himself aboard and the stick rose. As it drew level with the lower branches around the clearing, it brought Lu-Tze to eye level with a raven.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It shifted uneasily and turned its head this way and that, trying to fix both eyes on him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you going to caw or croak, I wonder,” said Lu-Tze, apparently to himself.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Croak,” said the raven.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So you're not the raven we saw on the other side of the mountain, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me? Gosh, no,” said the raven. “That's croaking territory over there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just checking.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The broom rose higher, and set off above the trees in a Hubwards direction.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The raven ruffled its feathers and blinked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Damn!” it said. It shuffled around the tree to where the Death of Rats was sitting.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, if you want me to do this undercover work you've got to get me a book on ornithology, okay?” said Quoth. “Let's go, or I'll never keep up.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Death found Famine in a new restaurant in Genua. He had a booth all to himself and was eating Duck and Dirty Rice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh,” said Famine. “It's you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. WE MUST RIDE. YOU MUST HAVE GOT MY MESSAGE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pull up a chair,” Famine hissed. “They do a very good alligator sausage here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SAID, WE MUST RIDE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death sat down and explained. Famine listened., although he never stopped eating.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see,” he said at last. “Thank you, but I think I shall sit this one out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SIT IT OUT? YOU'RE A HORSEMAN!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course. But what is my role here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I BEG YOUR PARDON?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No famine appears to be involved, does it? A shortage of food <em class="calibre9">per se</em>? As such?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WELL, NO. NOT AS SUCH, OBVIOUSLY, BUT—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So I would, as it were, be turning up just to wave. No, thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU USED TO RIDE OUT EVERY TIME, said Death accusingly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Famine waved a bone airily. “We had proper apocalypses in those days,” he said, and sucked at the bone. “You could sink your teeth into them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Famine pushed his plate aside and opened the menu. “There are other worlds,” he said. “You're too sentimental, Death. I've always said so.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death drew himself up. Humans had created Famine, too. Oh, there had always been droughts and locusts, but for a really good famine, for fertile land to be turned into a dustbowl by stupidity and avarice, you needed humans. Famine was arrogant.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I AM SORRY, he said, TO HAVE TRESPASSED ON YOUR TIME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He went outside, into the crowded street, all alone.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The stick swooped down towards the plains, and levelled off a few hundred feet above the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're on our way now!” shouted Lu-Tze, pointing ahead. Lobsang looked down at a slim wooden tower hung with complicated boxes. There was another one in the far distance, a toothpick in the morning mist.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Semaphore towers!” Lu-Tze shouted. “Ever seen them?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only in the city!” Lobsang shouted above the slipstream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's the Grand Trunk!” the sweeper shouted back. “Runs like an arrow all the way to the city! All we have to do is follow it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang clung on. There was no snow beneath them and it looked as though spring was well advanced. And therefore it was unfair that here, that much nearer the sun, the air was frigid and was being driven into his flesh by the wind of their travel.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's very cold up here!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes! Did I tell you about the double-knit combinations?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've got a spare pair in my sack. You can have them when we stop!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Your own personal pair?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes! Second-best but well darned!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thank you!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They've been washed!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Why </em>can't we slice when we're on this thing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The tower was well past them. The next one was pencil-sized already. The black-and-white shutters on the boxes were twinkling in the sunlight.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know what happens if you slice time on a magically powered vehicle travelling at more than seventy miles an hour?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me neither! And I don't want to find out!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor opened the door before the second knock. An Igor might be filling coffins with earth in the cellar, or up on the roof adjusting the lightning conductor, but a caller never had to knock twice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ladythip,” he muttered, nodding his head. He looked blankly at the six figures behind her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We have called to inspect progress,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And thethe ladieth and gentlemen, ladythip?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My associates,” said her ladyship, matching Igor's blank stare.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If you will be tho kind ath to thtep inthide, I will thee if the marthter ith in,” said Igor, observing the convention that a true butler never knows the whereabouts of anyone in the house until they decide they want it to be known.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He backed through the door into the workshop and then lurched into the kitchen, where Jeremy was calmly pouring a spoonful of medicine down the sink.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That woman ith here,” he said, “and thee hath brought <em class="calibre9">lawyerth</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy held out a hand, palm downwards, and examined it critically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You see, Igor?” he said. “Here we are, almost at the completion of our great work, and I remain absolutely calm. You could build a house on my hand, it is so steady.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Lawyerth</em>, thur,” said Igor, giving the word some extra spin.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And?” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, we have had a lot of money,” said Igor, with the conviction of a man who has informally secreted a small but sensible amount of gold in his own bag.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And we have finished the clock,” said Jeremy, still watching his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We've been <em class="calibre9">nearly </em>finithed for <em class="calibre9">dayth</em>,” said Igor darkly. “If it wathn't for <em class="calibre9">her,</em> I reckon we could've caught that thunderthtorm two dayth ago.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“When's the next one?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor screwed up his face and banged his temple a couple of times with the palm of his hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Unthettled conditionth with a low approaching from the Rim,” he said. “Can't promith anything with the thloppy weather you get here. Hah, back home the thunderthtormth come running ath thoon ath they thee you put up the iron pole. Tho what do you want me to do about the lawyerth?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Show them in, of course. We have nothing to hide.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you thure, thur?” said Igor, whose carpet bag could not in fact be lifted with one hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please <em class="calibre9">do </em>it, Igor.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy smoothed down his hair while the grumbling Igor disappeared into the shop and returned with the guests.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lady LeJean, thur. And thome other… people,” said Igor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's good to see you, your ladyship,” said Jeremy, smiling glassily. He vaguely remembered something he had read. “Won't you introduce me to your friends?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean gave him a nervous look. Oh, yes… humans always needed to know names. And he was smiling again. It made it so hard to <em class="calibre9">think</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr Jeremy, these are my… associates,” she said. “Mr Black. Mr Green. Miss Brown. Miss White. Miss… Yellow. And Mr Blue.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy held out his hand. “I am pleased to meet you,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Six pairs of eyes looked uncomprehendingly at the hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The custom here is to shake hands,” said her ladyship.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In unison, the Auditors extended a hand and wiggled it slowly in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The hand of the other person,” said her ladyship. She gave Jeremy a thin-lipped smile. “They are foreigners,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And she recognized the panic in their eyes, even if they didn't. We can count the number and types of atom in this room, they were thinking. How can there be anything in here we cannot understand?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy managed to catch one wavering hand in his. “And you are Mr—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditor turned worried eyes on Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr Black,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I understood that <em class="calibre9">we </em>were Mr Black,” said another male-shaped Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, you are Mr Green.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless, we would prefer Mr Black. We are the senior, and black is a more significant shade. We do not wish to be Mr Green.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The translation of your names is not, I think, important,” said Lady LeJean. She gave Jeremy another smile. “They are my accountants,” she added, some reading on her part having suggested that this might excuse most oddities.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You see, Igor?” said Jeremy. “They are simply accountants.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor grimaced. Where his baggage was concerned; accountants were probably worse news than lawyers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Grey would be acceptable,” said Mr Green.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless, you are Mr Green. We are Mr Black. It is a matter of status.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If that is the case,” said Miss White, “white is higher status than black. Black is absence of colour.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The point is valid,” said Mr Black. “Therefore we are now Mr White. You are Miss Red.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You previously indicated that you were Mr Black.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“New information indicates a change of position. This does not indicate incorrectness of said previous position.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It's happening already, thought Lady LeJean. It's in the darkness where your eyes can't see. The universe becomes two halves, and you live in the half behind the eyes. Once you have a body, you have a “me”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I have seen galaxies die. I have watched atoms dance. But until I had the dark behind the eyes, I didn't know the death from the dance. And we were wrong. When you pour water into a jug, it becomes jug-shaped <em class="calibre9">and it is not the same water any more</em>. An hour ago they never dreamed of having names, and now they are arguing about them…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And they can't hear what I think!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She wanted more <em class="calibre9">time</em>. The habits of a billion years don't yield entirely to a mouthful of dry toast, and she could see that a crazy life-form like humanity should not be allowed to exist. Yes, indeed. Certainly. Of course.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But she wanted more time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They should be studied. Yes, studied.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There should be… reports. Yes. Reports. Full reports. Long, long full reports.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Caution. That was it. That was the word! Auditors <em class="calibre9">loved </em>that word. Always put off until tomorrow something which, tomorrow, you could put off until, let's say, next year.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It has to be said that Lady LeJean was not herself at this point. She didn't quite have a herself to be. The other six Auditors… in <em class="calibre9">time</em>, yes, they'd think the same way. But there wasn't <em class="calibre9">time</em>. If only she could persuade them to <em class="calibre9">eat </em>something. That would… yes, that would bring them to their senses. There seemed to be no food around, though.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She <em class="calibre9">could </em>see a very large hammer on the bench.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How is progress, Mr Jeremy?” she said, walking over to the clock. Igor moved very fast, and stood almost protectively next to the glass pillar.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy hurried forward. “We have carefully aligned all the systems—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—again—” Igor growled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, again—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Theveral timeth, in fact,” Igor added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now we simply await the right weather conditions.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I thought you stored lightning?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her ladyship indicated the greenish glass cylinders bubbling and hissing along the wall of the workshop. Just by the bench with, yes, the hammer on it. And no one could read her thoughts! The <em class="calibre9">power!</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There will easily be enough to keep the mechanism working, but to start the clock will require what Igor calls a <em class="calibre9">jump</em>,” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor held up two crocodile clips the size of his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“'Th'right,” he said. “But you hardly ever get the right kind of thunderthtormth down here. Thould've built thith in Uberwald, I keep thaying.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is the nature of this delay?” said—possibly—Mr White.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We need a thunderstorm, sir. For the lightning,” said Jeremy. Lady LeJean stepped back, a little closer to the bench.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well? Arrange one,” said Mr White.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah, well, if we were in Uberwald, of courthe—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is merely a matter of pressures and potentials,” said Mr White. “Can you not simply create one?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor gave him a look of disbelief mixed with respect.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're not from Uberwald, are you?” he said. Then he gasped, and banged the side of his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hey, I felt <em class="calibre9">that </em>one,” he said. “Whoopth! How did you do that? Prethure dropping like a <em class="calibre9">thtone</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Sparks glittered along his black fingernails. He beamed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll jutht go and raithe the lightning rod,” he said, hurrying to a pulley system on the wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean turned on the others. This time she wished they <em class="calibre9">could </em>read her thoughts. She didn't know enough pronounceable human swearwords.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is <em class="calibre9">against the rules</em>!” she hissed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mere expediency,” said Mr White. “If you had not been… lax, this would have been concluded by now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I counselled further study!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Unnecessary!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is there a problem?” said Jeremy, in the diffident voice he used for conversations not involving clocks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The clock should not be started yet!” said Lady LeJean, not taking her eyes off the other Auditors.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you <em class="calibre9">asked </em>me… we've been… it's all set up!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There may be… problems! I think we should see another week of testing!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But there weren't problems, she knew. Jeremy had built the thing as if he'd built a dozen like it before. It had been all Lady LeJean could do to spin things out this long, especially with the Igor watching her like a hawk.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is your ‘name’, young person?” said Mr White to Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clockmaker backed away. “Jeremy,” he said, “and I… I don't understand, Mr, er, White. A clock tells the time. A clock isn't <em class="calibre9">dangerous</em>. How can a clock be a problem? It's a <em class="calibre9">perfect </em>clock!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then start it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But her ladyship—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The door knocker thundered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Igor?” said Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur?” said Igor, from the hallway.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did the servant person get there?” said Mr White, still watching her ladyship.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a, a sort of trick they, they have,” said Jeremy. “I'm, I'm sure it's only—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It'th Dr Hopkinth, thur,” said Igor, entering from the hall. “I told him you were buthy, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–but Dr Hopkins, although apparently as mild-mannered as milk, was also a Guild official and had survived as such for several years. Ducking under Igor's arm was no problem at all for a man who could handle a meeting of clockmakers, no two of whom exactly ticked in time with the rest of humanity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just happened to have business this way,” he began, smiling brightly, “and it was no trouble to drop in at the apothecary to pick up—Oh, you have company?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor grimaced, but there was the Code to think of.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thall I make thome tea, thur?” he said, as all the Auditors glared at the doctor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is this tea?” Mr White demanded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is protocol!” snapped Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White hesitated. Protocol was important.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, er, er, yes,” said Jeremy. “Tea, Igor, please. Please.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My word, I see you have finished your clock!” said Dr Hopkins, apparently oblivious of an atmosphere that could have floated iron. “What a magnificent piece of work!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors stared at one another as the doctor ambled past them and looked up at the glass face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well done indeed, Jeremy!” he said, removing his glasses and polishing them enthusiastically. “And what is this pretty blue glow?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's, it's the crystal ring,” said Jeremy. “It, it—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It spins light,” said Lady LeJean. “And then it makes a hole in the universe.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said Dr Hopkins, putting his glasses back on. “What an original idea! Does a cuckoo come out?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Of the very worst words that can be heard by anyone high in the air, the pair known as “Oh-oh” possibly combine the maximum of bowel-knotting terror with the minimum wastage of breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When Lu-Tze uttered them, Lobsang didn't need a translation. He'd been watching the clouds for some time. They were getting blacker, and thicker, and darker.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The handle's tingling!” shouted Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's because there's a storm right above us!” screamed Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The sky was as clear as a bell a few minutes ago!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ankh-Morpork was much closer now. Lobsang could make out some of the taller buildings, and see the river snaking across the plain. But the storm was coming up all around the city.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm going to have to land this thing while I can!” Lu-Tze said. “Hold on…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The stick dropped until it was a few feet above the cabbage fields. The plants were a rushing green blur inches below Lobsang's sandals.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang heard another word that, while not the <em class="calibre9">worst </em>you can hear while airborne, is not at all good when it's said by the person steering.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know how to <em class="calibre9">stop </em>this?” yelled Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not in so many words,” shouted Lu-Tze. “Hold on, I'm going to try something…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The stick tilted up but kept moving in the same direction. The bristles dipped into the cabbages.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It took the width of a field to slow down, at the end of a furrow with the smell that only squashed cabbage leaves can yield.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How fine can you slice time?” the sweeper said, scrambling over the battered plants.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm pretty good—” Lobsang began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Get better quick!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze faded to blue as he ran towards the city. Lobsang caught him up within a hundred yards but the sweeper was still fading, still slicing time thinner and thinner. The apprentice gritted his teeth and followed, straining every muscle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The old man might be a fraud when it came to fighting, but there was no kidding here. The world went from blue to indigo to an inky, unnatural darkness, like the shadow of an eclipse.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This was deep time. You couldn't stay there long, he knew. Even if you could tolerate the ghastly chill, there were parts of the body that just weren't designed for this. Go too far down, too, and you'd die if you came back too quickly…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He hadn't seen it, of course, no apprentice had, but there were some quite graphic drawings in the classrooms. A man's life could become very, very painful if his blood began to move through time faster than his bones. It would also be very short.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't… keep this up…” he panted, running after Lu-Tze in the violet gloom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You can,” gasped the sweeper. “You're fast, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not… trained… for <em class="calibre9">this</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The city was getting closer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No one's trained for this!” growled Lu-Tze. “You do it, and you find out that you're good at it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What happens if you find out you're no good?” said Lobsang. The going felt easier now. He no longer had the feeling that his skin was trying to drag itself off him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Dead men don't find things out,” said Lu-Tze. He turned his head to his apprentice and his evil grin was a yellow-toothed curve in the shadows. “Getting the hang?” he added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm… I'm on top of it…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right! Then now that we've warmed up…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To Lobsang's horror, the sweeper faded further into the dark.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He called up reserves he knew he didn't have. He screamed at his liver to stay with him, thought that he felt his brain creak, and plunged on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The shape of Lu-Tze lightened as Lobsang drew level with him in time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Still here? One last effort, lad!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You bloody well can!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang gulped freezing air and fell onwards—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–where the light was suddenly a calm, pale blue and Lu-Tze was trotting gently between the frozen carts and unmoving people around the city's gate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“See? Nothing to it,” said the sweeper. “Just <em class="calibre9">maintain</em>, that's all. Nice and steady.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was like balancing on a wire. It was fine if you didn't think about it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But all the scrolls say you go to blue and violet and into the black and then you hit the Wall,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, well, <em class="calibre9">scrolls</em>,” said Lu-Tze, and left it there, as if the tone of voice said it all. “This is Zimmerman's Valley, lad. It helps if you know it's here. The abbot said it's something to do with… what was it?… Oh, yeah, boundary conditions. Something like… the foam on the tide. We're right on the edge, boy!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I can breathe easily!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah. Shouldn't happen. Keep moving about, though, otherwise you'll exhaust all the good air around your body field. Good old Zimmerman, eh? One of the best, he was. And he reckoned there was another dip even closer to the Wall, too.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Did he ever find it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't think so.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The way he exploded gave me a hint. Don't worry! You can maintain the slice easily here. You don't have to think about it. You've got <em class="calibre9">other </em>things to think about! Keep an eye on those clouds!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked up. Even in this blue-on-blue landscape, the clouds over the city looked ominous.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's what happened back in Uberwald,” said Lu-Tze. “The clock needs a lot of power. The storm blew up out of nowhere.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the city's huge! How can we find a clock here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“First, we're going to head for the centre,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Because with luck we won't have to run so far when the lightning strikes, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sweeper, no one can outrun lightning!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze spun round and grabbed Lobsang by the robe, dragging him closer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then tell me where to run, speedy boy!” he shouted. “There's more to you than meets the third eye, lad! No apprentice should be able to find Zimmerman's Valley! It takes hundreds of years of training! And no one should be able to make the spinners sit up and dance to his tune the very first time he sees them! Think I'm daft, do you? Orphan boy, strange power… what the hell are you? The Mandala <em class="calibre9">knew </em>you! Well, I'm just a mortal human, and what I know is, I'll be damned if I'll see the world shattered a second time! So <em class="calibre9">help me</em>! Whatever it is you've got, I need it now! Use it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He let go, and stood back. A vein in his bald head was throbbing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I don't know what I can do to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Find out what you can do</em>!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Protocol. Rules. Precedent. <em class="calibre9">Ways of doing things</em>. That's how we've always worked, thought Lady LeJean. <em class="calibre9">This </em>and <em class="calibre9">this </em>must follow <em class="calibre9">that</em>. It has always been our strength. I wonder if it can be a weakness?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If looks could have killed, Dr Hopkins would have been a smear on the wall. The Auditors watched his every move like cats watching a new species of mouse.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean had been incarnate much longer than the others. Time can change a body, especially when you've never had one before. She wouldn't have stared and fumed. She would have clubbed the doctor to the ground. What was one more human?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She realized, with some amazement, that the thought there was a <em class="calibre9">human </em>thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the other six were still wet behind the ears. They hadn't yet realized the dimensions of duplicity that you needed to survive as a human being. They clearly found it hard to think inside the little dark world behind the eyes, too. Auditors reached decisions in concert with thousands, <em class="calibre9">millions </em>of other Auditors.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Sooner or later they'd learn to be their own thinkers, though. It might take a while, because they'd try to learn from one another first.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the moment they were watching Igor's tea tray with great suspicion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Drinking tea <em class="calibre9">is </em>protocol,” said Lady LeJean. “I must insist.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is this correct?” Mr White barked at Dr Hopkins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said the doctor. “With a ginger biscuit, usually,” he added hopefully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A ginger biscuit,” repeated Mr White. “A biscuit of red-brown colouring?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeth, thur,” said Igor. He nodded to the plate on his tray.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I would like to try a ginger biscuit,” volunteered Miss Red.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Oh yes, thought Lady LeJean, <em class="calibre9">please </em>try the ginger biscuits.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We do not eat or drink!” snapped Mr White. He gave Lady LeJean a look of deep suspicion. “It could cause incorrect ways of thinking.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it is the custom,” said Lady LeJean. “To ignore protocol is to draw attention.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White hesitated. But he was a quick adaptor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is against our religion!” he said. “Correct!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was an amazing leap. It was <em class="calibre9">inventive</em>. And he'd come up with it all alone. Lady LeJean was impressed. The Auditors had tried to understand religion, because so much that made no sense whatsoever was done in its name. But it could also excuse practically any kind of eccentricity. Genocide, for example. By comparison, a lack of tea drinking was easy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, indeed!” said Mr White, turning to the other Auditors. “Is that not true?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that is not true. Indeed!” said Mr Green desperately.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh?” said Dr Hopkins. “I did not know there was any religion that forbade tea.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed!” said Mr White. Lady LeJean could almost feel his mind racing. “It is a… yes, it is a drink of the… correct… it is a drink of the… extremely bad negatively regarded gods. It is a… correct… it is a commandment of our religion to… yes… to shun ginger biscuits also.” There was sweat on his forehead. For an Auditor, this was genius-level creativity. “Also,” he went on slowly, as if reading the words off some page invisible to everyone else, “our religion… correct!… our religion demands that the clock be started now! For… who may know when the hour may be?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Despite herself, Lady LeJean nearly applauded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who indeed?” said Dr Hopkins. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I, I absolutely agree,” said Jeremy, who had been staring at Lady LeJean. “I don't understand who you… why there's all this fuss… I don't understand why… oh, dear… I'm having a headache…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Dr Hopkins spilled his tea because of the speed with which he got up and reached into his coat pocket.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“AhitsohappensIwaspassingtheapothecaryonmywayhere—” he began, all in one breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I feel it's not the time to start the clock,” said Lady LeJean, edging herself along the desk. The hammer was still invitingly there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm seeing those little flashes of light, Dr Hopkins,” said Jeremy urgently, staring into the middle distance.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not the flashes of light! Not the flashes of light!” said Dr Hopkins. He grabbed a teaspoon off Igor's tray, stared at it, threw it over his shoulder, tipped the tea out of a cup, opened the bottle of blue medicine by smashing the top off on the edge of the bench, and poured a cupful, spilling quite a lot of it in his hurry.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The hammer was inches away from her ladyship's hand. She didn't dare look round, but she could <em class="calibre9">sense </em>it there. While the Auditors stared at the trembling Jeremy, she let her fingers walk across the bench. She wouldn't even have to move. A brisk overarm throw should do it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She saw Dr Hopkins try to put the cup to Jeremy's lips. The boy put his hands over his face and elbowed the cup out of the way, spilling the medicine across the floor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then Lady LeJean's fingers were grasping the handle. She brought her hand round and hurled the hammer directly at the clock.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>

      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The war was going badly for the weaker side. Their positioning was wrong, their tactics ragged, their strategy hopeless. The Red army advanced across the whole front, dismembering the scurrying remnant of the collapsing Black battalions.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was room for only <em class="calibre9">one </em>anthill on this lawn…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death found War down among the grass blades. He admired attention to detail. War was in full armour, too, but the human heads he normally had tied to his saddle had been replaced by ant heads, feelers and all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">DO THEY NOTICE YOU, DO YOU THINK? he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I doubt it,” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NEVERTHELESS, IF THEY DID, I'M SURE THEY WOULD APPRECIATE IT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ha! Only decent theatre of war around these days,” said War. “That's what I like about ants. The buggers don't learn, what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT HAS BEEN RATHER PEACEFUL OF LATE, I AGREE, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Peaceful?” said War. “Ha! I may as well change m'name to ‘Police Action’, or ‘Negotiated Settlement’! Remember the old days? Warriors used to froth at the mouth! Arms and legs bouncing in all directions! Great times, eh?” He leaned across and slapped Death on the back. “I'll bag' em and you tag' em, what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This looked hopeful, Death thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">TALKING OF THE OLD DAYS, he said carefully, I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE TRADITION OF RIDING OUT?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War gave him a puzzled look. “Mind's a blank on that one, old boy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I SENT OUT THE CALL.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can't say it rings a bell…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">APOCALYPSE? said Death. END OF THE WORLD?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War continued to stare. “Definitely knocking, old chap, but no one's home. And talking of home…” War looked around at the twitching remains of the recent slaughter. “Spot of lunch?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Around them the forest of grass grew shorter and smaller until it was, indeed, no more than grass, and became the lawn outside a house.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was an ancient long-house. Where else would War live? But Death saw ivy growing over the roof. He remembered when War would never have allowed anything like that, and a little worm of worry began to gnaw.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War hung up his helmet as he entered, and once he would have kept it on. And the benches around the fire pit would have been crowded with warriors, and the air would have been thick with beer and sweat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Brought an old friend back, dear,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs War was preparing something on the modern black iron kitchen range which, Death saw, had been installed in the fire pit, with shiny pipes extending up to the hole in the roof. She gave Death the kind of nod a wife gives a man whom her husband has, despite previous warnings, unexpectedly brought back from the pub.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're having rabbit,” she said, and added in the voice of one who has been put upon and will extract payment later, “I'm <em class="calibre9">sure </em>I can make it stretch to three.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War's big red face wrinkled. “Do I like rabbit?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, dear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought I liked beef.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, dear. Beef gives you wind.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh.” War sighed. “Any chance of onions?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't like onions, dear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Because of your stomach, dear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War smiled awkwardly at Death. “It's rabbit,” he said. “Erm… dear, do I ride out for Apocalypses?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs War took the lid off a saucepan and prodded viciously at something inside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, dear,” she said firmly. “You always come down with a cold.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought I rather, er, sort of <em class="calibre9">liked </em>that kind of thing…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, dear. You don't.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Despite himself, Death was fascinated. He had never come across the idea of keeping your memory inside someone else's head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Perhaps I would like a beer?” War ventured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't like beer, dear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, it brings on your trouble.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. Uh, how do I feel about brandy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't like brandy, dear. You like your special oat drink with the vitamins.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said War mournfully. “I'd forgotten I liked that.” He looked sheepishly at Death. “It's quite nice,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU, said Death, IN PRIVATE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War looked puzzled. “Do I like wo—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IN <em class="calibre9">PRIVATE</em>, PLEASE, Death thundered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs War turned and gave Death a disdainful look. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I understand, I <em class="calibre9">quite </em>understand,” she said haughtily. “But don't you dare say anything to bring on his acid, that's all I shall say.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mrs War had been a Valkyrie once, Death remembered. It was another reason to be extremely careful on the battlefield.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've never been tempted by the prospect of marriage, old man?” said War, when she'd gone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. IN NO WAY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why not?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death was nonplussed. It was like asking a brick wall what it thought of dentistry. As a question, it made no sense.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I HAVE BEEN TO SEE THE OTHER TWO, he said, ignoring it. FAMINE DOESN'T CARE AND PESTILENCE IS FRIGHTENED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The two of us, against the Auditors?” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">RIGHT IS ON OUR SIDE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Speaking as War,” said War, “I'd hate to tell you what happens to very small armies that have Right on their side.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I HAVE SEEN YOU FIGHT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My old right arm isn't what it was…” War murmured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU ARE IMMORTAL. YOU ARE NOT ILL, said Death, but he could see the worried, slightly hunted look in Wars eyes and knew that there was only one way this was going to go.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To be human was to change, Death realized. The Horsemen… were horse<em class="calibre9">men</em>. Men had wished upon them a certain shape, a certain form. And, just like the gods, and the Tooth Fairy, and the Hogfather, their shape had changed them. They would never <em class="calibre9">be </em>human, but they had caught aspects of humanity as though they were some kind of disease.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Because the point was that nothing, <em class="calibre9">nothing</em>, had one aspect and one aspect alone. Men would envisage a being called Famine, but once they gave him arms and legs and eyes, that meant he had to have a brain. That meant he'd think. And a brain can't think about plagues of locusts <em class="calibre9">all </em>the time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Emergent behaviour again. Complications always crept in. Everything changed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THANK GOODNESS, thought Death, THAT I AM COMPLETELY UNCHANGED AND EXACTLY THE SAME AS I EVER WAS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then there was one.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The hammer stopped, halfway across the room. Mr White walked over and picked it out of the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really, your ladyship,” he said. “You think we don't watch you? You, the Igor, make the clock ready!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Igor looked from him to Lady LeJean and back. “I only take orderth from Marthter Jeremy, thank you,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The world will end if you start that clock!” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What a foolish idea,” said Mr White. “We laugh at it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hahaha,” said the other Auditors obediently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">don't</em> need medicine!” Jeremy shouted, pushing Dr Hopkins out of the way. “And I don't need people to tell me what to do. Shut up!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the silence, thunder grumbled in the clouds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” said Jeremy, more calmly. “Now, I hope I am a rational man, and I shall approach this rationally. A clock is a measuring device. I have built the perfect clock, my lady. I mean ladies. And gentlemen. It will revolutionize timekeeping.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached up and moved the hands of the clock to almost one o'clock. Then he reached down, gripped the pendulum, and set it swinging.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The world continued to exist.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You see? The universe doesn't stop even for <em class="calibre9">my </em>clock,” Jeremy went on. He folded his hands and sat down. “Watch,” he said calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clock ticked gently. Then something rattled in the machinery around it, and the big green glass tubes of acid began to sizzle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, nothing seems to have happened,” said Dr Hopkins. “That's a blessing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Sparks crackled around the lightning rod positioned above the clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is just making a path for the lightning,” said Jeremy happily. “We send a little lightning up, and a lot more comes back—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Things were moving inside the clock. There was a sound best represented as <em class="calibre9">fizzle</em>, and greenish-blue light filled the case.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, the cascade has initialized,” said Jeremy. “As a little exercise, the, ah, more <em class="calibre9">traditional </em>pendulum clock has been slaved to the Big Clock, you'll see, so that every second it will be readjusted to the correct time.” He smiled, and one cheek twitched. “Some day all clocks will be like this,” he said, and added, “While I normally hate such an imprecise term as ‘any second now’, nevertheless I—”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a fight going on in the square. In the strange colours involved in the time-slicing state known as Zimmerman's Valley, it was picked out in shades of light blue.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">By the look of it, a couple of watchmen were trying to take on a gang. One man was airborne, and hung there without support. Another had fired a crossbow directly at one of the watchmen; the arrow was nailed unmoving in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang examined it curiously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to touch it, aren't you?” said a voice behind Lobsang. “You're just going to reach out and touch it, despite everything I've told you. Pay attention to the damn sky!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was smoking nervously. When it got a few inches away from his body, the smoke went rigid in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you <em class="calibre9">sure </em>you can't feel where it is?” he snapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's all round us, Sweeper. We're so close, it… it's like trying to see the wood when you're standing under the trees!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, this is the Street of Cunning Artificers and that's the Guild of Clockmakers over there,” said Lu-Tze. “I don't dare go inside if it's this close, not until we're certain.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What about the University?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Wizards aren't mad enough to try it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to try and race the lightning?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's doable, if we start from here in the Valley. Lightning ain't as quick as people think.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are we waiting to see a little pointy bit of lightning coming out of a cloud?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! Kids today, where <em class="calibre9">do </em>they get their education? The first stroke is from the ground to the air, lad. That makes a nice hole in the air for the main lightning to come down. Look for the glow. We've got to be giving the road plenty of sandal by the time it reaches the clouds. You holding up okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I could go on like this all day,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't try it.” Lu-Tze scanned the sky again. “Maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's just a storm. Sooner or later you get—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stopped. One look at Lobsang's face was enough.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“O-kay,” said the sweeper slowly. “Just give me a direction. Point if you can't speak.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang dropped to his knees, hands rising to his head. “I don't know… don't know…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Silvery light rose over the city, a few streets away. Lu-Tze grabbed the boy's elbow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Come on, lad. On your feet. Faster than lightning, eh? Okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah… yeah, okay…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You can do it, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang blinked. He could see the glass house again, stretching away as a pale outline overlaid the city.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Clock,” he said thickly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Run, boy, run!” shouted Lu-Tze. “And don't stop for <em class="calibre9">anything</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang plunged forward, and found it hard. Time moved aside for him, sluggishly at first, as his legs pumped. With every step he pushed himself faster and faster, the landscape changing colours again as the world slowed even further.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was another stitch in time, the sweeper had said. Another valley, even closer to the null point. Insofar as he could think at all, Lobsang hoped he would reach it soon. His body felt as though it would fly apart; he could feel his bones <em class="calibre9">creaking</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The glow ahead was halfway to the iron-heavy clouds now, but he'd reached a crossroads and he could see it was rising from a house halfway down the street.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He turned to look for the sweeper, and saw the man yards behind him, mouth open, a statue falling forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang turned, concentrated, let time speed up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached Lu-Tze and caught him before he hit the ground. There was blood coming from the old man's ears.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't do it, lad,” the sweeper mumbled. “Get on! Get on!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can do it! It's like running downhill!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not for me it ain't!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't just leave you here like this!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Save us from heroes! Get that bloody clock!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang hesitated. The downstroke was already emerging from the clouds, a drifting, glowing <em class="calibre9">spike</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He ran. The lightning was falling towards a shop, a few buildings away. He could see a big clock hanging over its window.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He pushed against the flow of time ever further, and it yielded. But the lightning had reached the iron pole atop the building.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The window was closer than the door. He lowered his head and jumped through it, the glass shattering around him and then freezing in mid-air, clocks pinwheeling off the display and stopping as if caught in invisible amber.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was another door ahead of him. He grabbed the knob and pulled, feeling the terrible resistance of a slab of wood urged to move at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was barely open a few inches when he saw, beyond, the slow ooze of lightning run down the rod and into the heart of the big clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clock struck one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Time stopped.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Ti—</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr Soak the dairyman was washing bottles at the sink when the air dimmed and the water solidified.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stared at it for a moment and then, with the manner of a man trying an experiment, held the bottle over the stone floor and let it go.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It remained hanging in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Dammit,” he said. “Another idiot with a clock, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">What he did then was not usual dairy practice. He walked into the centre of the room and made a few passes in the air with his hands.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air brightened. The water splashed. The bottle smashed although, when Ronnie turned round and waved a hand at it, the glass slivers ran together again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then Ronnie Soak sighed and went into the cream-settling room. Large wide bowls stretched away into the distance and, if Ronnie had ever allowed another to notice this, the distance contained far more distance than is ever found in a normal building.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Show me,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The surface of the nearest bowl of milk became a mirror, and then began to show pictures…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie went back into the dairy, took his peaked cap off its hook by the door, and crossed the courtyard to the stable. The sky overhead was a sullen, unmoving grey as he emerged, leading his horse. The horse was black, glistening with condition, and there was this about it that was odd: it shone as though it was illuminated by a red light. Redness spangled off its shoulders and flanks, even under the greyness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And even when it was harnessed to the cart it didn't look like any kind of horse that should be hitched to any kind of wagon, but people never noticed this and, again, Ronnie took care to make sure that they didn't.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The cart gleamed with white paint, picked out here and there with a fresh green.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The wording on the side declared, proudly: </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">
        <div class="paragraph">

      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Perhaps it was odd that people never asked, “Established <em class="calibre9">when</em>, exactly?” If they ever had, the answer would have had to be quite complicated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie opened the gates to the yard and, milk crates rattling, set out into the timeless moment. It was terrible, he thought, the way things conspired against the small businessman.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang Ludd awoke to a little clicking, spinning sound.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He was in darkness, but it yielded reluctantly to his hand. It felt like velvet, and it was. He'd rolled under one of the display cabinets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a vibration in the small of his back. He reached around gingerly, and realized that the portable Procrastinator was revolving in its cage.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">How did it go, now? He was living on borrowed time. He'd got maybe an hour, perhaps a lot less. But he could slice it, so…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No. Something told him that trying that would be a really terminal idea with time stored in a device made by Qu. The mere thought made him feel that his skin was inches from a universe full of razorblades.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So… one hour, perhaps a lot less. But you could rewind a spinner, right?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No. The handle was at the back. You could rewind <em class="calibre9">someone else's </em>spinner. Thank you, Qu, and your experimental models.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Could you take it off, then? No. The harness was part of it. Without it, different parts of your body would be travelling at different speeds. The effect would probably be rather like freezing a human body solid, and then pushing it down a flight of stone stairs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Open the box with the crowbar that you will find inside…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a green-blue glow through the crack in the door. He took a step towards it, and heard the spinner suddenly pick up speed. That meant it was shedding more time, and that was <em class="calibre9">bad </em>when you had an hour, perhaps a lot less.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He took a step away from the door and the Procrastinator settled back into its routine clicking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">So…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was out in the street and <em class="calibre9">he </em>had a spinner and that should have cut in automatically, too. In this timeless world, he was going to be the only person who could turn a handle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The glass that he had broken in his leap through the window had opened around the hole like a great sparkling flower. He reached out to touch a piece. It moved as though alive, cut his finger, and then dropped towards the ground, stopping only when it fell out of the field around his body.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Don't touch people, Lu-Tze had said. Don't touch arrows. Don't touch things that were moving, that was the rule. But the glass—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–but the glass, in normal time, had been flying through the air. It'd still have that energy, wouldn't it?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He eased himself carefully around the glass, and opened the front door of the shop. The wood moved very slowly, fighting against the enormous speed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was not in the street. But there was something new, hovering in the air just a few inches above the ground right where the old man had been. It had not been there before.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Someone with their <em class="calibre9">own </em>portable time had been here, and dropped this, and had moved on before it reached the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a small glass jar, coloured blue by temporal effects. Now… how much energy could it have? Lobsang cupped his hand and gingerly brought it underneath and up, and there was a tingle and a sudden feeling of weight as the spinners field claimed it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Now </em>its true colours came back. The jar was a milky pink or, rather, clear glass that looked pink because of the contents. The paper lid was covered with badly printed pictures of unbelievably flawless strawberries, surrounding some ornate lettering which read: <strong class="calibre12">R</strong>ONALD <strong class="calibre12">S</strong>OAK, <strong class="calibre12">H</strong>YGIENIC <strong class="calibre12">D</strong>AIRYMAN. <strong class="calibre12">S</strong>TRAWBERRY <strong class="calibre12">Y</strong>OGHURT “<strong class="calibre12">F</strong>RESH <strong class="calibre12">A</strong>S <strong class="calibre12">T</strong>HE <strong class="calibre12">M</strong>ORNING <strong class="calibre12">D</strong>EW.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Soak? He <em class="calibre9">knew </em>the name! The man had delivered milk to the Guild! Good fresh milk, too, not the watery, green-tinted stuff the other dairies supplied. Very reliable, everyone said. But, reliable or not, he was just a milkman… all right, just a <em class="calibre9">very good </em>milkman… and if time had stopped, then why—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked around desperately. The people and carts that thronged the street were still there. No one had moved. No one <em class="calibre9">could </em>move.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But something <em class="calibre9">was </em>running along the gutter. It looked like a rat in a black robe, running along on its hind legs. It looked up at Lobsang, and he saw that it had a skull rather than a head. As skulls went, it was quite a cheerful one.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The word SQUEAK manifested itself inside his brain without bothering to go via his ears. Then the rat hopped onto the pavement and scampered down an alley.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang followed it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A moment later someone behind him grabbed him by the neck. He went to break the lock, and realized how much he'd relied on slicing when he was fought. Besides, the person behind him had a very strong grip indeed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just want to make sure you don't do anything silly,” it said. It was a female voice. “What is this thing on your back?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who are—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The protocol in these matters,” said the voice, “is that the person with the killer neckgrip asks the questions.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, it's a Procrastinator. Er, it stores time. Who—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh dear, there you go again. What is your name?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lobsang. Lobsang Ludd. Look, could you wind me up, please? It's urgent.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Certainly. Lobsang Ludd, you are thoughtless and impulsive and deserve to die a stupid and pointless death.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you are also rather slow on the uptake. You are referring to this handle?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I'm running out of time. <em class="calibre9">Now </em>can I ask who you are?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Miss Susan. Hold still.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He heard, behind him, the incredibly welcome sound of the Procrastinators clockwork being rewound.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Miss Susan?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's what most people I know call me. Now, I'm going to let you go. I will add that trying anything stupid will be counterproductive. Besides, I'm the only person in the world right now who might be inclined to twiddle your handle again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The pressure was released. Lobsang turned slowly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Susan was a slightly built young woman, dressed severely all in black. Her hair stood out around her head like an aura, white-blond with one black streak. But the most striking thing about her was… was everything, Lobsang realized, everything from her expression to the way she stood. Some people fade into the background. Miss Susan faded into the foreground. She stood out. Everything she stood in front of became nothing more than background.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Finished?” she said. “Seen everything?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry. Have <em class="calibre9">you </em>seen an old man? Dressed a bit like me? With one of these on his back?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. Now it's my turn. Have you got rhythm?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan rolled her eyes. “All right. Do you have music?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not on me, no!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you certainly haven't got a girl,” said Susan. “I saw Old Man Trouble go past a few minutes ago. It'd be a good idea if you don't bump into him, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And is <em class="calibre9">he </em>likely to have taken my friend?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I doubt it. And Old Man Trouble is more an ‘it’ than a ‘he’. Anyway, there's far worse than him around right now. Even the bogeymen have gone to ground.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, time has stopped, right?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So how can you be here talking to me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not what you might call a creature of time,” said Susan. “I work in it, but I don't have to live there. There are a few of us about.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Like this Old Man Trouble you mentioned?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right. And the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, people like that.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought they were mythical?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So?” Susan glanced out of the mouth of the alley again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you're not?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I take it you didn't stop the clock,” said Miss Susan, looking up and down the street.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. I was… too late. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone back to help Lu-Tze.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sorry? You were dashing to prevent the end of the world but you stopped to help some old man? You… <em class="calibre9">hero</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, I wouldn't say that I was a—” And then Lobsang stopped. She hadn't said “You hero” in the tone of voice of “You star”; it had been the tone in which people say “You idiot.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I see a lot of your sort,” Susan went on. “Heroes have a very strange grasp of elementary maths, you know. If you'd smashed the clock <em class="calibre9">before </em>it struck, everything would have been fine. Now the world has stopped and we've been invaded and we're probably all going to die, just because you stopped to help someone. I mean, very worthy and all that, but very, very… human.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She used the word as if she meant it to mean “silly”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean you need cool calculating bastards to save the world, do you?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The cool calculation does help, I must admit,” said Susan. “Now, shall we go and look at this clock?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why? The damage is done now. If we smash it, it'll only make things worse. Besides, uh, the spinner started to run wild and I, er, I felt—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Cautious,” said Susan. “Good. Caution is sensible. But there's something I want to check.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang tried to pull himself together. This strange woman had the air of someone who knew exactly what she was doing—who knew exactly what <em class="calibre9">everyone </em>was doing—and, besides, what alternative did he have? Then he remembered the yoghurt pot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Does this mean anything?” he said. “I'm certain it was dropped in the street after time stopped.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She took the pot and examined it. “Oh,” she said casually. “Ronnie's been around, has he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ronnie?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, we all know Ronnie.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's that supposed to mean?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Let's just say if <em class="calibre9">he </em>found your friend then your friend is going to be okay. Probably okay. More okay than he would be if just about anything else found him, at least. Look, this is not a time when you should be worrying about one person. Cold calculation, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stepped out into the street. Lobsang followed. Susan walked as if she owned the street. She scanned every alley and doorway, but not like a potential victim apprehensive of attackers. It seemed to Lobsang that she was disappointed to find nothing dangerous in the shadows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She reached the shop, stepped inside, and paused for a moment to regard the floating flower of broken glass. Her expression suggested that she considered it to be a perfectly normal kind of thing to find, and had seen far more interesting things. Then she walked on and stopped at the inner door. There was still a glow from the crack, but it was dimmer now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Settling down,” she said. “Shouldn't be too bad… but there's two people in here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Wait, I'll open the door. And be careful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The door moved very slowly. Lobsang stepped into the workshop after the girl. The spinner began to speed up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clock glowed in the middle of the floor, painful to look at.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But he stared nevertheless. “It's… it's just as I imagined it,” he said. “It's the way to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't go near it,” said Susan. “It's uncertain death, believe me. <em class="calibre9">Do </em>pay attention.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang blinked. The last couple of thoughts didn't seem to have belonged to him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What did you say?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I said it's uncertain death.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is that worse than certain death?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Much. Watch.” Susan picked up a hammer that was lying on the floor and poked it gently towards the clock. It vibrated in her hand when she brought it closer, and she swore under her breath as it was dragged from her fingers and vanished. Just before it did there was a brief, contracting ring around the clock that might have been something like a hammer would be if you rolled it very flat and bent it into a circle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Have you any idea why that happened?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nor have I. Now imagine that you were the hammer. Uncertain death, see?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked at the two frozen people. One was medium-sized and had all the right number of appendages to qualify as a member of the human race, and so therefore probably had to be given the benefit of the doubt. It was staring at the clock. So was the other figure, which was that of a middle-aged, sheep-faced man still holding a cup of tea and, as far as Lobsang could make out, a biscuit.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The one who wouldn't win a beauty contest even if he was the only entrant is an Igor,” said Susan. “The other one is Dr Hopkins of the Clockmakers' Guild here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So we know who built the clock, at least,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think so. Mr Hopkins's workshop is several streets away. And he makes novelty watches for a rather strange kind of discerning customer. It's his speciality.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then the… Igor must've built it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good grief, no! Igors are professional servants. They never work for themselves.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You seem to know a lot,” said Lobsang, as Susan circled the clock like a wrestler trying to spy out a hold.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” she said, without turning her head. “I do. The first clock broke. This one's holding. Whoever designed it was a genius.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An evil genius?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's hard to say. I can't see any signs.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What kind of signs?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, ‘Hahaha!!!!!’ painted on the side would be a definite clue, don't you think?” she said, rolling her eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm in your way, am I?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, not at all,” said Susan, turning her attention to the workbench. “Well, there's nothing here. I suppose he could have set a timer. A sort of alarm clock—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stopped. She picked up a length of rubber hosepipe that was coiled on a hook by the glass jars and looked hard at it. Then she tossed it into a corner and stared at it as if she had never seen anything like it before.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't say a word,” she said quietly. “They have some very acute senses. Just ease back among those big glass vats behind you and try to look inconspicuous. And do it NOW.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The last word had odd harmonics to it and Lobsang felt his legs begin to move almost without his conscious control.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The door moved a little and a man came in.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">What was strange about the face, Lobsang thought afterwards, was how unmemorable it was. He'd never seen a face so lacking in anything to mention. It had a nose and mouth and eyes, and they were all quite flawless, but somehow they didn't make up a <em class="calibre9">face</em>. They were just parts that made no proper whole. If they became anything at all it was the face of a statue, good looking but without anything looking <em class="calibre9">out </em>of it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Slowly, like someone who had to <em class="calibre9">think </em>about his muscles, the man turned to look at Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang felt himself bunch up to slice time. The spinner groaned a warning on his back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's about enough, I think,” said Susan, stepping forward. The man was spun around. An elbow was jabbed into his stomach and then the palm of her hand caught him so hard under his chin that he was lifted off the floor and slammed against the wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As he fell, Susan hit him on the head with a wrench.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We might as well be going,” she said, as if she'd just shuffled some paper that had been untidy. “Nothing more for us here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre9">killed </em>him!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Certainly. He's not a human being. I have… a sense about these things. It's sort of inherited. Besides, go and pick up the hose. Go on.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Since she was still holding the wrench, Lobsang did so. Or tried to do so. The coil she'd flung into the corner was knotted and tangled like rubber spaghetti.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Malignancy, my grandfather calls it,” said Susan. “The local hostility of things towards non-things always increases when there's an Auditor about. They can't help it. The hosepipe test is very reliable in the field, according to a rat I know.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rat, thought Lobsang, but he <em class="calibre9">said</em>: “What's an Auditor?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And they have no sense of colour. They don't understand it. Look how he's dressed. Grey suit, grey shirt, grey shoes, grey cravat, grey <em class="calibre9">everything</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… er… perhaps it was just someone trying to be very cool?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You think so? No loss there, then,” said Susan. “Anyway, you're wrong. Watch.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The body was disintegrating. It was a fast and quite ungory process, a sort of dry evaporation. It simply became floating dust, which expanded away and vanished. But the last few handfuls formed, just for a few seconds, a familiar shape. That, too, vanished, with the merest whisper of a scream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That was a <em class="calibre9">dhlang</em>!” he said. “An evil spirit! The peasants down in the valleys hang up charms against them! But I thought they were just a superstition!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, they're a substition,” said Susan. “I mean they're real, but hardly anyone really believes in them. Mostly everyone believes in things that aren't real. Something very strange is going on. These things are all over the place, and they've got <em class="calibre9">bodies</em>. That's not right. We've got to find the person who built the clock—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And, er, what are <em class="calibre9">you</em>, Miss Susan?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me? I'm… a schoolteacher.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She followed his gaze to the wrench that she still held in her hand, and shrugged.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It can get pretty rough at break time, can it?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was an overpowering smell of milk.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze sat bolt upright.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a large room, and he had been placed on a slab in the middle of it. By the feel of the surface, it was sheeted with metal. There were churns stacked along the wall, and big metal bowls ranged beside a sink the size of a bath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Under the milk smell were many others—disinfectant, well-scrubbed wood and a distant odour of horses.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Footsteps approached. Lu-Tze lay back hurriedly and shut his eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He heard someone enter the room. They were whistling under their breath, and they had to be a man, because no woman in Lu-Tze's long experience had ever whistled in that warbling, hissing way. The whistling approached the slab, stayed still for a moment, then turned away and headed for the sink. It was replaced by the sound of a pump handle being operated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze half opened one eye.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The man standing at the sink was quite short, so that the standard-issue blue-and-white striped apron he wore almost reached the floor. He appeared to be washing bottles.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze swung his legs off the slab, moving with a stealthiness that made the average <em class="calibre9">ninja </em>sound like a brass band, and let his sandals gently touch the floor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Feeling better?” said the man, without turning his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, er, yes. Fine,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought, here's a little bald monk sort of a fellow,” said the man, holding a bottle up to the light to inspect it. “With a wind-up thing on his back, and down on his luck. Fancy a cup of tea? Kettle's on. I've got yak butter.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yak? Am I still in Ankh-Morpork?” Lu-Tze looked down at a rack of ladles beside him. The man still hadn't looked round.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hmm. Interestin' question,” said the bottle-washer. “You could say you're <em class="calibre9">sort </em>of in Ankh-Morpork. No to yak milk? I can get cow's milk, or goat, sheep, camel, llama, horse, cat, dog, dolphin, whale or alligator if you prefer.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? Alligators don't give milk!” said Lu-Tze, grasping the biggest ladle. It made no noise as it came off its hook.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't say it was easy.” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper got a good grip. “What is this place, friend?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You are in… the dairy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The man at the sink said the last word as if it was as portentous as “castle of dread”, placed another bottle on the draining board, and, still with his back to Lu-Tze, held up a hand. All the fingers were folded except for the middle digit, which was extended.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know what this is, monk?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's not a friendly gesture, friend.” The ladle felt good and heavy. Lu-Tze had used much worse weapons than this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, a superficial interpretation. You are an old man, monk. I can see the centuries on you. Tell me what this is, and know what I am.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The coldness in the dairy got a little colder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's your middle finger,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pah!” said the man.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pah?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, pah! You have a brain. Use it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, it was good of you to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know the secret wisdoms that everyone seeks, monk.” The bottle-washer paused. “No, I even suspect that you know the explicit wisdoms, the ones hidden in plain view, which practically no one looks for. Who am I?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stared at the solitary finger. The wall's of the dairy faded. The cold grew deeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">His mind raced, and the librarian of memory took over.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This wasn't a normal place, that wasn't a normal man: A finger. One finger. One of the five digits on a—One of five. One of <em class="calibre9">Five</em>. Faint echoes of an ancient legend signalled his attention.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One from five is four.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And one left over.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze very carefully hung the ladle back on its hook.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One from Five,” he said. “The Fifth of Four.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There we are. I could see you were educated.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You were… you were the one who left before they became famous?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… this is a dairy, and you're washing bottles!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well? I had to do something with my time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… you were the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse!” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I bet you can't remember my name.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze hesitated. “No,” he said. “I don't think I ever heard it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fifth Horseman turned round. His eyes were black. Completely black. Shiny, and black, and without any whites at all.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My name,” said the Fifth Horseman, “is…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My name is Ronnie.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Timelessness grew like ice. Waves froze on the sea. Birds were pinned to the air. The world went still.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But not quiet. There was a sound like a finger running around the rim of a very large glass.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Come <em class="calibre9">on</em>,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can't you hear it?” said Lobsang, stopping.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it's no use to us—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She pushed Lobsang back into the shadows. The robed grey shape of an Auditor appeared in the air halfway down the street, and began to spin. The air around it filled with dust, which became a whirling cylinder, which became, slightly unsteady on its feet, something that looked human.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It rocked backwards and forwards for a moment. It raised its hands slowly and looked at them, turning them this way and that. Then it marched away, purposefully. Further along the street it was joined by another one, emerging from an alley.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This really isn't like them,” said Susan, as the pair turned a corner. “They're up to something. Let's follow them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What about Lu-Tze?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What about him? How old did you say he was?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He says he's eight hundred years old.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hard to kill, then. Ronnie's safe enough if you're alert and don't argue. Come on.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She set off along the streets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors were joined by others, weaving through the silent carts and motionless people and along the street towards, as it turned out, Sator Square, one of the biggest open spaces in the city. It was market day. Silent, motionless figures thronged the stalls. But, amongst them, there were scurrying grey shapes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's hundreds of them,” said Susan. “All human-shaped… and it looks like they're having a meeting.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White was losing patience. Up until now, he had never been aware that he had any, because, if anything, he had been <em class="calibre9">all </em>patience. But now he could feel it evaporating. It was a strange, hot sensation in his head. And how could a thought be <em class="calibre9">hot</em>?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The mass of incarnated Auditors watched him nervously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am Mr White!” he said to the luckless new Auditor that had been brought before him, and shuddered with the astonishment of using that singular word and surviving. “You <em class="calibre9">cannot </em>be Mr White also. It would be a matter of confusion.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But we are running out of colours,” said Mr Violet, intervening.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That cannot be the case,” said Mr White. “There is an infinite number of colours.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But there are not that many names,” said Miss Taupe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is not possible. A colour must have a name.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We can find only one hundred and three names for green before the colour becomes noticeably either blue or yellow,” said Miss Crimson.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But the shades are endless!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless, the names are not.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is a problem that must be solved. Add it to the list, Miss Brown. We must name every possible shade.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the female Auditors looked startled. “I cannot remember all the things,” she said. “Nor do I understand why you are giving orders.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Apart from the renegade, I have the greatest seniority as an incarnate.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only by a matter of seconds,” said Miss Brown.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is immaterial. Seniority is seniority. This is a fact.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a fact. Auditors respected facts. And it was also a fact, Mr White knew, that there were now more than seven hundred Auditors walking rather awkwardly around the city.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White had put a stop to the relentless increase in incarnations as more and more of his fellows rushed into the trouble spot. It was too dangerous. The renegade had demonstrated, he pointed out, that the human shape forced the mind to think in a certain troublesome way. The utmost caution was necessary. This was a fact. Only those with a proven ability to survive the process should be allowed to incarnate and complete the work. This was a fact.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Auditors respected facts. At least until now. Miss Brown took a step back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nevertheless,” she said, “being here is dangerous. It is my view that we should discarnate.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White found his body replying by itself. It let out a breath of air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And leave things unknown?” he said. “Things that are unknown are dangerous. We are learning much.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What we are learning makes no sense,” said Miss Brown.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The more we learn, the more sense it will make. There is nothing we cannot understand,” said Mr White.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I do not understand why it is that I now perceive a desire to bring my hand in sharp contact with your face,” said Miss Brown.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly my point,” said Mr White. “You do not understand it, and therefore it is dangerous. Perform the act, and we will know more.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She hit him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He raised his hand to his cheek.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Unbidden thoughts of avoidance of repetition are engendered,” he said. “Also heat. Remarkably, the body does indeed appear to do some thinking on its own behalf.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“For my part,” said Miss Brown, “the unbidden thoughts are of satisfaction coupled with apprehension.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Already we learn more about humans,” said Mr White.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To what end?” said Miss Brown, whose sensations of apprehension were increasing at the sight of the contorted expression on Mr White's face. “For our purposes, they are no longer a factor. Time has ended. They are fossils. The skin under one of your eyes is twitching.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You are guilty of inappropriate thought,” said Mr White. “They exist. Therefore we must study them in every detail. I wish to try a further experiment. My eye is functioning perfectly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He took an axe from a market stall. Miss Brown took another step back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Unbidden thoughts of apprehension increase markedly,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yet this is a mere lump of metal on a piece of wood,” said Mr White, hefting the axe. “We, who have seen the hearts of stars. We, who have watched worlds burn. We, who have seen space tormented. What is there about this axe that could cause concern to <em class="calibre9">us</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He swung. It was a clumsy blow and the human neck is a lot tougher than people believe, but Miss Brown's neck exploded into coloured motes and she collapsed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White looked around at the nearest Auditors, who all stepped back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is there anyone else who wishes to try the experiment?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a chorus of hasty refusals.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good,” said Mr White. “Already we are learning a great deal!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“He chopped her head off!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't shout! And keep <em class="calibre9">your </em>head down!” Susan hissed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But he—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think she knows! Anyway, it's an it. And so's it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's going on?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan drew back into the shadows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not… <em class="calibre9">entirely </em>sure,” she said, “but I think they've tried to make themselves human bodies. Pretty good copies, too. And now… they're acting human.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you call <em class="calibre9">that </em>acting human?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan gave Lobsang a sad look. “You don't get out much, do you? My grandfather says that if an intelligent creature takes a human shape, it starts to <em class="calibre9">think </em>human. Form defines function.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That was the action of an intelligent creature?” said Lobsang, still shocked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not only doesn't get out much, also doesn't read history,” said Susan glumly. “Do you know about the curse of the werewolves?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Isn't being a werewolf curse enough?” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They don't think so. But if they stay wolf-shaped for too long, they stay a wolf,” said Susan. “A wolf is a very strong… form, you see? Even though the mind is human, the wolf creeps in through the noses and the ears and the paws. Know about witches?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We, er, stole the broomstick of one of them to get here,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? Bit of luck for you that the world's ended, then,” said Susan. “Anyway, some of the best witches have this trick they call Borrowing. They can get into the mind of an animal. Very useful. But the trick is to know when to pullout. Be a duck for too long and a duck you'll stay. A bright duck, maybe, with some odd memories, but still a duck.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The poet Hoha once dreamed he was a butterfly, and then he awoke and said, ‘Am I a man who dreamed he was a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming he is a man?’” said Lobsang, trying to join in.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said Susan briskly. “And which was he?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? Well… who knows?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did he write his poems?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“With a brush, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He didn't flap around making information-rich patterns in the air or laying eggs on cabbage leaves?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No one ever mentioned it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then he was probably a man,” said Susan. “Interesting, but it doesn't move us on a lot. Except you could say that the Auditors are dreaming that they're human, and the dream is real. And they've got no imagination. Just like my grandfather, really. They can create a perfect copy of anything, but they can't make anything that's <em class="calibre9">new</em>. So what I <em class="calibre9">think </em>is happening is that they're finding out what being human really means.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Which is?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That you're not as much in control as you think.” She took another careful look at the crowd in the square. “Do you know anything about the person who built the clock?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Me? No. Well, not really…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then how did you find the place?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze thought this was where the clock was being built.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? Not a bad guess. You even got the right house.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I, er, it was me that found the house. It, er, I knew that was where I should be. Does that sound silly?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes. With twinkly bells and bluebirds on it. But it might be true, too. <em class="calibre9">I </em>always know where I should be, too. And where should you be now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a minute,” said Lobsang. “Who <em class="calibre9">are </em>you? Time has stopped, the world is given over to… fairy tales and monsters, and there's a <em class="calibre9">schoolteacher </em>walking around?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Best kind of person to have,” said Susan. “We don't like silliness. Anyway, I told you… I've inherited certain talents.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Like living outside time?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's one of them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a weird talent for a schoolteacher!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good for marking, though,” said Susan calmly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you actually human?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! As human as you are. I won't say I haven't got a few skeletons in the family closet, though.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was something about the way she said it…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That wasn't just a figure of speech, was it,” said Lobsang flatly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, not really,” said Susan. “That thing on your back… What happens when it stops spinning?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll run out of time, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. So the fact that it slowed down and stopped back there when that Auditor practised its axmanship isn't a factor, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's not turning?” Panicking, Lobsang tried to reach round to the small of his back, spinning himself in the effort.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It looks as though you have a hidden talent,” said Susan, leaning against the wall and grinning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please! Wind me up again!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All right. You are a—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">That wasn't very funny the first time</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's all right, I don't have much of a sense of humour.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She grabbed his arms as he wrestled with the straps of the spinner.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't <em class="calibre9">need </em>it, understand?” she said. “It's just a dead weight! Trust me! <em class="calibre9">Don't </em>give in! You're making your own time. Don't wonder how.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stared at her in terror. “What's happening?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's okay, it's <em class="calibre9">okay</em>,” said Susan, as patiently as she could. “This sort of thing always comes as a shock. When it happened to me there wasn't anyone around, so consider yourself lucky.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What happened to you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I found out who my grandfather <em class="calibre9">was</em>. And don't ask. Now, concentrate. Where ought you to be?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Uh, uh…” Lobsang looked around. “Uh… over <em class="calibre9">that </em>way, I think.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wouldn't dream of asking you how you know,” said Susan. “And it's away from that mob.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She smiled. “Look on the bright side,” she added. “We're young, we've got all the time in the world…” She swung the wrench onto her shoulder. “Let's go clubbing.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">If there had been such a thing as time, it would have been a few minutes after Susan and Lobsang left that a small robed figure, about six inches high, strutted into the workshop. It was followed by a raven, which perched on the door and regarded the glowing clock with considerable suspicion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Looks dangerous to me,” it said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK? said the Death of Rats, advancing on the clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, don't you go trying to be a hero,” said Quoth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rat walked up to the base of the clock, stared up at it with a the-bigger-they-are-the-harder-they-fall expression, and then whacked it with its scythe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Or, at least, tried to. There was a flash as the blade made contact. For a moment the Death of Rats was a ring-shaped, black-and-white blur around the clock, and then it vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Told yer,” said the raven, preening its feathers. “I bet you feel like Mister Silly now, right?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“…and then I thought, what's a job that really needs someone with my talents?” said Ronnie. “To me, time is just another direction. And then I thought, everyone wants fresh milk, yes? And <em class="calibre9">everyone </em>wants it delivered early in the morning.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Got to be better than the window-cleaning,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I only went into that after they invented windows,” said Ronnie. “It was the jobbing gardening before that. More rancid yak butter in that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please,” said Lu-Tze, holding out his cup.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was eight hundred years old, and that was why he was having a rest. A hero would have leapt up and rushed out into the silent city and then—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And there you had it. Then a hero would have had to wonder what to do next. Eight hundred years had taught Lu-Tze that what happens stays happened. It might stay happened in a different set of dimensions, if you wanted to get technical, but you couldn't make it un-happen. The clock had struck, and time had stopped. Later, a solution would present itself. In the meantime, a cup of tea and conversation with his serendipitous rescuer might speed that time. After all, Ronnie was not your average milkman..</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze had long considered that everything happens for a reason, except possibly football.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's the real stuff you got there, Ronnie,” he said, taking a sip. “The butter we're getting these days, you wouldn't grease a cart with it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's the breed,” said Ronnie. “I go and get this from the highland herds six hundred years ago.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Cheers,” said Lu-Tze, raising his cup. “Funny, though. I mean, if you said to people there were originally <em class="calibre9">five </em>Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and then one of them left and became a milkman, well, they'd be a bit surprised. They'd wonder about why you…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For a moment Ronnie's eyes blazed silver.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Creative differences,” he growled. “The whole ego thing. Some people might say… no, I don't like to talk about it. I wish them all the luck in the world, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course,” said Lu-Tze, keeping his expression opaque.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I've watched their careers with great interest.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sure.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know I even got written out of the official history?” said Ronnie.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He held up a hand and a book appeared in it. It looked brand new.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This was <em class="calibre9">before</em>,” he said sourly. “Book of Om. Prophecies of Tobrun. Ever meet him? Tall man, beard, tendency to giggle at nothing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Before even my time, Ronnie.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie handed the book over.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“First edition. Try Chapter 2, verse 7,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And Lu-Tze read: “And the Angel clothed all in white opened the Iron Book, and a <em class="calibre9">fifth </em>rider appeared in a chariot of burning ice, and there was a snapping of laws and a breaking of bonds and the multitudes cried ‘Oh God, we're in trouble now!’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That was me,” said Ronnie proudly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's eyes strayed to verse 8: “And I saw, sort of like rabbits, in many colours but basically a plaid pattern, kind of spinning around, and there was a sound as of like big syrupy things.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That verse got cut for the next edition,” said Ronnie. “Very open to visions of all sorts, old Tobrun. The fathers of Omnianism could pick and mix what they wanted. Of course, in those days everything was new. Death was Death, <em class="calibre9">of course</em>, but the rest were really just Localized Crop Failure, Scuffles and Spots.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And you—?” Lu-Tze ventured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The public wasn't interested in me any more,” said Ronnie. “Or so I was told. Back in those days we were only playing to very small crowds. One plague of locusts, some tribe's waterhole drying up, a volcano exploding… We were glad of any gig going. There wasn't room for five.” He sniffed. “So I was told.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze put down his cup. “Well, Ronnie, it's been very nice talking to you, but time's… time's not rushing, you see.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah. Heard about that. The streets are full of the Law.” Ronnie's eyes blazed again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Law?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Dhlang</em>. The Auditors. They've had the glass clock built again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You <em class="calibre9">know </em>that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look, I might not be one of the Fearsome Four, but I do keep my eyes and ears open,” said Ronnie.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But that's the end of the world!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, it's not,” said Ronnie calmly. “Everything's still here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it's not going anywhere!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, well, that's not my problem, is it?” said Ronnie. “I do milk and dairy products.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze looked around the sparkling dairy, at the glistening bottles, at the gleaming churns. What a job for a timeless person. The milk would always be fresh.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked back at the bottles, and an unbidden thought rose in his mind.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Horsemen were people-shaped, and people are vain. Knowing how to use other people's vanity was a martial art all in itself, and Lu-Tze had been doing it for a long time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I bet I can work out who you were,” he said. “I bet I can work out your real name.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah. Not a chance, monk,” said Ronnie.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not a monk, just a sweeper,” said Lu-Tze calmly. “Just a sweeper. You called them the Law, Ronnie. There's got to be a law, right? They make the rules, Ronnie. And you've got to have rules, isn't that true?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I do milk and milk products,” said Ronnie, but a muscle twitched under his eye. “Also eggs by arrangement. It's a good steady business. I'm thinking of taking on more staff for the shop.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?” said Lu-Tze. “There won't be anything for them to do.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And expand the cheese side,” said Ronnie, not looking at the sweeper. “Big market for cheese. And I thought maybe I could get a c-mail address, people could send in orders, it could be a big market.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All the rules have won, Ronnie. Nothing moves any more. Nothing is unexpected because nothing happens.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie sat staring at nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can see you've found your niche, then, Ronnie,” said Lu-Tze soothingly. “And you keep this place like a new pin, there's no doubt about it. I expect the rest of the lads'd be really pleased to know that you're, you know, getting on all right. Just one thing, uh… Why did you rescue me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? Well, it was my charitable duty—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're the Fifth Horseman, Mr Soak. Charitable duty?” Except, Lu-Tze thought, you've been human-shaped a long time. You <em class="calibre9">want </em>me to find out… You <em class="calibre9">want </em>me to. Thousands of years of a life like this. It's curled you in on yourself. You'll fight me all the way, but you want me to drag your name out of you.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie's eyes glowed. “I look after my own, Sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm one of yours, am I?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You have… certain worthwhile points.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They stared at one another.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll take you back to where I found you,” said Ronnie Soak. “That's all. I don't do that other stuff any more.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditor lay on its back, mouth open. Occasionally it made a weak little noise, like the whimper of a gnat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Try again, Mr—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Dark Avocado, Mr White.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is that a real colour?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Mr White!” said Mr Dark Avocado, who wasn't entirely sure that it was.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Try again, then, Mr Dark Avocado.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr Dark Avocado, with great reluctance, reached down towards the supine figure's mouth. His fingers were a few inches away when, apparently of its own volition, the figure's left hand moved in a blur and gripped them. There was a crackle of bone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I feel extreme pain, Mr White.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is in its mouth, Mr Dark Avocado?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It appears to be cooked fermented grain product, Mr White. The extreme pain is continuing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A foodstuff?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Mr White. The sensations of pain are really quite noticeable at this point.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Did I not give an order that there should be no eating or drinking or unnecessary experimentation with sensory apparatus?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed you did, Mr White. The sensation known as extreme pain, which I mentioned previously, is now really quite acute. What shall I do now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The concept of “orders” was yet another new and intensely unfamiliar one for any Auditor. They were used to decisions by committee, reached only when the possibilities of doing nothing whatsoever about the matter in question had been exhausted. Decisions made by everyone were decisions made by no one, which therefore precluded any possibility of blame.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the <em class="calibre9">bodies </em>understood orders. This was clearly something that made humans human, and so the Auditors went along with it in a spirit of investigation. There was no choice, in any case. All kinds of sensations arose when they were given instructions by a man holding an edged weapon. It was surprising how smoothly the impulse to consult and discuss metamorphosed into a pressing desire to do what the weapon said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can you not persuade him to let go of your hand?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He appears to be unconscious, Mr White. His eyes are bloodshot. He is making a little sighing noise. Yet the body seems determined that the bread should not be removed. Could I raise again the issue of the unbearable pain?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White signalled to two other Auditors. With considerable effort, they pried Mr Dark Avocado's fingers loose.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is something we will have to learn more about,” said Mr White. “The renegade spoke of it. Mr Dark Avocado?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Mr White?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do the sensations of pain persist?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My hand feels both hot and cold, Mr White.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How strange,” said Mr White. “I see that we will need to investigate pain in greater depth.” Mr Dark Avocado found that a little voice in the back of his head screamed at the thought of this, while Mr White went on: “What other foodstuffs are there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We know the names of three thousand, seven hundred and nineteen foods,” said Mr Indigo-Violet, stepping forward. He had become the expert on such matters, and this was another new thing for the Auditors. They had never had experts before. What one knew, all knew. Knowing something that others did not know marked one as, in a small way, an individual. Individuals could die. But it also gave you power and value, which meant that you might <em class="calibre9">not </em>die quite so easily. It was a lot to deal with, and like some of the other Auditors he was already assembling a number of facial tics and twitches as his mind tried to cope.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Name one,” said Mr White.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Cheese,” said Mr Indigo-Violet smartly. “It is rotted bovine lactation.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We will find some cheese,” said Mr White.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Three Auditors went past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan peered out of a doorway. “Are you <em class="calibre9">sure </em>we're going the right way?” she said. “We're leaving the city centre.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is the way I should be going,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All right, but I don't like these narrow streets. I don't like <em class="calibre9">hiding</em>. I'm not a hiding kind of person.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I've noticed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's that place ahead?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's the back of the Royal Art Museum. Broad Way's on the other side,” said Lobsang. “And that's the way we need to go.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know your way around, for a man from the mountains.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I grew up here. I know five different ways to break into the museum, too. I used to be a thief.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I used to be able to walk through the walls,” said Susan. “Can't seem to do it with time stopped. I think the power gets cancelled out somehow.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You could really walk through a solid wall?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. It's a family tradition,” Susan snapped. “Come on, let's go through the museum. At least no one moves about much in there at the best of times.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ankh-Morpork had not had a king for many centuries, but palaces tend to survive. A city might not need a king, but it can always use big rooms and some handy large walls, long after the monarchy is but a memory and the building is renamed the Glorious Memorial to the People's Industry.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Besides, although the last king of the city was no oil painting himself—especially when he'd been beheaded, after which no one looks their best, not even a short king—it was generally agreed that he had amassed some pretty good works of art. Even the common people of the city had a keen eye for works like Caravati's <em class="calibre9">Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze </em>or Mauvaise's <em class="calibre9">Man with Big Figleaf </em>and, besides, a city with a history the length of Ankh-Morpork's accumulated all kinds of artistic debris, and in order to prevent congestion in the streets it needed some sort of civic attic in which to store it. And thus, at little more cost than a few miles of plush red rope and a few old men in uniform to give directions to <em class="calibre9">Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze</em>, the Royal Art Museum was born.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang and Susan hurried through the silent halls. As with Fidgett's, it was hard to know if time had stopped here. Its passage was barely perceptible in any case. The monks at Oi Dong considered it a valuable resource.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan stopped and turned to look up at a huge, gilt-framed picture that occupied one whole wall of a lengthy corridor, and said, quietly: “Oh…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">The Battle of Ar-Gash</em>, by Blitzt,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked at the flaking, uncleaned paint and the yellow-brown varnish. The colours had faded to a dozen shades of mud, but something violent and evil shone through.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is that meant to be Hell?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, it was an ancient city in Klatch, thousands of years ago,” said Susan. “But Grandfather did say that men made it Hell. Blitzt went mad when he painted it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, he did good storm clouds, though,” said Lobsang, swallowing. “Wonderful, er, light…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look at what's coming out of the clouds,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang squinted into the crusted cumulus and fossilized lightning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes. The Four Horsemen. You often get them in—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Count again,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stared. “There's two—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't be silly, there's fi—” she began, and then followed his gaze. He hadn't been interested in the art.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A couple of Auditors were hurrying away from them, towards the Porcelain Room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're running away from us!” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan grabbed his hand. “Not exactly,” she said. “They always consult! There have to be three of them to do that! And they'll be back, so come <em class="calibre9">on</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She grabbed his hand and towed him into the next gallery.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were grey figures at the far end. The pair ran on, past dust-encrusted tapestries, and into another huge, ancient room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ye gods, there's a picture of three huge pink women with only—” Lobsang began, as he was dragged past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Pay attention, will you? The way to the main door was back there! This place is <em class="calibre9">full </em>of Auditors!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it's just an old art gallery! There's nothing for them here, is there?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They slid to a stop on the marble slabs. A wide staircase led up to the next floor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll be trapped up there,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There're balconies all round,” said Susan. “Come on!” She dragged him up the stairs and through an archway. And stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The galleries were several storeys high. On the first floor, visitors could look down on to the floor below. And, in the room below, the Auditors were very busy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What the hell are they doing <em class="calibre9">now</em>?” whispered Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think,” said Susan grimly, “that they are appreciating Art.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Tangerine was annoyed. Her body kept making strange demands of her, and the work with which she had been entrusted was going so very badly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The frame of what once had been Sir Robert Cuspidors <em class="calibre9">Waggon Stuck In River </em>was leaning against a wall in front of her. It was empty. The bare canvas was neatly rolled beside it. In front of the frame, carefully heaped in order of size, were piles of pigment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Several dozen Auditors were breaking these down into their component molecules.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Still nothing?” she said, striding along the line.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, Miss Tangerine. Only known molecules and atoms so far,” said an Auditor, its voice shaking slightly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, is it something to do with the proportions? The balance of molecules? The basic geometry?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We are continuing to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Get on with it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other Auditors in the gallery, clustered industriously in front of what had once been a painting and in fact still was, insofar as every single molecule was still present in the room, glanced up and then bent again to their tasks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Tangerine was getting even angrier because she couldn't work out why she was angry. One reason was probably that, when he gave her this task, Mr White had <em class="calibre9">looked </em>at her in a funny way. Being looked at was an unfamiliar experience for an Auditor in any case—no Auditor bothered to look at another Auditor very often because all Auditors looked the same—and neither were they used to the idea that you could say things with your face. Or even have a face. Or have a body that reacted in strange ways to the expression on another face belonging to, in this case, Mr White. When he looked at her like that she felt a terrible urge to claw his face off.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Which made absolutely no sense at all. No Auditor should feel like that about another Auditor. No Auditor should feel like that about <em class="calibre9">anything</em>. No Auditor should <em class="calibre9">feel</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She <em class="calibre9">felt </em>livid. They'd all lost so many powers. It was ridiculous to have to communicate by flapping bits of your skin, and as for the tongue… <em class="calibre9">Yuerkkk</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As far as she knew, in the whole life of the universe, no Auditor had ever experienced the sensation of <em class="calibre9">yuerkkk</em>. This wretched body was full of opportunities for <em class="calibre9">yuerkkk</em>. She could leave it at any time and yet, and yet… part of her didn't want to. There was this horrible desire, second by second, to hang on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And she <em class="calibre9">felt </em>hungry. And that also made no sense. The stomach was a bag for digesting food. It wasn't supposed to issue <em class="calibre9">commands</em>. The Auditors could survive quite well by exchanging molecules with their surroundings and making use of any local source of energy. That was a fact.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Try telling that to the stomach. She could feel it. It was sitting there, grumbling. She was being <em class="calibre9">harassed </em>by her internal organs. Why the… why the.. why had they copied internal organs? <em class="calibre9">Yuerkkk</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was all too much. She wanted to… she wanted to… express herself by shouting some, some, some terrible words…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Discord! Confusion!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other Auditors looked around in terror.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the words didn't work for Miss Tangerine. They just didn't have the same force that they used to. There had to be something worse. Ah, yes…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Organs!” she shouted, pleased to have found it at last. “And what are all you… organs looking at?” she added. “Get on with it!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're taking everything apart,” whispered Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's the Auditors for you,” said Susan. “They think that's how you find out about things. You know, I <em class="calibre9">loathe </em>them. I really do.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang glanced sideways at her. The monastry was not a single-sex institution. That is to say, it <em class="calibre9">was</em>, but corporately it had never thought of itself like that because the possibility of females working there had never crossed even minds capable of thinking of sixteen dimensions. But the Thieves' Guild had recognized that girls were at least as good as boys in all areas of thieving—he had, for example, fond memories of his classmate Steff, who could steal the small change out of your back pocket and climb better than an Assassin. He was at home around girls. But Susan scared the life out of him. It was as if some secret place inside her boiled with wrath, and with the Auditors she let it out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He remembered her hitting that one with the wrench. There had been just a faint frown of concentration, as if she was making certain the job was done properly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Shall we go?” he ventured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look at them,” continued Susan. “Only an Auditor would take a picture apart to see what made it a work of art.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's a big pile of white dust over there,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Man with Huge Figleaf</em>” said Susan absently, her eyes still intent on the grey figures. “They'd dismantle a clock to search for the tick.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How do you know its <em class="calibre9">Man with Huge Figleaf</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just happen to remember where it is, that's all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You, er, you appreciate art?” Lobsang ventured.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I know what I like,” said Susan, still staring at the busy grey figures. “And right now I'd like quite a lot of weaponry.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'd better move—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The <em class="calibre9">bastards </em>get into your head if you let them,” said Susan, not moving. “When you find yourself thinking ‘There ought to be a law’ or ‘I don't make the rules, after all’ or—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I really think we should leave,” said Lobsang carefully. “And I think this because there are some of them coming up the stairs.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Her head jerked around. “What are you standing about for, then?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They ran through the next arch and into a gallery of pottery, turning to look only when they reached the far end. Three Auditors were following them. They weren't running, but there was something about their synchronized step that had a horrible we'll-keep-on-coming quality.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All right, let's go this way—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, let's go <em class="calibre9">this </em>way,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's not the way we need to go!” Susan snapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, but the sign up there says ‘Arms and Armour’!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So? Are you any good with weapons?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">No!</em>” said Lobsang proudly, and then realized she'd taken this the wrong way. “You see, I've been taught to fight without—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Maybe there's a sword I can use,” Susan growled, and strode forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">By the time the Auditors entered the gallery there were more than three of them. The grey crowd paused.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan had found a sword, part of a display of Agatean armour. It had been blunted by disuse, but anger flared along the blade.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Should we keep running?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. They always catch up. I don't know if we can kill them here, but we can make them wish we could. You still haven't got a weapon?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, because, you see, I've been trained to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just keep out of my way, then, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors advanced cautiously, which struck Lobsang as odd.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We can't kill them?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It depends on how alive they've let themselves become.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But they <em class="calibre9">look </em>scared,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're human-shaped,” said Susan over her shoulder. “Human bodies. Perfect copies. Human bodies have had thousands and thousands of years of not wanting to be cut in half. That sort of leaks into the brain, don't you think?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then the Auditors were circling and moving in. Of course they would all attack at once. No one would want to be first.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Three made a grab at Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd enjoyed the fighting, back in the training dojos. Of course, everyone was padded, and no one was actually trying to kill you, and that helped. But Lobsang had done well because he was good at slicing. He could always find that extra edge. And if you had that edge, you didn't need quite so much skill.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no edge here. There was no time to slice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He adopted a mixture of <em class="calibre9">sna-fu </em>and <em class="calibre9">okidoki </em>and anything that worked, because you were dead if you treated a real fight like the dojo. The grey men were no contest, in any case. They just attempted to grab and hug. A granny would have been able to fend them off.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He sent two reeling and turned to the third, which was trying to grab him around the neck. He broke the hold, spun around ready to chop, and hesitated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, good grief!” said a voice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan's blade whirled past Lobsang's face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The head in front of him was parted from its former body in a shower not of blood but of coloured, floating dust. The body evaporated, became very briefly a grey-robed shape in the air, and vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang heard a couple of thumps behind him, and then Susan grabbed his shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're not supposed to <em class="calibre9">hesitate</em>, you know!” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But it was a woman!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was <em class="calibre9">not</em>! But it <em class="calibre9">was </em>the last one. Now let's go, before the rest get here.” She nodded at a second group of Auditors that were watching them very carefully from the end of the hall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They weren't much of a contest anyway,” said Lobsang, getting his breath. “What are <em class="calibre9">those </em>doing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Learning. Can you fight better than that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good, because next time they'll be as good as you just were. Where to now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, this way!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The next gallery was full of stuffed animals. There'd been a vogue for it a few centuries before. These weren't the sad old hunting-trophy bears or geriatric tigers whose claws had faced a man armed with nothing more than five crossbows, twenty loaders and a hundred beaters. Some of <em class="calibre9">these </em>animals were arranged in groups. Quite small groups, of quite small animals.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were frogs, seated around a tiny dining table. There were dogs, dressed in hunting jackets, in pursuit of a fox wearing a cap with feathers in it. There was a monkey playing a banjo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, no, it's an entire band,” said Susan in tones of horrified astonishment. “And just <em class="calibre9">look </em>at the little kittens dancing…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Horrible!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wonder what happened when the man who did this met my grandfather.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Would he have met your grandfather?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said Susan. “Oh, yes. And my grandfather is rather fond of cats.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang paused at the foot of a staircase, half hidden behind a luckless elephant. A red rope, now hard as a bar, suggested that this wasn't part of the public museum. There was an added hint in the shape of a notice saying: “Absolutely No Admittance”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I should be up there,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Let's not hang around, then, eh?” said Susan, leaping over the rope.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The narrow stairs led up onto a large, bare landing. Boxes were stacked here and there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The attics,” said Susan. “Hold on… What's that sign for?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“‘Keep left’,” Lobsang read. “Well, if they have to move heavy items around—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Look </em>at the sign, will you?” said Susan. “Don't see what you expect to see, see what's in front of you!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <img src="sign.png" class="calibre13"/>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What a stupid sign,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hmm. Interesting, certainly,” said Susan. “Which way do <em class="calibre9">you</em> think we should go? I don't think it'll take them too long to decide to follow us.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're so close! Any passage might do!” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Any passage it is, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan headed for a narrow gap between packing cases. Lobsang followed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do you mean, decide?” he said, as they entered the gloom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The sign on the stairs said there was no admittance.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean they'll disobey it?” He stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Eventually. But they'll have a terrible feeling that they ought not to. They obey rules. They <em class="calibre9">are </em>the rules, in a way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you <em class="calibre9">can't </em>obey the Keep Left/Right sign, no matter what you do… oh, I see…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Isn't learning fun? Oh, and here's another one.” </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <strong class="calibre12">DO NOT FEED THE ELEPHANT</strong>.</div>
      </blockquote>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now that,” said Susan, “is good. You can't obey it…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…because there's no elephant,” said Lobsang. “I think I'm getting the hang of this…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's an Auditor trap,” said Susan, peering at a packing case.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Here's another good one,” said Lobsang. </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">

      </blockquote>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nice touch,” Susan agreed, “but I'm wondering… who put up the signs?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were voices, someone behind them. They were low, but then one was suddenly raised.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“ <em class="calibre9">–says Left but points Right! It has no sense!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">The fault is yours! We disobeyed the first sign! Woe to them that stray onto the pathway of irregularity!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Don't you give me that, you organic thing! I raise my voice at you, you—</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a soft sound, a choking noise, and a scream that dopplered into nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are they <em class="calibre9">fighting </em>one another?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We can only hope so. Let's move,” said Susan. They crept on, weaving through the maze of spaces between the crates, and past a sign saying:</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <blockquote class="calibre11">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <strong class="calibre12">DUCK</strong>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah… now we're getting metaphysical,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why duck?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why indeed?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Somewhere amongst the cases a voice reached the end of its tether.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">What organic damn elephant? Where is the elephant?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">There is no elephant!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">How can there be a sign, then?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">It is a—</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…And once again the little choke, and the vanishing scream. And then… running footsteps.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan and Lobsang backed into the shadows, and then Susan said, “What <em class="calibre9">have </em>I put my foot in?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She reached down and picked up the soft, sticky mess. And as she rose, she saw the Auditor come round the corner.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was wild-eyed and frantic. It focused on the pair of them with difficulty, as if trying to remember who and what they were. But it was holding a sword, and holding it correctly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A figure rose up behind it. One hand grabbed it by the hair and jerked its head back. The other was thrust over its open mouth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditor struggled for a moment, and then went rigid.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then disintegrated, tiny particles spinning away and disappearing into nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For a moment the last few handfuls tried to form, in the air, the shape of a small cowled figure. Then it, too, was dragged apart, with a faint scream that was heard via the hairs on the back of the neck.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan glared at the figure in front of her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're a… you can't be a… what <em class="calibre9">are </em>you?” she demanded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The figure was silent. This might have been because thick cloth covered its nose and mouth. Heavy gloves encased its hands, too. And this was odd, because most of the rest of it was wearing a sequinned evening gown. And a mink stole. And a knapsack. And a huge picture hat with enough feathers to make three rare species totally extinct.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The figure rummaged in the knapsack, and then thrust out a piece of dark brown paper, as if proffering holy writ. Lobsang took it with care.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It says here ‘Higgs &amp; Meakins Luxury Assortment’,” he said. “Caramel Crunch, Hazelnut Surprise… They're chocolates?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan opened her hand and looked at the crushed Strawberry Whirl she had picked up. She gave the figure a careful look. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did you know that would work?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please! You have nothing to fear from me,” said the muffled voice through the bandages. “I'm down to the ones with the nuts in now, and they don't melt very quickly.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry?” said Lobsang. “You just killed an Auditor with a <em class="calibre9">chocolate</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My last Orange Creme, yes. We are exposed here. Come with me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“An Auditor…” Susan breathed. “You're an Auditor too. Aren't you? Why should I trust you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There isn't anyone else.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you are one of <em class="calibre9">them</em>,” said Susan. “I can tell, even under all that.. that stuff!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">was </em>one of them,” said Lady LeJean. “Now I rather think I'm one of me.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">People were living in the attic. There was a whole family up there. Susan wondered if their presence was official or unofficial or one of those in-between states that were so common in Ankh-Morpork, where there was always a chronic housing shortage. So much of the city's life took place on the street because there was no room for it inside. Whole families were raised in shifts, so that the bed could be used for twenty-four hours a day. By the look of it, the caretakers and men who knew the way to Caravati's <em class="calibre9">Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze </em>had moved their families in to the rambling attics.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rescuer had simply moved in on top of them. A family, or at least one shift of it, was seated on benches around a table. frozen in timelessness. Lady LeJean removed her hat, hung it on the mother and shook out her hair. Then she unwrapped the heavy bandages from her nose and mouth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We are relatively safe here,” she said. “They are mostly in the main streets. Good… day. My name is Myria LeJean. I know who you are, Susan Sto Helit. I do not know the young man, which surprises me. I take it you are here to destroy the clock?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“To stop it,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hold on, hold <em class="calibre9">on</em>,” said Susan. “This makes no sense. Auditors hate everything about life. And you <em class="calibre9">are </em>an Auditor, aren't you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I have no idea what I am,” sighed Lady LeJean. “But right now I know that I am everything an Auditor should not be. We… they… we have to be stopped!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“With chocolate?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The sense of taste is new to us. Alien. We have no defences.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… chocolate?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“A dry biscuit almost killed me,” said her ladyship. “Susan, can you imagine what it is like to experience taste for the first time? We built our bodies well. Oh, yes. Lots of tastebuds. Water is like wine. But chocolate… even the mind stops. There is nothing but the taste.” She sighed. “I imagine it is a wonderful way to die.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It doesn't seem to affect you,” said Susan suspiciously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The bandages and the gloves,” said Lady LeJean. “Even then, it is all I can do not to give in. Oh, where are my manners? Do sit down. Pull up a small child.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang and Susan exchanged a glance. Lady LeJean noticed it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I said something wrong?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We don't use people as furniture,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But surely they will not be aware of it?” said her ladyship.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">We </em>will,” said Lobsang. “That's the point, really.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah. I have so much to learn. There is… there is so much <em class="calibre9">context </em>to being human, I am afraid. You, sir, can you stop the clock?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know how to,” said Lobsang. “But I… I think I <em class="calibre9">should </em>know. I'll try.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Would the clockmaker know? He is here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Where</em>?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just down the passage,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You carried him here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He was barely able to walk. He was hurt badly in the fight.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?” said Lobsang. “How could he walk at all? We're outside time!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan took a deep breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He carries his own time, just like you,” she said. “He's your brother.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And it was a lie. But he wasn't ready for the truth. By the look on his face, he wasn't even ready for the lie.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Twins,” said Mrs Ogg. She picked up the brandy glass, looked at it, and put it down. “There wasn't one. There was twins. Two boys. But</em>…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">She turned on Susan a glare like a thermic lance. “You'll be thinking, this is an old biddy of a midwife,” she said. “You'll be thinking, what does she know</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Susan paid her the courtesy of not lying</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Part of me was,” she admitted.</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Good answer! <strong class="calibre12">Part</strong> of us thinks all kinds of things,” said Mrs Ogg. “Part of me is thinking, who's this haughty little miss who talks to me as if I was a kiddie of five? But most of me is thinking: she's got a heap of troubles of her own and has seen plenty of things a human shouldn't have to see. Mind you, part of me says: so have I. Seeing things a human shouldn't have to see makes us human. Well, miss… if you've any sense, <strong class="calibre12">part</strong> of you is thinking, there's a witch in front of me who's seen my granddad many times, when she's sat by a sickbed that's suddenly become a deathbed, and if she's ready to spit in his eye when the time comes then she could probably bother me considerably right now if she puts her mind to it. Understand? Let's all keep our parts to ourselves,” and suddenly she gave Susan a wink, “as the High Priest said to the actress.</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">I absolutely agree,” said Susan. “Completely</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Right,” said Mrs Ogg. “So… twins… well, it was her first time, and human wasn't exactly a familiar shape with her, I mean, you can't do what comes naturally when you ain't exactly natural and… twins ain't quite the right word</em>…”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“A brother,” said Lobsang. “The clockmaker?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I was a foundling!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So was he.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I want to see him now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That might not be a good idea,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am not interested in your opinion, thank you.” Lobsang turned to Lady LeJean. “Down that passage?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. But he's asleep. I think the clock upset his mind, and also he was hit in the fight. He says things in his sleep.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Says what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The last thing I heard him say before I came to find you was, ‘We're so close. Any passage might do,’” said her ladyship. She looked from one to the other. “Have I said the wrong thing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan put her hand over her eyes. Oh dear…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">I</em> said that,” said Lobsang. “Just after we came up the stairs.” He glared at Susan. “Twins, right? I've heard about this sort of thing! What one thinks the other thinks too?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed. Sometimes, she thought, I really am a coward. “Something like that, yes,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm going to see him, then, even if he can't see me!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Damn, thought Susan, and hurried after Lobsang as he headed along the passage. The Auditor trailed behind them, looking concerned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Jeremy was lying on a bed, although it was no softer than anything else in the timeless world. Lobsang stopped, and stared.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He looks… quite like me,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thinner, perhaps.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Could be, yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Different… lines on his face.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've led different lives,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“How did you know about him and me?” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My grandfather takes, er, an interest in this sort of thing. I found out some more by myself, too,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why should we interest anyone? We're not special.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is going to be quite hard to explain.” Susan looked round at Lady LeJean. “How safe are we here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The signs upset them,” said her ladyship. “They tend to keep away. I… shall we say… took care of the ones who followed you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then you'd better sit down, Mr Lobsang,” said Susan. “It might help if I told you about me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My grandfather is Death.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's a strange thing to say. Death is just the end of life. It's not a… a person—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“PAY ATTENTION TO ME WHEN I AM TALKING TO YOU…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A wind whipped around the room, and the light changed. Shadows formed on Susan's face. A faint blue light outlined her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang swallowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The light faded. The shadows vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There is a process called death, and there is a person called Death,” said Susan. “That is how it works. And I am Death's granddaughter. Am I going too fast for you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, no, although right up until just now you looked human,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My parents were human. There's more than one kind of genetics.” Susan paused. “You look human, too. Human is a very popular look in these parts. You'd be amazed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Except that I <em class="calibre9">am </em>human.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan gave a little smile that, on anyone less obviously in full control of themself, might have seemed slightly nervous.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” she said. “And, then again, no.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Take War, now,” said Susan, backing away from the point. “Big man, hearty laugh, tends to fart after meals. As human as the next man, you say. But the next man is Death. He's human-shaped, too. And that's because humans invented the idea of… of… of <em class="calibre9">ideas</em>, and they think in human shapes—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Get back to the ‘and, then again, no’, will you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Your mother is Time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No one knows who my mother is!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I could take you to the midwife,” said Susan. “Your father found the best there's ever been. She delivered you. Your mother was Time.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang sat with his mouth open.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was easier for me,” said Susan. “When I was very small my parents used to let me visit my grandfather. I thought every grandfather had a long black robe and rode a pale horse. And then they decided that maybe that wasn't the right environment for a child. They were worried about how I was going to grow up!” She laughed mirthlessly. “I had a very strange education, you know? Maths, logic, that sort of thing. And then, when I was a bit younger than you, a rat turned up in my room and suddenly everything I thought I knew was wrong.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm a human! I do human things! I'd <em class="calibre9">know </em>if—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You had to live in the world. Otherwise, how could you learn to be human?” said Susan, as kindly as she could.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And my brother? What about <em class="calibre9">him</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Here it comes, Susan thought. “He's not your brother,” she said. “I lied a bit. I'm sorry.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you said—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I had to lead up to it,” said Susan. “It's one of those things you have to get hold of a bit at a time, I'm afraid. He's not your brother. He's you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then who am I?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed. “You. Both of you… are you.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">And there I was, and there she was</em>,” <em class="calibre9">said Mrs Ogg, “and out the baby came, no problem there, but that's always a tryin' moment for the new mum, and there was…” she paused, her eyes peering through the windows of memory, “like… like a feelin' that the world had stuttered, and I was holdin' the baby and I looked down and there was me deliverin' a baby, and I looked at <strong class="calibre12">me</strong>, and <strong class="calibre12">I</strong> looked at me, and I remember saying, ‘This is a fine to-do, Mrs Ogg,’ and she, who was me, said, ‘You never said a truer word, Mrs Ogg,’ and then it all went strange and there I was, just one of me, holdin' two babies”</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Twins</em>,” <em class="calibre9">Susan said</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">You could call them twins, yes, I s'pose you could,” said Mrs Ogg. “But I always thought that twins is two little souls born once, not one born twice</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Susan waited. Mrs Ogg looked in the mood to talk.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">So I said to the man, I said, ‘What now?’ and he said, ‘Is that any business of yours?’ and I said he could be damn sure it was my business and he could look me in the eye and I'd speak my mind to anyone. But I was thinking, you're in trouble now, my girl, 'cos it'd all gone myffic</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Mythic?” said schoolteacher Susan</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Yep. With extra myff. And you can get into big trouble, with myffic. But the man just smiled and said that he must be brought up human until he's of age and I thought, yep, it's gone myffic all right. I could see he hadn't got a clue about what to do next and it was all going to be down to me</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Mrs Ogg took a suck at her pipe and her eyes twinkled at Susan through the smoke. “I don't know how much experience you have with this sort of thing, my girl, but sometimes when the high and mighty make big plans they don't always think about the fine detail, right?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Yes. <strong class="calibre12">I'm</strong> a fine detail, Susan thought. One day Death took it into his skull to adopt a motherless child, and I'm a fine detail. She nodded</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">I thought, how does this go, in a myffic kind of way?” Mrs Ogg went on. “I mean, technic'ly I could see we're in that area where the prince gets brought up as a swineherd until he manifests his destiny, but there's not that many swineherding jobs around these days, and poking hogs with a stick is not all it's cracked up to be, believe you me. So I said, well, I'd heard the Guilds down in the big cities took in foundlings out of charity, and looked after them well enough, and there's many well set-up men and women who started life that way. There's no shame in it, plus, if the destiny doesn't manifest as per schedule, he'd have set his hands to a good trade, which would be a consolation. Whereas swineherding 's just swineherding. You're giving me a stern look, miss</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Well, yes. It was rather a chilly decision, wasn't it?</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Someone has to make 'em,” said Mrs Ogg sharply. “Besides, I've been around for some time and I've noticed that them as has it in them to shine will shine through six layers of muck, whereas those who ain't shiny won't shine however much you buff 'em. You may think otherwise, but it was me standing there</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">She investigated the bowl of her pipe with a matchstick</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Eventually she went on: “And that was it. I would have stayed, of course, because there wasn't so much as a crib in the place, but the man took me aside and said thank you and that it was time to go. And why would I argue? There was love there. It was in the air. But I won't say that I don't sometimes wonder how it all turned out. I really do</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There were differences, Susan had to admit. Two different lives had indeed burned their unique tracks on the faces. And the selves had been born a second or so apart, and a lot of the universe can change in a second.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Think of identical twins, she told herself. But they are two different selves occupying bodies that, at least, start out identical. They don't start out as identical <em class="calibre9">selves</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He looks <em class="calibre9">quite </em>like me,” said Lobsang, and Susan blinked. She leaned closer to the unconscious form of Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Say that again,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I said, he looks quite like me,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan glanced at Lady LeJean, who said, “I saw it too, Susan.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who saw what?” said Lobsang. “What are you hiding from me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“His lips move when you speak,” said Susan. “They try to form the same words.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He can pick up my thoughts?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's more complicated than that, I think.” Susan picked up a limp hand and gently pinched the web of skin between thumb and forefinger.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang winced, and glanced at his own hand. A patch of white skin was reddening again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not just thoughts,” said Susan. “This close, you feel his pain. Your speech controls his lips.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stared down at Jeremy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then what will happen,” he said slowly, “when he comes round?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm wondering the same thing,” said Susan. “Perhaps you shouldn't be here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But this is where I have to be!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We at least should not stay here,” said Lady LeJean. “I know my kind. They will have been discussing what to do. The signs will not hold them for ever. And I have run out of soft centres.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you supposed to <em class="calibre9">do </em>when you are where you're supposed to <em class="calibre9">be</em>?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang reached down and touched Jeremy's hand with his fingertip.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The world went white.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan wondered later if this was what it would be like at the heart of a star. It wouldn't be yellow, you wouldn't see fire, there would just be the searing whiteness of every overloaded sense screaming all at once.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It faded, gradually, into a mist. The walls of the room appeared, but she could see through them. There were other walls beyond, and other rooms, transparent as ice and visible only at the corners and where the light caught them. In each one another Susan was turning to look at her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The rooms went on for ever.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan was sensible. It was, she knew, a major character flaw. It did not make you popular, or cheerful, and—this seemed to her to be the most unfair bit—it didn't even make you <em class="calibre9">right</em>. But it did make you definite, and she was definite that what was happening around her was not, in any accepted sense, real.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">That was not in itself a problem. Most of the things humans busied themselves with weren't real, either. But sometimes the mind of the most sensible person encountered something so big, so complex, so alien to all understanding, that it told itself little stories about it instead. Then, when it felt it understood the story, it felt it understood the huge incomprehensible thing. And this, Susan knew, was her mind telling itself a story.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a sound like great heavy metal doors slamming, one after another, getting louder and faster…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The universe reached a decision.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other glass rooms vanished. The walls clouded. Colour rose, pastel at first, then darkening as timeless reality flowed back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The bed was empty. Lobsang had gone. But the air was full of slivers of blue light, turning and swirling like ribbons in a storm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan remembered to breathe again. “Oh,” she said aloud. “Destiny.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She turned. The bedraggled Lady LeJean was still staring at the empty bed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is there another way out of here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's an elevator at the end of the corridor, Susan, but what happened to—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not Susan,” said Susan sharply. “It's <em class="calibre9">Miss </em>Susan. I'm only Susan to my friends, and you are not one of them. I don't trust you at all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't trust me either,” said Lady LeJean meekly. “Does that help?” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Show me this elevator, will you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It turned out to be nothing more than a large box the size of a small room, which hung from a web of ropes and pulleys in the ceiling. It had been installed recently, by the look of it, to move the large works of art around. Sliding doors occupied most of one wall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There are capstans in the cellar for winching it up,” said Lady LeJean. “Downward journeys are slowed safely because of a mechanism by which the weight of the descending elevator causes water to be pumped up into rainwater cisterns on the roof, which in turn can be released back into a hollow counterweight that assists in the elevation of heavier items of—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you,” said Susan quickly. “But what it really needs in order to descend is <em class="calibre9">time</em>.” Under her breath she added, “Can you help?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The ribbons of blue light orbited her, like puppies anxious to play, and then drifted towards the elevator.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“However,” she added, “I believe Time is on our side now.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Miss Tangerine was amazed at how fast a body learned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Until now Auditors had learned by counting. Sooner or later, everything came down to numbers. If you knew all the numbers, you knew everything. Often the later was a <em class="calibre9">lot </em>later, but that did not matter because for an Auditor time was just another number. But a brain, a few soggy pounds of gristle, counted numbers so fast that they stopped being numbers at all. She'd been astonished at how easily it could direct a hand to catch a ball in the air, calculating future positions of hand and ball without her even being aware of it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The senses seemed to operate and present her with conclusions before <em class="calibre9">she </em>had time to think.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the moment she was trying to explain to other Auditors that not feeding an elephant when there was no elephant not to feed was not in fact impossible. Miss Tangerine was one of the faster-learning Auditors and had already formulated a group of things, events and situations that she categorized as “bloody stupid”. Things that were “bloody stupid” could be dismissed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some of the others were having difficulty understanding this, but now she stopped in mid-harangue when she heard the rumble of the elevator.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do we have anyone upstairs?” she demanded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors around her shook their heads. “IGNORE THIS NOTICE” had produced too much confusion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then someone is coming down!” said Miss Tangerine. “They are out of place! They must be stopped!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We must discuss—” an Auditor began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do what I say, you organic organ!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a matter of personalities,” said Lady LeJean, as Susan pushed open a door in the roof and stepped out onto the leads.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes?” said Susan, looking around at the silent city. “I thought you didn't have them.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They will have them now,” said Lady LeJean, climbing out behind her. “And personalities define themselves in terms of other personalities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan, prowling along the parapet, considered this strange sentence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean there will be flaming rows?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. We have never had egos before.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, <em class="calibre9">you </em>seem to be managing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only by becoming completely and utterly insane,” said her ladyship.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan turned. Lady LeJean's hat and dress had become even more tattered, and she was shedding sequins. And then there was the matter of the face. An exquisite mask on a bone structure like fine china had been made up by a clown. Probably a blind clown. And one who was wearing boxing gloves. In a fog. Lady LeJean looked at the world through panda eyes and her lipstick touched her mouth only by accident.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't <em class="calibre9">look </em>insane,” lied Susan. “As such.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you. But sanity is defined by the majority, I am afraid. Do you know the saying ‘The whole is greater than the sum of the parts’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course.” Susan scanned the rooftops for a way down. She did not need this. The… thing seemed to want to talk. Or, rather, to chatter aimlessly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is an insane statement. It is a nonsense. But now I believe that it is true.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. That elevator should be getting down about… now.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Slivers of blue light, like trout slipping through a stream, danced around the elevator door.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors gathered. They had been learning. Many of them had acquired weapons. And a number of them had taken care not to communicate to the others that gripping something offensive in the hand seemed a very <em class="calibre9">natural </em>thing to do. It spoke to something right down in the back of the brain.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was therefore unfortunate that when a couple of them pulled open the elevator door it was to reveal, slightly melting in the middle of the floor, a cherry liqueur chocolate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The scent <em class="calibre9">wafted</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was only one survivor and, when Miss Tangerine ate the chocolate, there wasn't even that.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“One of life's little certainties,” said Susan, standing on the edge of the museum's parapet, “is that there is generally a last chocolate hidden in all those empty wrappers.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she reached down and grabbed the top of a drainpipe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She wasn't certain how this would work. If she fell… but would she fall? There was no <em class="calibre9">time </em>to fall. She had her own personal time. In theory, if anything so definite as a theory existed in a case like this, that meant she could just drift down to the ground. But the time to test a theory like that was when you had no other choice. A theory was just an idea, but a drainpipe was a fact.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The blue light flickered around her hands.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lobsang?” she said quietly. “It <em class="calibre9">is </em>you, isn't it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">That name is as good as any for us</em>. The voice was as faint as a breath.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This may seem a stupid question, but where are you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">We are just a memory. And I am weak</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh.” Susan slid a little further.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">But I will grow strong. Get to the clock</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's the point? There was nothing we could do!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Times have changed</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan reached the ground. Lady LeJean followed, moving clumsily. Her evening dress had acquired several more tears.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can I offer a fashion tip?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It would be welcomed,” said her ladyship politely.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Long cerise bloomers with that dress? Not a good idea.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No? They are very colourful, and quite warm. What should I have chosen instead?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“With that cut? Practically nothing.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That would have been acceptable?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er…” Susan blanched at unfolding the complex laws of lingerie to someone who wasn't even, she felt, anybody. “To anyone likely to find out, yes,” she finished. “It would take too long to explain.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean sighed. “All of it does,” she said. “Even clothing. Skin-substitutes to preserve body heat? So simple. So easy to say. But there are so many rules and exceptions, impossible to understand.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked along Broad Way. It was thick with silent traffic, but there was no sign of an Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll run into more of them,” she said aloud.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. There will be hundreds, at least,” said Lady LeJean.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Because we have always wondered what life is like.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then let's get up into Zephire Street,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is there for us?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Wienrich and Boettcher.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who are they?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think the original Herr Wienrich and Frau Boettcher died a long time ago. But the shop still does very good business,” said Susan, darting across the street. “We need ammunition.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean caught up. “Oh. They make chocolate?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Does a bear poo in the woods?” said Susan, and realized her mistake straight away.<a href="#TOT_APF16" title="16. Teaching small children for any length of time can do this to a vocabulary."><sup class="calibre10">16</sup></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Too late. Lady LeJean looked thoughtful for a moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” she said at last. “Yes, I believe that most varieties do indeed excrete as you suggest, at least in the temperate zones, but there are several that—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I meant to say that, yes, they make chocolate,” said Susan.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Vanity, vanity, thought Lu-Tze, as the milk cart rattled through the silent city. Ronnie would have been like a god, and people of that stripe don't like hiding. Not <em class="calibre9">really </em>hiding. They like to leave a little clue, some emerald tablet somewhere, some code in some tomb under the desert, something to say to the keen researcher: I was here, and I was great.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">What else had the first people been afraid of? Night, maybe. Cold. Bears. Winter. Stars. The endless sky. Spiders. Snakes. One another. People had been afraid of so many things.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached into his pack for the battered copy of the Way, and opened it at random.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Koan </em>97: “Do unto otters as you would have them do unto you.” Hmm. No real help there. Besides, he'd occasionally been unsure that he'd written that one down properly, although it certainly had worked. He'd always left aquatic mammals well alone, and they had done the same to him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He tried again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Koan </em>124: “It's amazing what you see if you keep your eyes open.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's the book, monk?” said Ronnie.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, just… a little book,” said Lu-Tze. He looked around.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The cart was passing a funeral parlour. The owner had invested in a large plate-glass window, even though the professional undertaker does not, in truth, have that much to sell that looks good in a window and they usually make do with dark, sombre drapes and perhaps a tasteful urn.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And the name of the Fifth Horseman.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah!” said Lu-Tze quietly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Something funny, monk?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Obvious, when you think about it,” said Lu-Tze, as much to himself as to Ronnie. Then he turned in his seat and stuck out his hand. “Pleased to meet you,” he said. “Let me guess your name.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And said it.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan had been unusually inexact. To call Wienrich and Boettcher “chocolate makers” was like calling Leonard of Quirm “a decent painter who also tinkered with things”, or Death “not someone you'd want to meet every day”. It was accurate, but it didn't tell the whole story.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">For one thing, they didn't make, they <em class="calibre9">created</em>. There's an important difference.<a href="#TOT_APF17" title="17. Up to ten dollars a pound, usually."><sup class="calibre10">17</sup></a> And, while their select little shop sold the results, it didn't do anything so crass as to fill the window with them. That would suggest… well, over-eagerness. Generally, W&amp;B had a display of silk and velvet drapes with, on a small stand, perhaps one of their special pralines or no more than three of their renowned frosted caramels. There was no price tag. If you had to ask the price of W&amp;B's chocolates, you couldn't afford them. And if you'd tasted one, and still couldn't afford them, you'd save and scrimp and rob and sell elderly members of your family for just one more of those mouthfuls that fell in love with your tongue and turned your soul to whipped cream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a discreet drain in the pavement in case people standing in front of the window drooled too much.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wienrich and Boettcher were, naturally, foreigners, and according to Ankh-Morpork's Guild of Confectioners they did not understand the peculiarities of the city's tastebuds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ankh-Morpork people, said the Guild, were hearty, no-nonsense folk who did not <em class="calibre9">want </em>chocolate that was stuffed with cocoa liquor, and were certainly not like effete la-di-dah foreigners who wanted cream in everything. In fact they actually <em class="calibre9">preferred </em>chocolate made mostly from milk, sugar, suet, hooves, lips, miscellaneous squeezings, rat droppings, plaster, flies, tallow, bits of tree, hair, lint, spiders and powdered cocoa husks. This meant that according to the food standards of the great chocolate centres in Borogravia and Quirm, Ankh-Morpork chocolate was formally classed as “cheese” and only escaped, through being the wrong colour, being defined as “tile grout”.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan allowed herself one of their cheaper boxes per month. And she could easily stop at the first layer if she wanted to.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You needn't come in,” she said, as she opened the shop door. Rigid customers lined the counter.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please call me Myria.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think I—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Please?” said Lady LeJean meekly. “A name is important.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Suddenly, in spite of everything, Susan felt a brief pang of sympathy for the creature.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, very <em class="calibre9">well</em>. Myria, you needn't come in.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can stand it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I thought chocolate was a raging temptation?” said Susan, being firm with herself.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They stared up at the shelves behind the counter.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Myria… Myria,” said Susan, speaking only some of her thoughts aloud. “From the Ephebian word <em class="calibre9">myrios</em>, meaning ‘innumerable’. And LeJean as a crude pun of ‘legion’… Oh dear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We thought a name should say what a thing is,” said her ladyship. “And there is safety in numbers. I am sorry.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, these are their basic assortments,” said Susan, dismissing the shop display with a wave of her hand. “Let's try the back room—Are you all right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am fine, I am fine…” murmured Lady LeJean, swaying.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're not going to pig out on me, are you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We… I… know about will-power. The body craves the chocolate but the mind does not. At least, so I tell myself. And it must be true! The mind can overrule the body! Otherwise, what is it for?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've often wondered,” said Susan, pushing open another door. “Ah. The magician's cave…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Magic? They use magic here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nearly right.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lady LeJean leaned on the door frame for support when she saw the tables.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh,” she said. “Uh… I can detect… sugar, milk, butter, cream, vanilla, hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, raisins, orange peel, various liqueurs, citrus pectin, strawberries, raspberries, essence of violets, cherries, pineapples, pistachios, oranges, limes, lemons, coffee, cocoa—” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nothing there to be frightened of, right?” said Susan, surveying the workshop for useful weaponry. “Cocoa is just a rather bitter bean, after all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but…” Lady LeJean clenched her fists, shut her eyes and bared her teeth, “put them all together and they make—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Steady, steady…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The will can overrule the emotions, the will can overrule the instincts—” the Auditor chanted.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good, good, now just work your way up to the bit where it says chocolate, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">That's the hard one</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In fact, it seemed to Susan, as she walked past the vats and counters, that chocolate lost some of its attraction when you saw it like this. It was the difference between seeing the little heaps of pigment and seeing the whole picture. She selected a syringe that seemed designed to do something intensely personal to female elephants, athough she decided that here it was probably used for doing the wiggly bits of decoration.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And over <em class="calibre9">here </em>was a small vat of cocoa liquor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stared around at the trays and trays of fondant cremes, marzipans and caramels. Oh, and here was an entire table of Soul Cake eggs. But these weren't the hollow-shelled, cardboard-tasting presents for children, oh, no—these were the confectionery equivalent of fine, intricate jewellery.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Out of the corner of her eye she saw movement. One of the statue-like workers bent over her tray of Praline Dreams was shifting almost imperceptibly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Time was flowing into the room. Pale blue light glinted in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She turned and saw a vaguely human figure hovering beside her. It was featureless and as transparent as mist, but in her head it said, <em class="calibre9">I'm stronger. You are my anchor, my link to this world. Can you guess how hard it is to find it again in so many? Get me to the clock</em>…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan turned and thrust the icing syringe into the arms of the groaning Myria. “Grab that. And make some kind of… of sling or something. I want you to be carrying as many of those chocolate eggs as possible. And the cremes. And the liqueurs. Understand? You can do it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Oh, gods, there was no alternative. The poor thing needed some kind of morale boost. “<em class="calibre9">Please</em>, Myria? And that's a stupid name! You're not many, you're one. Okay? Just be… yourself. Unity… that'd be a <em class="calibre9">good </em>name.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The new Unity raised a mascara-streaked face. “Yes, it is, it's a good name…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan snatched as much merchandise as she could carry, aware of some rustling behind her, and turned to find Unity standing to attention holding, by the look of it, a benchworth of assorted confectionery in…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">…a sort of big cerise sack.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh. Good. Intelligent use of the materials to hand,” said Susan weakly. Then the teacher within her cut in and added, “I hope you brought enough for <em class="calibre9">everybody</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“You were the first,” said Lu-Tze. “You basically <em class="calibre9">created </em>the whole business. Innovative, you were.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That was then,” said Ronnie Soak. “It's all changed now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not like it used to be,” agreed Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Take Death,” said Ronnie Soak. “Impressive, I'll grant you, and who doesn't look good in black? But, after all, Death… What's death?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a big sleep,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just a big sleep,” said Ronnie Soak. “As for the others… War? If war's so bad, why do people keep doing it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Practically a hobby,” said Lu-Tze. He began to roll himself a cigarette.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Practically a hobby,” said Ronnie Soak. “As for Famine and Pestilence, well…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Enough said,” said Lu-Tze sympathetically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Exactly. I mean, Famine's a fearful thing, obviously—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—in an agricultural community, but you've got to move with the times,” said Lu-Tze, putting the roll-up in his mouth.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's it,” said Ronnie. “You've got to move with the times. I mean, does your average city person fear famine?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, he thinks food grows in shops,” said Lu-Tze. He was beginning to enjoy this. He had eight hundred years' worth of experience in steering the thoughts of his superiors, and most of them had been <em class="calibre9">intelligent</em>. He decided to strike out a little.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fire, now: city folk really fear fire,” he said. “<em class="calibre9">That's </em>new. Your primitive villager, he reckoned fire was a good thing, didn't he? Kept the wolves away. If it burned down his hut, well, logs and turf are cheap enough. But now he lives in a street of crowded wooden houses and everyone's cooking in their rooms, well—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie glared.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fire? <em class="calibre9">Fire</em>? Just a demi-god! Some little tea-leaf pinches the flame from the gods and suddenly he's immortal? You call that training and experience?” A spark leapt from Ronnie's fingers and ignited the end of Lu-Tze's cigarette. “And as for gods—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Johnny-come-latelys, the pack of 'em,” said Lu-Tze quickly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right! People started worshipping them because they were afraid of me,” said Ronnie. “Did you know that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, really?” said Lu-Tze innocently.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But now Ronnie sagged. “That was then, of course,” he said. “It's different now. I'm not what I used to be.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, no, obviously not, no,” said Lu-Tze soothingly. “But it's all a matter of how you look at it, am I correct? Now, supposing a man—that is to say a—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Anthropomorphic personification,” said Ronnie Soak. “But I've always preferred the term ‘avatar’.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze's brow wrinkled. “You fly around a lot?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That would be aviator.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sorry. Well, supposing an avatar, thank you, who was perhaps a bit ahead of his time thousands of years ago, well, supposing he took a good look around now, he might just find the world is ready for him again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze waited. “My abbot, now, he reckons you are the bees' knees,” he said, for a little reinforcement.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Does he?” said Ronnie Soak suspiciously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bee's knees, cat's pyjamas and dog's… elbows,” Lu-Tze finished. “He's written scrolls and scrolls about you. Says you are hugely important in understanding how the universe works.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah, but… he's just one man,” said Ronnie Soak, with all the sullen reluctance of someone cuddling a lifetime's huge snit like a favourite soft toy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Technically, yes,” said Lu-Tze. “But he's an abbot. And brainy? He thinks such big thoughts he needs a second lifetime just to finish them off! Let a lot of peasants fear famine, I say, but someone like you should aim for <em class="calibre9">quality</em>. And you look at the cities, now. Back in the old days there were just heaps of mud bricks with names like Ur and Uh and Ugg. These days there's <em class="calibre9">millions </em>of people living in cities. Very, very complicated cities. Just you think about what they really, <em class="calibre9">really </em>fear. And fear… well, fear <em class="calibre9">is </em>belief. Hmm?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was another long pause.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, all right, but…” Ronnie began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course, they won't be living in 'em very long, because by the time the grey people have finished taking them to pieces to see how they work there won't be any belief <em class="calibre9">left</em>.” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“My customers do depend on me…” Ronnie Soak mumbled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What customers? That's Soak speaking,” said Lu-Tze. “That's not the voice of Kaos.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah!” said Kaos bitterly. “You haven't told me yet how you worked that one out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Because I've got more than three brain cells and you're vain and you painted your actual name back to front on your cart whether you knew it or not, and a dark window is a mirror, and K and S are still recognizable in a reflection even when they're back to front, thought Lu-Tze. But that wasn't a good way forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It was just obvious,” he said. “You sort of shine through. It's like putting a sheet over an elephant. You might not be able to <em class="calibre9">see </em>it, but you're sure the elephants still there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Kaos looked wretched.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know,” he said, “it's been a long time—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh? And I thought you said you were Number One?” said Lu-Tze, deciding on a new approach. “Sorry! Still, I suppose it's not your fault you've lost a few skills over the centuries, what with one thing and—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lost skills?” snapped Kaos, waving a finger under the sweeper's nose. “I could certainly take <em class="calibre9">you </em>to the cleaners, you little maggot!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What with? A dangerous yoghurt?” said Lu-Tze, climbing off the cart.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Kaos leapt down after him. “Where do you get off, talking to me like that?” he demanded.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze glanced up. “Corner of Merchant and Broad Way,” he said. “So what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Kaos roared. He tore off his striped apron and his white cap. He seemed to grow in size. Darkness evaporated off him like smoke.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze folded his hands and grinned. “Remember Rule One,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Rules? Rules? I'm Kaos!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who was the first?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Creator and Destroyer?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Damn right!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Apparently complicated, apparently patternless behaviour that nevertheless has a simple, deterministic explanation and is a key to new levels of understanding of the multidimensional universe?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'd better believe it—What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Got to move with the times, mister, got to keep up!” shouted Lu-Tze excitedly, hopping from foot to foot. “You're what people think you are! And they've changed you! I hope you're good at sums!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You can't tell <em class="calibre9">me </em>what to <em class="calibre9">be</em>!” Kaos roared. “I'm Kaos!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't think so? Well, your big comeback ain't gonna happen now that the Auditors have taken over! The <em class="calibre9">rules</em>, mister! That's what they are! Theyre the cold dead <em class="calibre9">rules</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Silver lightning flickered in the walking cloud that had once been Ronnie. Then cloud, cart and horse vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, could have been worse, I suppose,” said Lu-Tze to himself. “Not a very bright lad, really. Possibly a bit too old-fashioned.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He turned round and found a crowd of Auditors watching him. There were dozens of them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He sighed and grinned his sheepish little grin. He'd had just about enough for one day.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well I expect <em class="calibre9">you </em>have heard of Rule One, right?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">That seemed to give them pause. One said, “We know millions of rules, human.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Billions. Trillions,” said another.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well you can't attack <em class="calibre9">me</em>,” said Lu-Tze, “'cos of Rule One.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The nearest Auditors went into a huddle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It must involve gravitation.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, quantum effects. Obviously.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Logically there cannot be a Rule One because at that point there would be no concept of plurality.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But if there is not a Rule One, can there be any other rules? If there is no Rule One, where is Rule Two?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There are millions of rules! They cannot fail to be numbered!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wonderful thought Lu-Tze. All I have to do is wait until their heads melt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But an Auditor stepped forward. It looked more wild-eyed than the others, and was much more unkempt. It was also carrying an axe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We do not have to discuss this!” it snapped. “We must think: This is nonsense, we will not discuss it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But what is Rule—” an Auditor began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You will call me Mr White!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mr White, what <em class="calibre9">is </em>Rule One?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am not glad you asked that question!” screamed Mr White, and swung the axe. The body of the other Auditor crumbled in around the blade, dissolving into floating motes that dispersed in a fine cloud.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Anyone <em class="calibre9">else </em>got any questions?” said Mr White, raising the axe again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One or two Auditors, not yet entirely in tune with current developments, opened their mouths to speak. And shut them again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze took a few steps back. He prided himself on an incredibly well-honed ability to talk his way in or out of anything, but that rather depended on a passably sane entity being involved at the other end of the dialogue.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White turned to Lu-Tze. “What are you doing out of your place, organic?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But Lu-Tze was overhearing another, whispered conversation. It was coming from the other side of a nearby wall, and it went like this:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Who cares about the damn wording</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Accuracy is important, Susan. There is a precise description on the little map inside the lid. Look</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">And you think that will impress anyone</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Please. Things should be done properly</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Oh, give it to me, then</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White advanced on Lu-Tze, axe raised. “It is forbidden to—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Eat</em>… <em class="calibre9">Oh, good grief</em>… <em class="calibre9">Eat</em>… ‘<em class="calibre9">a delicious fondant sugar creme infused with delightfully rich and creamy raspberry filling wrapped in mysterious dark chocolate</em>’… <em class="calibre9">you grey bastards</em>!” </div>
      <div class="paragraph">A shower of small objects pattered down on the street. Several of them broke open.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze heard a whine or, rather, the silence caused by the absence of a whine he'd grown used to.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, no, I'm winding dow…”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Trailing smoke, but looking more like a milkman again, albeit one that'd just delivered to a blazing house, Ronnie Soak stormed into his dairy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who does he think he is?” he muttered, gripping the spotless edge of a counter so hard that the metal bent. “Hah, oh yes, they just toss you aside, but when they want you to make a comeback—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Under his fingers the metal went white hot and then dripped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've got customers. I've got customers. People depend on me. It might not be a glamorous job, but people will always need milk—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He clapped a hand to his forehead. Where the molten metal touched his skin the metal evaporated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The headache was really <em class="calibre9">bad</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He could remember the time when there was only him. It was <em class="calibre9">hard </em>to remember, because… there <em class="calibre9">was </em>nothing, no colour, no sound, no pressure, no time, no spin, no light, no life…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Just Kaos.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And the thought arose: Do I want that again? The perfect order that goes with changelessness?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">More thoughts were following that one, like little silvery eels in his mind. He was, after all, a Horseman, and had been ever since the time the people in mud cities on baking plains put together some hazy idea of Something that had existed before anyone else. And a Horseman picks up the noises of the world. The mud-city people and the skin-tent people, they'd known instinctively that the world swirled perilously through a complex and uncaring multiverse, that life was lived a mirrors thickness from the cold of space and the gulfs of night. They knew that everything they called reality, the web of rules that made life happen, was a bubble on the tide. They <em class="calibre9">feared </em>old Kaos. But now—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He opened his eyes and looked down at his dark, smoking hands. To the world in general, he said, “Who am I now?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze <em class="calibre9">heard </em>his voice speed up from nothing: “—wn…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, you're wound up again,” said a young woman in front of him. She stood back, giving him a critical look. Lu-Tze, for the first time in eight hundred years, felt that he'd been caught doing something wrong. It was that kind of expression—searching, rummaging around inside his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You'll be Lu-Tze, then,” said Susan. “I'm Susan Sto Helit. No time for explanations. You've been out for… well, not for long. We have to get Lobsang to the glass clock. Are you any good? Lobsang thinks you're a bit of a fraud.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only a bit? I'm surprised.” Lu-Tze looked around. “What happened here?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The street was empty, except for the ever-present statues. But scraps of silver paper and coloured wrappers littered the ground, and across the wall behind him was a long splash of what looked very much like chocolate icing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Some of them got away,” said Susan, picking up what Lu-Tze could only hope was a giant icing syringe. “Mostly they fought with one another. Would <em class="calibre9">you </em>try to tear someone apart just for a coffee creme?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze looked into those eyes. After eight hundred years you learn how to read people. And Susan was a story that went back a very long way. She probably even knew about Rule One, and didn't care. This was someone to treat with respect. But you couldn't let even someone like her have it all their own way.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The kind with a coffee bean on the top, or the ordinary kind?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The kind without the coffee bean, I think,” said Susan, holding his gaze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nnn-o. No. No, I don't think I would,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But they are learning,” said a woman's voice behind the sweeper. “Some resisted. We <em class="calibre9">can </em>learn. That's how humans became humans.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze regarded the speaker. She looked like a society lady who had just had a really bad day in a threshing machine.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can I just be clear here?” he said, staring from one woman to the other. “You've been fighting the grey people with <em class="calibre9">chocolate</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Susan, peering round the corner. “It's the sensory explosion. They lose control of their morphic field. Can you throw at all? Good. Unity, give him as many chocolate eggs as he can carry. The secret is to get them to land hard so that there's lots of shrapnel—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And where is Lobsang?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Him? You could say he's with us in spirit.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were blue sparkles in the air.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Growing pains, I think,” Susan added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Centuries of experience once again came to Lu-Tze's aid.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He always looked like a lad who needed to find himself,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Susan. “And it came as a bit of a shock. Let's go.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Death looked down at the world. Timelessness had reached the Rim now, and was expanding into the universe at the speed of light. The Discworld was a sculpture in crystal.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Not <em class="calibre9">an </em>apocalypse. There had always been plenty of those—small apocalypses, not the full shilling at all, fake apocalypses: apocryphal apocalypses. Most of them had been back in the old days, when the world as in “end of the world” was often objectively no wider than a few villages and a clearing in the forest.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And those little worlds had ended. But there had always been <em class="calibre9">somewhere else</em>. There had been the horizon, to start with. The fleeing refugees would find that the world was bigger than they'd thought. A few villages in a clearing? Hah, how could they have been so stupid! <em class="calibre9">Now </em>they knew it was a whole island! Of course, there was that horizon again…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The world had run out of horizons.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As Death watched, the sun stopped in its orbit and its light became duller, redder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He sighed, and nudged Binky. The horse stepped forward, in a direction that could not be found on any map.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And the sky was full of grey shapes. There was a ripple in the ranks of Auditors as the Pale Horse trotted forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One drifted towards Death and hung in the air a few feet away. It said, <em class="calibre9">Should you not be riding out?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">DO YOU SPEAK FOR ALL ?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">You know the custom</em>, said the voice in Death's mind. <em class="calibre9">Among us, one speaks for all</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WHAT IS BEING DONE IS WRONG.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">It is not your business</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NEVERTHELESS, WE ARE ALL ANSWERABLE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">The universe will last for ever</em>, said the voice. <em class="calibre9">Everything preserved, ordered, understood, lawful, filed</em>… <em class="calibre9">changeless</em>. A perfect world. Finished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">NO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">It will all end one day in any case</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BUT THIS IS TOO SOON. THERE IS <em class="calibre9">UNFINISHED </em>BUSINESS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">And that is—?</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">EVERYTHING.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And, with a flash of light, a figure clothed all in white appeared, holding a book in one hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It looked from Death to the endlessly massing ranks of the Auditors, and said: “Sorry? Is this the right place?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Two Auditors were measuring the number of atoms in a paving slab.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They looked up at a movement.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good afternoon,” said Lu-Tze. “May I draw your attention to the notice my assistant is holding up?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan held up the sign. It read: Mouths Must Be Open. By Order.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And Lu-Tze unfolded his hands. There was a caramel in each one, and he was a good shot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The mouths shut. The faces went impassive. Then there was a sound somewhere between a purr and a wail, which disappeared into the ultrasonic. And then… the Auditors dissolved, gently, first going fuzzy around the edges and, as the process accelerated, swiftly becoming a spreading cloud.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hand-to-mouth fighting,” said Lu-Tze. “Why doesn't it happen to humans?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It nearly does,” said Susan, and when they stared at her she blinked and said, “To stupid, indulgent humans, anyway.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">You </em>don't have to concentrate to stay the same shape,” said Unity. “And that was the last of the caramels, by the way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, there's six in one of W&amp;B's Gold Selections,” said Susan. “Three have got white chocolate cream in dark chocolate and three have got whipped cream in milk chocolate. They're the ones in the silver wrapp—Look, I just happen to <em class="calibre9">know </em>things, all right? Let's keep going, okay? Without mentioning chocolate.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">You have no power over us</em>, said the Auditor. <em class="calibre9">We are not <strong class="calibre12">alive</strong></em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BUT YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING ARROGANCE, PRIDE AND STUPIDITY. THESE ARE EMOTIONS. I WOULD SAY THEY ARE SIGNS OF LIFE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Excuse me?” said the shining figure in white.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">But you are all <strong class="calibre12">alone</strong> here!</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Excuse <em class="calibre9">me</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES? said Death. WHAT IS IT?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is <em class="calibre9">the </em>Apocalypse, yes?” said the shining figure petulantly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WE ARE <em class="calibre9">TALKING</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, right, but <em class="calibre9">is </em>it the Apocalypse? The actual end of the actual whole world?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">No</em>, said the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES, said Death. IT IS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Great!” said the figure.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">What</em>? said the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WHAT? said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The figure looked embarrassed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, not great, <em class="calibre9">obviously</em>. Obviously not <em class="calibre9">great</em>, as such. But it's what I'm here for. It's what I'm <em class="calibre9">for</em>, really.” It held up the book. “Er… I've got the place marked ready. Wow! It's been, you know, so long…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death glanced at the book. The cover and all the pages were made of iron. Realization dawned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU ARE THE ANGEL CLOTHED ALL IN WHITE OF THE IRON BOOK FROM THE PROPHECIES OF TOBRUN, AM I CORRECT?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's right!” The pages clanged as the angel hurriedly thumbed through them. “And it's clothed, by the way, if you don't mind. Clo-the<em class="calibre9">ddd</em>. Just a detail, I know, but I like to get it right.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">What is happening here</em>? the Auditor growled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, said Death, ignoring the interruption. BUT YOU ARE NOT OFFICIAL.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The pages stopped clanking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do you mean?” said the angel suspiciously.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THE BOOK OF TOBRUN HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED OFFICIAL CHURCH DOGMA FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. THE PROPHET BRUTHA REVEALED THAT THE WHOLE CHAPTER WAS A METAPHOR FOR A POWER STRUGGLE WITHIN THE EARLY CHURCH. IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE REVISED VERSION OF THE BOOK OF OM, AS DETERMINED BY THE CONVOCATION OF EE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not at all?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I'M SORRY.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've been thrown out? Just like the damn rabbits and the big syrupy things?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Even the bit where I blow the trumpet?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">OH, YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You sure?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">ALWAYS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you are Death and this is the Apocalypse, right?” said the angel, looking wretched. “So therefore—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, YOU ARE NO LONGER A FORMAL PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Out of the corner of his mind, Death was observing the Auditor. Auditors always listened when people spoke. The more people spoke, the closer to consensus every decision came, and the less responsibility anyone had. But the Auditor was showing signs of impatience and annoyance…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Emotions. And emotions made you <em class="calibre9">alive</em>. Death knew how to deal with the living.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The angel looked around at the universe. “Then what am <em class="calibre9">I </em>supposed to <em class="calibre9">do</em>?” he wailed. “This is what I've been waiting for! For thousands of years!” He stared at the iron book. “Thousands of dull, boring, wasted years…” he mumbled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Have you quite finished</em>? said the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One big scene. That's all I had. That was my <em class="calibre9">purpose</em>. You wait, you practise—and then you're just edited out because brimstone is no longer a fashionable colour?” Anger was infusing the bitterness in the angel's voice. “No one told <em class="calibre9">me</em>, of course…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He glared at the rusted pages. “It ought to be Pestilence next,” he muttered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Am I late, then?” said a voice in the night.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A horse walked forward. It gleamed unhealthily, like a gangrenous wound just before the barber-surgeon would be called in with his hacksaw for a quick trim.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING, said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't want to,” Pestilence oozed, “but humans do get such interesting diseases. I'd rather like to see how weasles turn out, too.” One crusted eye winked at Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean measles?” said the angel.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Weasles, I'm afraid,” said Pestilence. “People are getting really careless with this bio-artificing. We're talking boil's that really <em class="calibre9">bite</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Two of you will not suffice</em>! snarled the Auditor in their heads.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A horse walked out of the darkness. Some toast racks had more flesh.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I've been thinking,” said a voice. “Maybe there are things worth putting up a fight for.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And they are—?” said Pestilence, looking round.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Salad-cream sandwiches. You just can't beat them. That tang of permitted emulsifiers? Marvellous.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! You're Famine, then?” said the Angel of the Iron Book. It fumbled with the heavy pages again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">What, what, what is this nonsense of “salad cream</em>”?<a href="#TOT_APF18" title="18. If you live in a country where the tradition calls for mayonnaise, just don't ask. Just don't."><sup class="calibre10">18</sup></a> shouted the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Anger, thought Death. A <em class="calibre9">powerful </em>emotion.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do I like salad cream?” said a voice in the dark.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A second, female voice replied: “No, dear, it gives you hives.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The horse of War was huge and red and the heads of dead warriors hung from the saddle horn. And Mrs War was hanging on to War, grimly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All four. Bingo!” said the Angel of the Iron Book. “So much for the Convocation of Ee!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War had a woolly scarf round his neck. He looked sheepishly at the other Horsemen.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's not to strain himself,” said Mrs War sharply. “And you're not to let him do anything dangerous. He's not as strong as he thinks. And he gets confused.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">So, the gang is all here</em>, said the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Smugness, Death noticed. And self-satisfaction.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a clanging as of metal pages. The Angel of the Iron Book was looking puzzled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Actually, I don't think that's entirely correct,” it said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">No one paid it any attention.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Off you go on your little pantomime</em>, said the Auditor.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And now irony and sarcasm, thought Death. They must be picking it up from the ones down in the world. All the little things that go to make up a… <em class="calibre9">personality</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked along the row of Horsemen. They caught his eye, and there were almost imperceptible nods from Famine and Pestilence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War turned in the saddle and spoke to his wife. “Right now, dear, I'm not confused at all. Could you get down, please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Remember what happened when—” Mrs War began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Right now</em>, please, my dear,” said War, and this time his voice, which was still calm and polite, had echoes of steel and bronze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er… oh.” Mrs War was suddenly flustered. “That was just how you used to talk when—” She stopped, blushed happily for a moment, and slid off the horse.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War nodded at Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">And now you must all go and bring terror and destruction and so on and so forth</em>, said the Auditor. <em class="calibre9">Correct?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death nodded. Floating in the air above him, the Angel of the Iron Book slammed the pages back and forth in an effort to find his place.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">EXACTLY. ONLY, WHILE IT IS TRUE WE HAVE TO RIDE OUT, Death added, drawing his sword, IT DOESN'T SAY ANYWHERE AGAINST <em class="calibre9">WHOM</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Your meaning</em>? hissed the Auditor, but now there was a flicker of fear. Things were happening that it didn't understand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death grinned. In order to fear, you had to be a <em class="calibre9">me</em>. Don't let anything happen to <em class="calibre9">me</em>. That was the song of fear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He means,” said War, “That he asked us all to think about whose side we're really on.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Four swords were drawn, blazing along their edges like flame. Four horses charged.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Angel of the Iron Book looked down at Mrs War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Excuse me,” he said, “but do you have a pencil?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan peered round the corner into Artificers Street, and groaned. “It's full of them… and I think they've gone mad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Unity took a look. “No. They have not gone mad. They are being Auditors. They are taking measurements, assessing and standardizing where necessary.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're taking up the paving slabs now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I suspect it is because they are the wrong size. We do not like irregularities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What the hell is the wrong size for a slab of rock?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Any size that is not the average size. I'm sorry.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The air around Susan flashed blue. She was very briefly aware of a human shape, transparent, spinning gently, which vanished again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But a voice in her ear, <em class="calibre9">in </em>her ear said: <em class="calibre9">Nearly strong enough. Can you get to the end of the street?</em></div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. Are you sure? You couldn't do anything to the clock before!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Before, I was not me</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A movement in the air made Susan look up. The lightning bolt that had stood rigid over the dead city had gone. The clouds were rolling like ink poured into water. There were flashes within them, sulphurous yellows and reds.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">The Four Horsemen are fighting the other Auditors</em>, Lobsang supplied.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are they winning?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang did not answer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I said—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">It's hard for me to say. I can see… everything. Everything that could be</em>…</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Kaos listened to history.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were new words. Wizards and philosophers had found Chaos, which is Kaos with his hair combed and a tie on, and had found in the epitome of disorder a new order undreamed of. <em class="calibre9">There are different kinds of rules</em>. From the simple comes the complex, and from the complex comes a different kind of simplicity. Chaos is order in a mask…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Chaos. Not dark, ancient Kaos, left behind by the evolving universe, but new, shiny Chaos, dancing in the heart of everything. The idea was strangely attractive. And it was a reason to go on living.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie Soak adjusted his cap. Oh, yes… there was one last thing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The milk was always lovely and fresh. Everyone remarked on that. Of course, being <em class="calibre9">everywhere </em>at seven in the morning was no trouble to him. If even the Hogfather could climb down every chimney in the world in one night, doing a milk round for most of a city in one second was hardly a major achievement.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Keeping things cool <em class="calibre9">was</em>, however. But there he had been lucky. Mr Soak walked into the ice room, where his breath turned to fog in the frigid air. Churns were stacked across the floor, sparkling on the outside. Vats of butter and cream were piled on shelves that glistened with ice. Rack after rack of eggs were just visible through the frost. He'd been planning to add the ice-cream business in the summer. It was such an obvious step. Besides, he needed to use up the cold.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A stove was burning in the middle of the floor. Mr Soak always bought good coal from the dwarfs, and the iron plates were glowing red. The room, one felt, ought to be an oven, but there was a gentle sizzling on the stove as frost battled with the heat. With the stove roaring, the room was merely an ice-box. Without the stove…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie opened the door of a white-rimed cupboard and smashed at the ice within with his fist. Then he reached inside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">What emerged, crackling with blue flame, was a sword.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a work of art, the sword. It had imaginary velocity, negative energy and positive cold, cold so cold that it met heat coming the other way and took on something of its nature. <em class="calibre9">Burning </em>cold. There had never been anything as cold as this since before the universe began. In fact, it seemed to Chaos, <em class="calibre9">everything </em>since then had been merely lukewarm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, I'm back,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Fifth Horseman rode out, and a faint smell of cheese followed him.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Unity looked at the other two, and at the blue glow that still hovered around the group. They had taken cover behind a fruit barrow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If I may make a suggestion,” she said, “it is that w—that Auditors are not good with surprises. The impulse is always to consult. And the assumption is always that there will be a plan.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I suggest total madness. I suggest you and… and the… young man run for the shop, and I will attract the attention of the Auditors. I believe this old man should assist me because he will die soon in any case.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was silence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Accurate yet unnecessary,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That was not good etiquette?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It could have been better. However, is it not written, ‘When you have got to go, you have got to go’ ?” said Lu-Tze. “And also that, ‘You should always wear clean underwear because you never know if you will be knocked down by a cart’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Will it help?” said Unity, looking very puzzled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That is one of the great mysteries of the Way,” said Lu-Tze, nodding sagely. “What chocolate do we have left?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're down to the nougat now,” said Unity. “And I believe nougat is a terrible thing to cover with chocolate, where it can ambush the unsuspecting. Susan?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan was peering up the street. “Mmm?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you have any chocolate left?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan shook her head. “Mmm-mmm.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I believe you were carrying the cherry cremes?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Mmm?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan swallowed, and then gave a cough that expressed, in a remarkably concise way, embarrassment <em class="calibre9">and </em>annoyance.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just had one!” she snapped. “I need the sugar.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sure no one said you did have more than one,” said Unity meekly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We haven't been counting at <em class="calibre9">all</em>,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If you have a handkerchief,” said Unity, still diplomatically, “I could wipe away the chocolate around your mouth which must have inadvertently got there during the last engagement.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan glared and used the back of her hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's just the sugar,” she said. “That's all. It's fuel. And do stop going on about it! Look, we can't just let you die to get—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Yes, we can</em>, said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?” said Susan, shocked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Because I have seen everything</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Would you like to tell everyone?” said Susan, reverting to Classroom Sarcasm. “We'd all like to know how this ends!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">You misunderstand the meaning of “everything”</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze rummaged in his sack of ammunition and produced two chocolate eggs and a paper bag. Unity went white at the sight of the bag.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I didn't know we had any of those!” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good, are they?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Coffee beans coated in chocolate,” breathed Susan. “They should be outlawed!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The two women watched in horror as Lu-Tze put one in his mouth. He gave them a surprised look.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Quite nice, but I prefer liquorice,” he said. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean you don't want another one?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you <em class="calibre9">sure</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I'd quite like liquorice, though, if you have any…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Have you had some special monk training?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, not in chocolate combat, no,” said Lu-Tze. “But is it not written, ‘If you have another one you won't have an appetite for your dinner’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You really mean you will <em class="calibre9">not </em>eat a second chocolate coffee bean?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked across at Unity, who was trembling. “You <em class="calibre9">do </em>have tastebuds, don't you?” she said, but she felt a pressure on her arm pulling her away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You two get behind that cart over there and run when you get the signal,” said Lu-Tze. “Go now!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What signal?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">We'll know</em>, said the voice of Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze watched them hurry away. Then he picked up his broom in one hand and stepped out into the view of a street full of grey people.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Excuse me?” he said. “Could I have your attention, please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is he doing?” said Susan, crouching behind the cart.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">They're all going towards him</em>, said Lobsang. <em class="calibre9">Some of them have weapons</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They'll be the ones giving the orders,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Are you sure?</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. They've learned from humans. Auditors aren't used to taking orders. They need persuading.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">He's telling them about Rule One, and that means he's got a plan. I think it's working. Yes!</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's he done? What's he done?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Come on! He'll be fine!</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan leapt up. “Good!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Yes, they've cut his head off</em>…</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Fear, anger, envy… Emotions bring you alive, which is a brief period just before you die. The grey shapes fled in front of the swords.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But there were billions of them. And they had their own ways of fighting. Passive, subtle ways.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is stupid!” Pestilence shouted. “They can't even catch a common cold!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No soul to damn, no arse to kick!” said War, hacking at grey shreds that rolled away from his blade.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They have a kind of hunger,” said Famine. “I just can't find a way to get at it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The horses were reined in. The wall of greyness hovered in the distance, and began to close in again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THEY ARE FIGHTING BACK, said Death. CAN YOU NOT FEEL IT?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I just feel we're too damn stupid,” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AND WHERE DOES THAT FEELING COME FROM?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you saying they're affecting our minds?” said Pestilence. “We're Horsemen! How can they do that to <em class="calibre9">us</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WE HAVE BECOME TOO HUMAN.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Us? Human? Don't make me lau—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">LOOK AT THE SWORD IN YOUR HAND, said Death. DON'T YOU NOTICE ANYTHING?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's a sword. Sword-shaped. Well?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">LOOK AT THE HAND. FOUR FINGERS AND A THUMB. A <em class="calibre9">HUMAN </em>HAND. HUMANS GAVE YOU THAT SHAPE. AND THAT IS THE WAY IN. <em class="calibre9">LISTEN</em>! DO YOU NOT FEEL SMALL IN A BIG UNIVERSE? THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SINGING. IT IS BIG AND YOU ARE SMALL AND AROUND YOU THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE COLD OF SPACE AND YOU ARE SO VERY ALONE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The other three Horsemen looked unsettled, nervous.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's coming from them?” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. IT IS THE FEAR AND HATRED THAT MATTER HAS FOR LIFE AND THEY ARE THE BEARERS OF THAT HATRED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then what can we do?” said Pestilence. “There're too many of them!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">DID YOU THINK THAT THOUGHT, OR DID THEY? Death snapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They're coming closer again,” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THEN WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Four swords against an army? That'll never work!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT A FEW MOMENTS AGO. WHO IS TALKING FOR YOU NOW? HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS FACED <em class="calibre9">US </em>AND THEY HAVE NOT SURRENDERED.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, <em class="calibre9">yes</em>,” said Pestilence. “But with <em class="calibre9">us </em>they could always hope for a remission.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Or a sudden truce,” said War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Or—” Famine began, and hesitated, and said finally, “A shower of fish?” He looked at their expressions. “That actually happened once,” he added defiantly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IN ORDER TO HAVE A CHANGE OF FORTUNE AT THE LAST MINUTE YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR FORTUNE TO THE LAST MINUTE, said Death. WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And if that doesn't work?” said Pestilence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death gathered up Binky's reins. The Auditors were much closer now. He could make out their individual, identical shapes. Remove one, and there were always a dozen more.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">THEN WE DID WHAT WE COULD, he said, UNTIL WE COULD NOT.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On his cloud, the Angel Clothed all in White wrestled with the Iron Book.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are they talking about?” said Mrs War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't know, I can't hear! And these two pages are stuck together!” said the angel. It scrabbled ineffectively at them for a moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is all because he wouldn't wear his vest,” said Mrs War firmly. “It's just the sort of thing I—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She had to stop because the angel had wrenched the halo from its head and was dragging it down the fused edge of the pages, with sparks and a sound like a cat slipping down a blackboard.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The pages clanged apart.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right, let's see…” It scanned the newly revealed text. “Done that… done that… oh…” It stopped and turned a pale face to Mrs War.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, boy,” it said, “we're in trouble now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A comet sprang up from the world below, growing visibly larger as the angel spoke. It flamed across the sky, burning fragments detaching and dropping away and revealing, as it closed with the Horsemen, a chariot on fire.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was a blue flame. Chaos burned with cold.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The figure standing in the chariot wore a full-face helmet dominated by two eye holes that looked slightly like the wings of a butterfly and rather more like the eyes of some strange, alien creature. The burning horse, barely sweating, trotted to a halt; the other horses, regardless of their riders, moved aside to make room.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, no,” said Famine, waving a hand in disgust. “Not him, too? I said what'd happen if he came back, didn't I? Remember that time he threw the minstrel out of the hotel window in Zok? Didn't I say—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SHUT UP, said Death. He nodded. HELLO, RONNIE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD COME.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A hand trailing cold steam came up and removed the helmet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hello, boys,” said Chaos pleasantly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Uh… long time no see,” said Pestilence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">War coughed. “Heard you were doing well,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, indeed,” said Ronnie, in a careful tone of voice. “There's a real future in the retail milk and milk derivatives business.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death glanced at the Auditors. They'd stopped moving in but were circling, watchfully.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, the world will always need cheese,” said War desperately. “Haha.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Looks like there's some trouble here,” said Ronnie.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We can handl—” Famine began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">WE CAN'T, said Death. YOU CAN SEE HOW IT IS, RONNIE. TIMES HAVE CHANGED. WOULD YOU CARE TO SIT IN FOR THIS ONE?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hey, we haven't discussed—” Famine began, but stopped when War glared at him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Ronnie Soak put on his helmet, and Chaos drew his sword. It glinted and, like the glass clock, looked like the intrusion into the world of something a great deal more complex.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Some old man told me you live and learn,” he said. “Well. I have lived, and now I've learned that the edge of a sword is infinitely long. I've also learned how to make damn good yoghurt, although this is not a skill I intend to employ today. Shall we go get 'em, boys?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Far down, in the street, a few of the Auditors moved forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What <em class="calibre9">is </em>Rule One?” said one of them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It does not matter. I am Rule One!” An Auditor with a big axe waved them back. “Obedience is necessary!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Auditors wavered, watching the cleaver. They'd learned about pain. They'd never felt pain before, not in billions of years. Those who had felt it had no desire at all to feel it again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very well,” said Mr White. “Now get back to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A chocolate egg spun out of nowhere and smashed on the stones. The crowd of Auditors rippled forward, but Mr White slashed the axe through the air a few times.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Stand back! Stand back!” he screamed. “You three! Find out who threw that! It came from behind that stall! No one is to touch the brown material!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stooped carefully and picked up a large fragment of chocolate, on which could just be made out the shape of a smiling duck in yellow icing. Hand shaking and sweat beading his forehead, he raised it aloft and flourished the cleaver triumphantly. There was a collective sigh from the crowd. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You see?” he shouted. “The body can be overcome! You see? We <em class="calibre9">can </em>find a way to live! If you are good, there may be brown material! If you disobey, there <em class="calibre9">will </em>be the sharp edge! Ah…” He lowered his arms as a struggling Unity was dragged towards him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The pathfinder,” he said, “the renegade…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He walked towards the captive. “What will it be?” he said. “The cleaver or the brown material?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's called chocolate,” snapped Unity. “I do not eat it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We shall see,” Mr White said. “Your associate seemed to prefer the axe!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He pointed to the body of Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To the empty patch of cobbles where Lu-Tze had been.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A hand tapped him on the shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why is it,” said a voice by his ear, “that <em class="calibre9">no one </em>ever believes in Rule One?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Above him the sky began to burn blue.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sped up the street to the clock shop.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She glanced sideways, and Lobsang was there, running beside her. He looked… human, except that not many humans had a blue glow around them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There will be grey men around the clock!” he shouted.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Trying to find what makes it tick?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! Yes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you going to do?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Smash it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That'll destroy history!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached out and took her hand. She felt a shock run up her arm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You won't need to open the door! You won't need to stop! Head straight for the clock!” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't talk to me! I've got to remember!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Remember what?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Everything!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White was already raising the axe as he turned round. But you just can't trust a body. It thinks for itself. When it is surprised, it does a number of things even before the brain has been informed. The mouth opens, for example.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah, good,” said Lu-Tze, raising his cupped hand. “Eat this!”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The door was no more substantial than mist. There <em class="calibre9">were </em>Auditors in the workshop, but Susan moved through them like a ghost.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clock glowed. And, as she ran towards it, it moved away. The floor unrolled in front of her, dragging her back. The clock accelerated towards some distant event horizon. At the same time it grew bigger but became more insubstantial, as if the same amount of clockness was trying to spread itself across more space.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Other things were happening. She blinked, but there was no flicker of darkness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah,” she said to herself, “so I'm not seeing with my eyes. And what else? What's happening to <em class="calibre9">me</em>? My hand… looks normal, but does that mean it is? Am I getting smaller or bigger? Does—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you <em class="calibre9">always </em>like this?” said the voice of Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Like what? I can feel <em class="calibre9">your </em>hand and I can hear your voice—at least, I <em class="calibre9">think </em>I can hear it, but maybe it's just in my head—but I can't feel myself running—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So… so <em class="calibre9">analytical</em>?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course. What am I supposed to be thinking? ‘Oh, my paws and whiskers’? Anyway, it's quite straightforward. It's all metaphorical. My senses are telling me stories because they can't cope with what is <em class="calibre9">really </em>happening—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't let go of my hand.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's all right, I won't let you go.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I <em class="calibre9">meant</em>, don't let go of my hand because otherwise every part of your body will be compressed into a space much, much smaller than an atom.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And don't try to imagine what this <em class="calibre9">really </em>looks like from outside. Here comes the cloooccckkkkkkk—”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr White's mouth closed. His expression of surprise became one of horror, and then one of shock, and then one of terrible, wonderful bliss.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He began to unravel. He came apart like a big and complex jigsaw puzzle made of tiny pieces, crumbling gently at the extremities and then vanishing into the air. The last piece to evaporate was the lips, and then they too were gone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A half-chewed chocolate-coated coffee bean dropped onto the street. Lu-Tze reached down quickly, picked up the axe and flourished it at the other Auditors. They leaned back out of the way, mesmerized by authority.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who does this belong to now?” he demanded. “Come on, whose is it?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is mine! I am Miss Taupe!” shouted a woman in grey.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am Mr Orange and it belongs to me! No one is even sure that taupe is a proper colour!” screamed Mr Orange.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An Auditor in the crowd said, rather more thoughtfully, “Is it the case, then, that hierarchy is negotiable?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Certainly not!” Mr Orange was jumping up and down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You have to decide it amongst yourselves,” said Lu-Tze. He tossed the axe into the air. A hundred pairs of eyes watched it fall.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Mr Orange got there first, but Miss Taupe trod on his fingers. After that, it became very busy and confusing and, to judge by the sounds from within the growing scrum, also very, very painful.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze took the arm of the astonished Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Shall we be going?” he said. “Oh, don't worry about me. I was just desperate enough to try something I'd learned from a yeti. It did sting a bit…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a scream from somewhere in the mob.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Democracy at work,” said Lu-Tze happily. He glanced up. The flames above the world were dying out, and he wondered who'd won.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was bright blue light ahead and dark red light behind, and it amazed Susan how she could see both kinds without opening her eyes and turning her head. Eyes open or shut, she couldn't see herself. All that told her that she was something else besides mere point of view was a slight pressure on what she remembered as her fingers. And the sound of someone laughing, close to her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A voice said, “The sweeper said everyone has to find a teacher and then find their Way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This <em class="calibre9">is </em>my Way. It's the way home.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And then, with a noise that was unromantically very similar to the kind Jason would make by putting a wooden ruler on the edge of his desk and twanging it, the journey ended.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It might not even have begun. The glass clock was in front of her, full size, glittering. There was no blue glow inside. It was just a clock, entirely transparent, and ticking. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked down the length of her arm, and up <em class="calibre9">his </em>arm to Lobsang. He let go of her hand.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We're here,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">With </em>the clock?” said Susan. She could feel herself gasping to get her breath back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is only a part of the clock,” said Lobsang. “The <em class="calibre9">other </em>part.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The bit outside the universe?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. The clock has many dimensions. Do not be afraid.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't think I have ever been afraid of anything in my life,” said Susan, still gulping air. “Not really <em class="calibre9">afraid</em>. I get angry. I'm getting angry now, in fact. Are you Lobsang or are you Jeremy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I walked into that. Are you Lobsang <em class="calibre9">and </em>are you Jeremy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Much closer. Yes. I will always remember both of them. But I would prefer you to call me Lobsang. Lobsang has the better memories. I never liked the name Jeremy even when I <em class="calibre9">was </em>Jeremy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You really <em class="calibre9">are </em>both of them?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am… everything about them that was worth being, I hope. They were very different and they were both me, born just an instant apart, and neither of them was very happy by himself. It makes you wonder if there is anything to astrology after all.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, there is,” said Susan. “Delusion, wishful thinking and gullibility.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't you <em class="calibre9">ever </em>let go?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I haven't yet.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I suppose… because in this world, after everyone panics, there's always got to be someone to tip the wee out of the shoe.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The clock ticked. The pendulum swung. But the hands did not move.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Interesting,” said Lobsang. “You're not a follower of the Way of Mrs Cosmopilite, are you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I don't even know what it is,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Have you got your breath back now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Let's turn around, then.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Personal time moved on again, and a voice behind them said, “Is this yours?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Behind them there were glass steps. At the top of the steps was a man dressed like a History Monk, shaven-headed, besandalled. The eyes gave away a lot more. A young man who'd been alive for a very long time, Mrs Ogg had said, and she had been right.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He was holding a struggling Death of Rats by the scruff of his robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, he's his own,” said Susan, as Lobsang bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then please take him away with you. We cannot have him running around here. Hello, my son.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang walked towards him and they embraced, briefly and formally.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Father,” said Lobsang, straightening up. “This is Susan. She has been… very helpful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course she has,” said the monk, smiling at Susan. “She is helpfulness personified.” He put the Death of Rats on the floor and prodded him forward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I'm very dependable,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And interestingly sarcastic, too,” the monk added. “I am Wen. Thank you for joining us. And for helping our son find himself.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked from the father to the son. The words and the movements were stilted and chilly, but there was a communication going on that she wasn't party to, and it was happening a lot faster than speech.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Aren't we supposed to be saving the world?” she said. “I don't want to rush anybody, of course.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There's something I must do first,” said Lobsang. “I must meet my mother.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Have we got ti—?” Susan began, and then added, “We have, haven't we? All the time in the world.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, no. Far more time than that,” said Wen. “Besides, there's always time to save the world.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Time appeared. Again there was the impression that a figure that was in the air, unfocused, was resolving itself into a million specks of matter that poured together and filled a shape in space, slowly at first and then… someone was there.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She was a tall woman, quite young, dark-haired, wearing a long red-and-black dress. By the look on her face, Susan thought, she had been weeping. But she was smiling now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen took Susan by the arm, and gently pulled her aside.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They'll want to talk,” he said. “Shall we walk?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The room vanished. Now there was a garden, with peacocks and fountains, and a stone seat, upholstered with moss.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lawns unrolled towards woodlands that had the manicured look of an estate that had been maintained for hundreds of years so that nothing grew here that was not wanted, or in the wrong place. Long-tailed birds, their plumage like living jewels, flashed from treetop to treetop. Deeper in the woods, other birds called.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">As Susan watched, a kingfisher alighted on the edge of a fountain. It glanced at her and flew away, its wingbeats sounding like a snapping of tiny fans.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Look,” said Susan, “I don't… I'm not… Look, I <em class="calibre9">understand </em>this sort of thing. Really. I'm not stupid. My grandfather has a garden where everything is black. But Lobsang built the clock! Well, part of him did. So he's saving the world and destroying it, all at once?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Family trait,” said Wen. “It is what Time does at every instant.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He gave Susan the look of a teacher confronted with a keen but stupid pupil.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Think like this,” he said at last. “Think of <em class="calibre9">everything</em>. It's an everyday word. But ‘everything’ means… everything. It's a much bigger word than ‘universe’. And everything contains all possible things that can happen at all possible times in all possible worlds. Don't look for complete solutions in anyone of them. Sooner or later, everything causes everything else.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are you saying one little world is not important, then?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Wen waved a hand, and two glasses of wine appeared on the stone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Everything is as important as everything else,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan grimaced. “You know, that's why I've never liked philosophers,” she said. “They make it all sound grand and simple, and then you step out into a world that's full of <em class="calibre9">complications</em>. I mean, look around. I bet this garden needs regular weeding, and the fountains have to be unblocked, and the peacocks shed feathers and dig up the lawn… and if they <em class="calibre9">don't </em>do that, then this is just a fake.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No, everything is real” said Wen. “At least, it is as real as anything else. But this is a perfect moment.” He smiled at Susan again. “Against one perfect moment, the centuries beat in vain.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'd prefer a more specific philosophy,” said Susan. She tried the wine. It was perfect.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Certainly. I expected that you would. I see you cling to logic as a limpet clings to a rock in a storm. Let me see… Defend the small spaces, don't run with scissors, and remember that there is often an unexpected chocolate,” said Wen. He smiled. “And never resist a perfect moment.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A breeze made the fountains splash over the sides of their bowls, just for a second. Wen stood up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now, I believe my wife and son have finished their meeting,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The garden faded. The stone seat melted like mist as soon as Susan got up, although until then it had felt as solid as, well, rock. The wineglass vanished from her hand, leaving only a memory of its pressure on her fingers and the taste lingering in her mouth. Lobsang was standing in front of the clock. Time herself was not visible, but the song that wove through the rooms now had a different tone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“She's happier,” said Lobsang. “She's free now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked around. Wen had vanished along with the garden. There was nothing but the endless glass rooms.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't you want to talk to your father?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Later. There will be plenty of time,” said Lobsang. “I shall see to it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The way he said it, so carefully dropping the words into place, made her turn.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to take over?” she said. “<em class="calibre9">You </em>are Time now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you're mostly human!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So?” Lobsang's smile took after his father. It was the gentle and, to Susan, the infuriating smile of a god.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What's in all these rooms?” she demanded. “Do you know?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“One perfect moment. In each one. An oodleplex of oodleplexes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm not certain there's such a thing as a genuinely perfect moment,” said Susan. “Can we go home now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang wrapped the edge of his robe around his fist and smashed it against the glass front panel of the clock. It shattered, and dropped to the ground.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“When we get to the other side,” he said, “don't stop and don't look back. There will be a lot of flying glass.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'll try to dive behind one of the benches,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They probably won't be there.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SQUEAK?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Death of Rats had scurried up the side of the clock and was peering cheerfully over the top.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What do we do about <em class="calibre9">that</em>?” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">That </em>looks after itself,” said Susan. “I never worry about it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang nodded. “Take my hand,” he said. She reached out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">With his free hand Lobsang grasped the pendulum and stopped the clock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A blue-green hole opened in the world.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The return journey was a lot swifter but, when the world existed again, she was falling into water. It was brown, muddy and stank of dead plants. Susan surfaced, fighting against the drag of her skirts, and trod water while she tried to get her bearings.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sun was nailed to the sky, the air was heavy and humid, and a pair of nostrils was watching her from a few feet away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan had been brought up to be practical and that meant swimming lessons. The Quirm College for Young Ladies had been very advanced in that respect, and its teachers took the view that a girl who couldn't swim two lengths of the pool with her clothes on wasn't making an effort. To their credit, she'd left knowing four swimming strokes and several life-saving techniques, and was entirely at home in the water. She also knew what to do if you were sharing the same stretch of water with a hippopotamus, which was to find another stretch of water. Hippos only look big and cuddly from a distance. Close up, they just look big.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan summoned up all the inherited powers of the deathly voice plus the terrible authority of the schoolroom, and yelled, GO AWAY!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The creature floundered madly in its effort to turn round, and Susan struck out for the shore. It was an unsure shore, the water becoming land in a tangle of sandbanks, sucking black muck, rotted tree roots and swamp. Insects swirled around and—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–the cobbles were muddy underfoot, and there was the sound of horsemen in the mist</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–and ice, piled up against dead trees—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">–and Lobsang, taking her arm.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Found you,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You just shattered history,” said Susan. “You <em class="calibre9">broke </em>it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The hippo had come as a shock. She'd never realized one mouth could hold so much bad breath, or be so big and deep.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I know. I had to. There was no other way. Can you find Lu-Tze? I know Death can locate any living thing, and since you—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“All right, all right, I know,” said Susan darkly. She held out her hand and concentrated. An image of Lu-Tze's extremely heavy lifetimer appeared, and gathered weight.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's only a few hundred yards over there,” she said, pointing to a frozen drift.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And I know <em class="calibre9">when </em>he is,” said Lobsang. “Only sixty thousand years away. So…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze, when they found him, was looking calmly up at an enormous mammoth. Under its huge hairy brow its eyes were squinting with the effort both of seeing him and of getting all three of its brain cells lined up so that it could decide whether to trample on him or gouge him out of the frost-bound landscape. One brain cell was saying “gouge”, one was going for “trample” but the third had wandered off and was thinking about as much sex as possible.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the far end of its trunk, Lu-Tze was saying, “So, you've never <em class="calibre9">heard </em>of Rule One, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stepped out of the air beside him. “We must go, Sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The appearance of Lobsang did not seem to surprise Lu-Tze at all, although he did seem annoyed at the interruption.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No rush, wonder boy,” he said. “I've got this perfectly under control—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Where's the lady?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Over by that snowdrift,” said Lu-Tze, indicating with his thumb while still trying to outstare a pair of eyes five feet apart. “When this turned up she screamed and twisted her ankle. Look, you can see I've made it nervous—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan waded into the drift and hauled Unity upright. “Come on, we're leaving,” she said brusquely.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I saw his head cut off!” Unity babbled. “And then suddenly we were here!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that kind of thing happens,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Unity stared at her, wild-eyed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Life is full of surprises,” said Susan, but the sight of the creature's distress made her hesitate. All right, the thing was one of <em class="calibre9">them</em>, one that was merely wearing—Well, at least had started out merely wearing a body as a kind of coat, but now… After all, you could say that about <em class="calibre9">everyone</em>, couldn't you?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan had even wondered if the human soul without the anchor of a body would end up, eventually, as something like an Auditor. Which, to be fair, meant that Unity, who was getting more firmly wrapped in flesh by the minute, was something like a human. And that was a pretty good definition of Lobsang and, if it came to it, Susan as well. Who knew where humanity began and where it finished?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Come along,” she said. “We've got to stick together, right?”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Like shards of glass, spinning through the air, fragments of history drifted and collided and intersected in the dark.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a lighthouse, though. The valley of Oi Dong held on to the ever-repeating day. In the hall almost all of the giant cylinders stood silent, all time run out. Some had split. Some had melted. Some had exploded. Some had simply vanished. But one still turned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Big Thanda, the oldest and largest, ground slowly on its basalt bearing, winding time out at one end and back on the other, ensuring as Wen had decreed that the perfect day would never end.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rambut Handisides was all alone in the hall, sitting beside the turning stone in the light of a butter lamp and occasionally throwing a handful of grease onto the base.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A clink of stone made him peer into the darkness. It was heavy with the smoke of fried rock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There the sound was again and, then, the scratch and flare of a match.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze?” he said. “Is that you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I hope so, Rambut, but who knows, these days?” Lu-Tze stepped into the light and sat down. “Keeping you busy, are they?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Handisides sprang to his feet. “It's been terrible, Sweeper! Everyone's up in the Mandala Hall! It's worse than the Great Crash! There's bits of history everywhere and we've lost half the spinners! We'll never be able to put it all—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now, now, you look like a man who's had a busy day,” said Lu-Tze kindly. “Not got a lot of sleep, eh? Tell you what, I'll take care of this. You go and get a bit of shut-eye, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We thought you were lost out in the world, and—” the monk burbled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now I'm back,” smiled Lu-Tze, patting him on the shoulder. “There's still that little alcove round the corner where you repair the smaller spinners? And there's still those unofficial bunks for when it's the night shift and you only need a couple of lads to keep their eye on things?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Handisides nodded, and looked guilty. Lu-Tze wasn't supposed to know about the bunks.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You get along, then,” said Lu-Tze. He watched the man's retreating back and added, quietly, “and if you wake up you might turn out to be the luckiest idiot that ever there was. Well, wonder boy? What next?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We put everything back,” said Lobsang, emerging from the shadows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You know how long that took us last time?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” said Lobsang, looking around the stricken hall and heading towards the podium, “I do. I don't think it will take me as long.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wish you sounded more certain,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm… pretty certain,” said Lobsang, running his fingers over the bobbins on the board.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze waved a cautionary hand at Susan. Lobsang's mind was already on the way to somewhere else, and now she wondered how large a space it was occupying. His eyes were closed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The… spinners that axe left… Can you move the jumpers?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can show the ladies how to,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are there not monks who know how to do this?” said Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It would take too long. I am an apprentice to a sweeper. They would run around asking questions,” said Lobsang. “You will not.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's got a point right enough,” said Lu-Tze. “People will start saying ‘What is the meaning of this?’ and ‘Bikkit!’, and we'll never get anything done.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked down at the bobbins and then across at Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Imagine… that there is a jigsaw, all in pieces. But… I am very good at spotting edges and shapes. <em class="calibre9">Very </em>good. And all the pieces are moving. But because they were once linked, they have by their very nature a memory of that link. Their shape is the memory. Once a few are in the right position, the rest will be easier. Oh, and imagine that all the bits are scattered across the whole of eventuality, and mixing randomly with pieces from other histories. Can you grasp all that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I think so.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. Everything I have just said is nonsense. It bears no resemblance to the truth of the matter in any way at all. But it is a lie that you can… understand, I think. And then, afterwards—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You're going to go, aren't you,” said Susan. It was not a question.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I will not have enough power to stay,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You need power to stay human?” said Susan. She hadn't been aware of the rise of her heart, but now it was sinking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. Even trying to <em class="calibre9">think </em>in a mere four dimensions is a terrible effort. I'm sorry. Even to hold in my mind the concept of something called ‘now’ is hard. You thought I was mostly human. I'm mostly not.” He sighed. “If only I could tell you what everything looks like to me… it's so beautiful.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stared into the air above the little wooden bobbins. Things twinkled. There were complex curves and spirals, brilliant against the blackness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was like looking at a clock in pieces, with every wheel and spring carefully laid out in the dark in front of him. Dismantled, controllable, every part of it understood… but a number of small but important things had gone <em class="calibre9">ping </em>into the corners of a very large room. If you were really good, then you could work out where they'd landed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You've only got about a third of the spinners,” came the voice of Lu-Tze. “The rest are smashed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang couldn't see him. There was only the glittering show before his eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That… is true, but <em class="calibre9">once </em>they were whole,” he said. He raised his hands and lowered them onto the bobbins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan looked around at the sudden grinding noise and saw row after row of columns rising out of the dust and debris. They stood like lines of soldiers, rubble cascading from them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good trick!” Lu-Tze shouted to Susan's ear, above the thunder. “Feeding time into the spinners themselves! Theoretically possible, but we never managed to do it!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you know what he's actually going to <em class="calibre9">do</em>?” Susan shouted back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah! Snatch the extra time out of bits of history that are too far ahead and shove it into the bits that have fallen behind!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Sounds simple!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Just one problem!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Can't do it! Losses!” Lu-Tze snapped his fingers, trying to explain time dynamics to a non-initiate. “Friction! Divergence! All sorts of stuff! You can't <em class="calibre9">create </em>time on the spinners, you can only move it around—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a sudden bright blue glow around Lobsang. It flickered over the board, and then snapped across the air to form arcs of light leading to all the Procrastinators. It crawled between the carved symbols and clung to them in a thickening layer, like cotton winding on a reel.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze looked at the whirling light and the shadow within it, almost lost against the glow.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—at least,” he added, “until now.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spinners wound up to their working speed and then went faster, under the lash of the light. It poured across the cavern in a solid, unending stream.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Flames licked around the bottom of the nearest cylinder. The base was glowing, and the noise from its stone bearing was joining a rising, cavern-filling scream of stone in distress.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze shook his head. “You, Susan, buckets of water from the wells! You, Miss Unity, you follow her with the grease pails!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And what are you going to do?” said Susan, grabbing two buckets.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm going to worry like hell and that's not an easy job, believe me!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Steam built up then, and there was a smell of burning butter. There was no time for anything but to run from the wells to the nearest spitting bearing and back, and there was not enough time even for that.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spinners turned back and forth. There was no need for the jumpers now. The crystal rods that had survived the crash hung uselessly from their hooks as time arced overhead from one Procrastinator to another, showing up as red or blue glows in the air. It was a sight to frighten the <em class="calibre9">knoptas </em>off any trained spinnerdriver, Lu-Tze knew. It looked like a cascade running wild, but there was some control in there, some huge pattern being woven.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Bearings squealed. Butter bubbled. The bases of some spinners were smoking. But things held. They're <em class="calibre9">being </em>held, Lu-Tze thought. He looked up at the registers. The boards slammed back and forth, sending lines of red or blue or bare wood across the wall of the cavern. There was a pall of white smoke around them as their own wooden bearings gently charred.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Past and future were streaming through the air. The sweeper could feel them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">On the podium, Lobsang was wrapped in the glow. The bobbins were not being moved any more. What was going on now was on some other level, which didn't need the intervention of crude mechanisms.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Lion tamer</em>, Lu-Tze thought. He starts off needing chairs and whips but one day, if he's really good, he can go into the cage and do the show using nothing more than eye and voice. But only if he's really good, and you'll <em class="calibre9">know </em>if he's really good because he'll come out of the cage again—</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He stopped his prowl along the thundering lines because there was a change in the sound.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of the biggest spinners was slowing down. It stopped as Lu-Tze watched, and didn't start again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze raced around the cavern until he found Susan and Unity. Three more spinners stopped before he reached them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's doing it! He's doing it! Come away!” he shouted. With a jolt that shook the floor, another spinner stopped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The three ran towards the end of the cavern, where the smaller Procrastinators were still whirling, but the halt was already speeding down the rows. Spinner after spinner slammed to a standstill, the domino effect overtaking the humans until, when they reached the little chalk spinners, they were in time to see the last ones rattle gently to a halt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was silence, except for the sizzle of grease and the click of cooling rock.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Is it all over?” said Unity, wiping the sweat from her face with her dress and leaving a trail of sequins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze and Susan looked at the glow at the other end of the hall, and then at one another.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I… don't… think… so,” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze nodded. “I think it's just—” he began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Bars of green light leapt from spinner to spinner and hung in the air as rigid as steel. They flickered on and off between the columns, filling the air with thunderclaps. Patterns of switching snapped back and forth across the cavern.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The tempo increased. The thunderclaps became one long roll of overpowering sound. The bars brightened, expanded and then the air was all one brilliant light</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Which vanished. The sound ceased so abruptly that the silence clanged.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The trio got to their feet, slowly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What was <em class="calibre9">that</em>?” said Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I think he made some changes,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spinners were silent. The air was hot. Smoke and steam filled the roof of the cavern.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then, responding to the routine of humanity's eternal wrestle with time, the spinners began to pick up the load.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It came gently, like a breeze. And the spinners took the strain, from the smallest to the largest, settling once again into their gentle, ponderous pirouette.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Perfect,” said Lu-Tze. “Almost as good as it was, I'll bet.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Only almost?” said Susan, wiping the butter off her face.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, he's partly human,” said the sweeper. They turned to the podium, and it was empty. Susan was not surprised. He'd be weak now, of course. Of course, something like this would take it out of anyone. Of course, he'd need to rest. Of course.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He's gone,” she said flatly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who knows?” said Lu-Tze. “For is it not written, ‘You never know what's going to turn up’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The reassuring rumble of the Procrastinators now filled the cave. Lu-Tze could feel the time flows in the air. It was invigorating, like the smell of the sea. I ought to spend more time down here, he thought.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He broke history <em class="calibre9">and </em>repaired it,” said Susan. “Cause and cure. That makes no sense!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not in four dimensions,” said Unity. “In eighteen, it's all perfectly clear.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And now, may I suggest you ladies leave by the back way?” said Lu-Tze. “People are going to come running down here in a minute and it's all going to get very excitable. Probably best if you aren't around.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What will you do?” said Susan.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lie,” said Lu-Tze happily. “It's amazing how often that works.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">–ick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan and Unity stepped out of a door in the rock and took the path that led through rhododendron groves out of the valley. The sun was touching the horizon and the air was warm, although there were snowfields quite close by.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At the lip of the valley the water from the stream plunged over a cliff in a fall so long that it landed as a sort of rain. Susan pulled herself onto a rock, and settled down to wait.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is a long way to Ankh-Morpork,” said Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“We'll have a lift,” said Susan. The first stars were already coming out.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The stars are very pretty,” said Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do you <em class="calibre9">really </em>think so?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am learning to. Humans believe they are.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The thing is… I mean, there's times when you look at the universe and you think, ‘What about me?’ and you can just hear the universe replying, ‘Well, what about you?’”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Unity appeared to consider this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, what <em class="calibre9">about </em>you?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan sighed. “Exactly.” She sighed again. “You can't think about just one person while you're saving the world. You have to be a cold, calculating bastard.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That sounded as if you were quoting somebody,” said Unity. “Who said that?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Some total idiot,” said Susan. She tried to think of other things, and added, “We didn't get all of them. There's still Auditors down there somewhere.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That will not matter,” said Unity calmly. “Look at the sun.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is <em class="calibre9">setting</em>.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And…?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That means time is flowing through the world. The body exacts its toll Susan. Soon my—my former colleagues, bewildered and fleeing, will become tired. They will have to sleep.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I follow you, but—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am insane. I know this. But the first time it happened to me I found such horror that I cannot express it. Can you imagine what it is like? For an intellect a billion years old, in a body which is an ape on the back of a rat that grew out of a lizard? Can you imagine what comes out of the dark places, uncontrolled?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you telling me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They will die in their dreams.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan thought about this. Millions and millions of years of thinking precise, logical thoughts—and then humanity's murky past drops all its terrors on you in one go. She could almost feel sorry for them. Almost.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you didn't,” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. I think I must be… different. It is a terrible thing to be different, Susan. Did you have romantic hopes in connection with the boy?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The question came out of nowhere and there was no defence. Unity's face showed nothing but a kind of nervous concern.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No,” said Susan. Unfortunately, Unity did not seem to have mastered some of the subtleties of human conversation, such as when a tone of voice means “Stop this line of inquiry right now or may huge rats eat you by day and by night.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I confess to strange feelings regarding his… self that was the clockmaker. Sometimes, when he smiled, he was normal. I wanted to help him, because he seemed so closed in and sad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You don't have to <em class="calibre9">confess </em>to things like that,” Susan snapped. “How do you even know the word <em class="calibre9">romantic</em>, anyway?” she added.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I found some books of poetry.” Unity actually looked embarrassed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? I've never trusted it,” said Susan. Huge, giant, <em class="calibre9">hungry </em>rats.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I found it most curious. How can words on a page have a power like that? There is no doubt that being human is incredibly difficult and cannot be mastered in one lifetime,” said Unity sadly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan felt a stab of guilt. It wasn't Unity's fault, after all. People learn things as they grow up, things that never get written down. And Unity had never grown up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What are you going to do now?” she said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I do have a rather human ambition,” said Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, if I can help in any way…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was, she realized later, one of those phrases like “How are you?” People were supposed to understand that it wasn't a real question. But Unity hadn't learned that, either.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you. You can indeed help.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Uh, fine, if—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wish to die.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And, galloping out of the sunset, some riders were approaching.</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Small fires burned in the rubble, brightening the night. Most of the houses had been completely destroyed, although, Soto considered, the word “shredded” was much more accurate.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He was sitting by the side of the street, watching carefully, with his begging bowl in front of him. There were of course far more interesting and complex ways for a History Monk to avoid being noticed, but he'd adopted the begging bowl method ever since Lu-Tze had shown him that people never see anyone who wants them to give him money.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He'd watched the rescuers drag the bodies out of the house. Initially they'd thought that one of them had been hideously mutilated in the explosion, until it had sat up and explained that it was an Igor and in very good shape for an Igor, at that. The other he'd recognized as Dr Hopkins of the Guild of Clockmakers, who was miraculously unharmed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Soto did not believe in miracles, however. He was also suspicious about the fact that the ruined house was full of oranges, that Dr Hopkins was babbling about getting sunlight out of them, and that his sparkling little abacus was telling him that something enormous had happened.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He decided to make a report and see what the boys at Oi Dong said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Soto picked up the bowl and set off through the network of alleys back to his base. He didn't bother much about concealment now; Lu-Tze's time in the city had been a process of accelerated education for many citizens of the lurking variety. The people of Ankh-Morpork knew all about Rule One.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At least, they had known until now. Three figures lurched out of the dark, and one of them swung a heavy cleaver which would have connected with Soto's head if he hadn't ducked.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He was used to this sort of thing, of course. There was always the occasional slow learner, but they presented no peril that a neat slice couldn't handle.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He straightened up, ready to ease his way out of there, and a thick lock of black hair fell onto his shoulder, slithered down his robe and flopped onto the ground. It made barely a sound, but the expression on his face as Soto looked down and then up at his attackers made them draw back.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He could see, through the blood-red rage, that they all wore stained grey clothes and looked even crazier than the usual alley people; they looked like accountants gone mad.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">One of them reached out towards the begging bowl.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Everyone has a conditional clause in their life, some little unspoken addition to the rules like “except when I really need to” or “unless no one is looking” or, indeed, “unless the first one was nougat”. Soto had for centuries embraced a belief in the sanctity of all life and the ultimate uselessness of violence, but his personal conditional clause was “but not the hair. No one touches the hair, okay?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Even so, everyone ought to have a <em class="calibre9">chance</em>.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The attackers recoiled as he threw the bowl against the wall, where the hidden blades buried themselves in the woodwork.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then it began to tick.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Solo ran back down the alley, skidded round the corner and <em class="calibre9">then </em>shouted, “Duck!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately for the Auditors, alas, he was just a tiny, tiny fraction of a second too late—</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">Tick</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze was in his Garden of Five Surprises when the air sparkled and fragmented and swirled into a shape in front of him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He looked up from his ministrations to the yodelling stick insect, who'd been off its food.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang stood on the path. The boy was wearing a black robe dotted with stars, which blew and rattled its rags around him on this windless morning as if he was standing in the centre of a gale. Which, Lu-Tze supposed, he more or less was.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Back again, wonder boy?” said the sweeper.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In a way, I never leave,” said Lobsang. “Things have gone well with you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Don't you know?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I could. But part of me has to do this the traditional way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, the abbot is mighty suspicious and there's some amazing rumours flying around the place. I didn't say much. What do I know about anything? I'm just a sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">With that, Lu-Tze turned his attention to the sick insect. He'd counted to four under his breath before Lobsang said: “Please? I have to know. I believe that the fifth surprise is you. Am I right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze cocked his head. A low noise, which he'd heard for so long he no longer consciously heard it, had changed its tone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“The spinners are all winding out,” he said. “They know you're here, lad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I shall not be here long, Sweeper. Please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You just want to know my little surprise?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes. I know nearly everything else,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But you are Time. What I tell you in the future you'll know now, right?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I'm partly human. I want to <em class="calibre9">stay </em>partly human. That means doings things the right way round. Please?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze sighed and looked for a while down the avenue of cherry blossom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“When the pupil can beat the master, there is nothing the master cannot tell him,” he said. “Remember?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very well. The Iron Dojo should be free.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked surprised. “Uh, the Iron Dojo… Isn't that the one with all the sharp spikes in the walls?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And the ceiling, yes. The one that's like being inside a giant porcupine turned inside out.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked horrified. “But that's not for practice! The rules say—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's the one,” said Lu-Tze. “And <em class="calibre9">I </em>say we use it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good. No argument,” said Lu-Tze. “This way, lad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Blossom cascaded from the trees as they passed. They entered the monastery, and took the same route they'd taken once before. This brought them into the Hall of the Mandala, and the sand rose like a dog welcoming its master and spiralled in the air far below Lobsang's sandals. Lu-Tze heard the shouts of the attendants behind him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">News like this spread throughout the valley like ink in water. Hundreds of monks, apprentices and sweepers were trailing the pair as they crossed the inner courtyards, like the tail of a comet.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Above them, all the time, petals of cherry blossom fell like snow. At last Lu-Tze reached the high, round metal door of the Iron Dojo. The clasp of the door was fifteen feet up. No one who did not belong there was supposed to open the door of the dojo.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper nodded at his former apprentice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You do it,” he said. “I can't.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang glanced at him, and then looked up at the high clasp. Then he pressed a hand against the iron.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Rust spread under his fingers. Red stains spread out across the ancient metal. The door began to creak, and then to crumble. Lu-Tze prodded it with an experimental finger, and a slab of biscuit-strong metal fell out and collapsed on the flagstones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very impress—” he began. A squeaky rubber elephant bounced off his head.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bikkit!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The crowd parted. The chief acolyte ran forward, carrying the abbot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What is the <em class="calibre9">wanna bikkit BIKKIT </em>meaning of this? Who is <em class="calibre9">wozza funny man </em>this person, Sweeper? The spinners are dancing in their hall!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“He is Time, Reverend One, as you have suspected,” he said. Still bent in the bow, he looked up and sideways at Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bow!” he hissed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang looked puzzled. “<em class="calibre9">I </em>should bow even now?” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Bow, you little <em class="calibre9">stonga</em>, or I shall teach you such discipline! Show deserved respect! You are <em class="calibre9">still </em>my apprentice until I give you leave!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Shocked, Lobsang bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And why do you visit us in our timeless valley?” said the abbot. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Tell the abbot!” Lu-Tze snapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I… I wish to learn the Fifth Surprise,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—Reverend One—” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“—Reverend One,” Lobsang finished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You visit us just to learn of our clever sweeper's fancies?” said the abbot.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, er, Reverend One.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of all the things Time could be doing, you wish to see an old man's trick? <em class="calibre9">Bikkit</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Reverend One.” The monks stared at Lobsang. His robe still fluttered this way and that in the teeth of the intangible gale, the stars glinting when they caught the light.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The abbot smiled a cherubic smile. “So should we all,” he said. “None of us has ever seen it, I believe. None of us has ever been able to wheedle it out of him. But… this is the Iron Dojo. It has rules! Two may walk in, but only one can walk out! This is no practice dojo! <em class="calibre9">Wanna 'lephant</em>! Do you understand?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I don't want—” Lobsang began, and the sweeper jerked an elbow into his ribs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You say ‘Yes, Reverend One,’” he growled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I never intended—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This time the back of his head was slapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“This is no time to step back!” Lu-Tze said. “You're too late, wonder boy!” He nodded to the abbot. “My apprentice understands, Reverend One.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Your <em class="calibre9">apprentice</em>, Sweeper?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes, Reverend One,” said Lu-Tze. “My apprentice. Until I say otherwise.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really? <em class="calibre9">Bikkit</em>! Then he may enter. You too, Lu-Tze.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I only meant to—” Lobsang protested.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Inside!” Lu-Tze roared. “Will you shame me? Shall people think I have taught you nothing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The inside of the Iron Dojo was, indeed, a darkened dome full of spikes. They were needle thin and there were tens of thousands of them covering the nightmare walls.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Who would build something like this?” said Lobsang, looking up at the glistening points that covered even the ceiling.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It teaches the virtues of stealth and discipline,” said Lu-Tze, cracking his knuckles. “Impetuosity and speed can be as dangerous to the attacker as to the attacked, as perhaps you will learn. One condition: we are all human here? Agreed?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Of course, Sweeper. We are all human here.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And shall we agree: no tricks?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No tricks,” said Lobsang. “But—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Are we fighting, or are we talking?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But, look, if only one can walk out, that means I'll have to kill you—” Lobsang began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Or vice versa, of course,” said Lu-Tze. “That is the rule, yes. Shall we get on?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But I didn't know that!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In life, as in breakfast cereal, it is always best to read the instructions on the box,” said Lu-Tze. “This is the Iron Dojo, wonder boy!” He stepped back and bowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang shrugged, and bowed in return.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze took a few steps back. He closed his eyes for a moment, and then went through a series of simple moves, limbering up. Lobsang winced to hear the crackle of joints.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Around Lobsang there was a series of snapping noises, and for a moment he thought of the old sweeper's bones. But tiny hatches all over the curved wall were swinging open. He could hear whispers as people jostled for position. And by the sound of it, there were a great many people.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He extended his hands, and let himself rise gently in the air. </div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thought we said no tricks?” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper,” said Lobsang, poised in mid-air. “And then <em class="calibre9">I </em>thought: never forget Rule One.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Aha! Well done. You've learned something!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang drifted closer. “You cannot believe the things that I have seen since last I saw you,” he said. “Words cannot describe them. I have seen worlds nesting within worlds, like those dolls they carve in Uberwald. I have heard the music of the years. I know more than I can ever understand. But I do not know the Fifth Surprise. It is a trick, a conundrum… a test.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Everything is a test,” said Lu-Tze.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Then show me the Fifth Surprise and I promise not to harm you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You promise not to harm me?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I promise not to harm you,” Lobsang repeated solemnly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Fine. You only had to ask,” said Lu-Tze, smiling broadly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? I asked before and you refused!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You only had to ask at the right time, wonder boy.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“And is it the right time now?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It is written, ‘There's no time like the present,’” said Lu-Tze. “Behold, the Fifth Surprise!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached into his robe.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang floated closer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The sweeper produced a cheap carnival mask. It was one of those that consisted of a fake pair of spectacles, glued above a big pink nose, and finished with a heavy black moustache.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He put it on and waggled his ears once or twice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Boo,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?” said Lobsang, bewildered.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Boo,” Lu-Tze repeated. “I never said it was a particularly <em class="calibre9">imaginative </em>surprise, did I?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He waggled his ears again, and then waggled his eyebrows.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Good, eh?” he said, and grinned.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang laughed. Lu-Tze grinned wider. Lobsang laughed louder, and lowered himself to the mat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The blows came out of nowhere. They caught him in the stomach, on the back of his neck, in the small of his back and swept his legs from under him. He landed on his stomach, with Lu-Tze pinning him down in the Straddle of the Fish. The only way to get out of that was to dislocate your own shoulders.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a sort of collective sigh from the hidden watchers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">Deja-fu</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What?” said Lobsang, into the mat. “You said none of the monks knew <em class="calibre9">deja-fu</em>!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I never taught it to 'em, that's why!” said Lu-Tze. “Promise not to harm me, would you? Thank you so very much! Submit?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You never told me <em class="calibre9">you </em>knew it!” Lu-Tze's knees, rammed into the secret pressure points, were turning Lobsang's arms into powerless lumps of flesh.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I may be old but I'm not daft!” Lu-Tze shouted. “You don't think I'd give away a trick like <em class="calibre9">that</em>, do you?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“That's not fair—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze leaned down until his mouth was an inch from Lobsang's ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Didn't say ‘fair’ on the box, lad. But you can win, you know. You could turn me into dust, just like that. How could I stop Time?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I can't do that!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“You mean you won't, and we both know it. Submit?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang could feel parts of his body trying to shut themselves down. His shoulders were on fire. I can discarnate, he thought. Yes, I can, I could turn him to dust with a thought. And lose. I'd walk out and he'd be dead and I'd have lost.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nothing to worry about, lad,” said Lu-Tze, calmly now. “You just forgot Rule Nineteen. Submit?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Rule <em class="calibre9">Nineteen</em>?” said Lobsang, almost pushing himself off the mat until terrible pain forced him down again. “What the hell is Rule Nineteen? Yes, yes, submit, submit!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“‘Remember Never to Forget Rule One’,” said Lu-Tze. He released his grip. “And always ask yourself: how come it was created in the first place, eh?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze got to his feet, and went on: “But you have performed well, all things considered, and therefore as your master I have no hesitation in recommending you for the yellow robe. Besides,” he lowered his voice to a whisper, “everyone peeking in here has seen me beat Time and that's the sort of thing that'll look really good on my curriculum vitae, if you catch my meaning. Def'nitely give the o'l Rule One a fillip. Let me give you a hand up.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reached down.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang was about to take the hand when he hesitated. Lu-Tze grinned again, and gently pulled him upright.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But only one of us can leave, Sweeper,” said Lobsang, rubbing his shoulders.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said Lu-Tze. “But playing the game changes the rules. I say the hell with it.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The remains of the door were pushed aside by the hands of many monks. There was the sound of someone being hit with a rubber yak. “<em class="calibre9">Bikkit!</em>”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“…and the abbot, I believe, is ready to present you with the robe,” said Lu-Tze. “Don't make any comment if he dribbles on it, please.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They left the dojo and, followed now by every soul in Oi Dong, headed for the long terrace.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was, Lu-Tze reminisced later, an unusual ceremony. The abbot did not appear overawed, because babies generally aren't and will throw up over <em class="calibre9">anyone</em>. Besides, Lobsang might have been master of the gulfs of time, but the abbot was master of the valley, and therefore respect was a line that travelled in both directions.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">But the handing over of the robe had caused a difficult moment.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang had refused it. It had been left to the chief acolyte to ask why, while the whispered current of surprise washed through the crowd.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I am not worthy, sir.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze has declared that you have completed your apprenticeship, my lo—Lobsang Ludd.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang bowed. “Then I will take the broom and the robe of a sweeper, sir.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">This time the current was a tsunami. It crashed over the audience. Heads turned. There were gasps of shock, and one or two nervous laughs. And, from the lines of sweepers who had been allowed to pause in their tasks to watch the event, there was a watchful, intent silence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The chief acolyte licked his suddenly dehydrated lips.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… but… you are the incarnation of Time…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In this valley, sir,” said Lobsang firmly, “I am as worthy as a sweeper.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The chief acolyte looked around, but there was no help anywhere. The other senior members of the monastery had no wish to share in the huge pink cloud of embarrassment. The abbot merely blew bubbles, and grinned the inward knowing grin of all babies everywhere.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Do we have any… uh… do we present sweepers with… do we by any chance…?” the acolyte mumbled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze stepped up behind him. “Can I be of any help, your acolytility?” he said, with a sort of mad keen subservience that was quite alien to his normal attitude.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze? Ah…er…yes…er…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I could fetch a nearly new robe, sir, and the lad can have my old broom if you'll sign a chitty for me to get a new one from stores, sir,” said Lu-Tze, sweating helpfulness at every pore.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The chief acolyte, drowning well out of his depth, seized on this like a passing lifebelt.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, would you be so good, Lu-Tze? It is so kind of you…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze vanished in a blur of helpful speed that, once again, quite surprised those who thought they knew him.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He reappeared with his broom and a robe made white and thin with frequent bashings on the stones by the river. He solemnly handed them over to the chief acolyte.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, uh, thank you, er, is there a special ceremony for the, for the, er, for… er…” the man burbled.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very simple one, sir,” said Lu-Tze, still radiating eagerness. “Wording is quite loose, sir, but generally we say, ‘This is your robe, look after it, it belongs to the monastery,’ sir, and then with the broom we say something like ‘Here's your broom, treat it well, it is your friend, you will be fined if you lose it, remember they do not grow on trees,’ sir.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Er, um, uh,” the chief acolyte murmured. “And does the abbot—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh no, the abbot would not make a presentation to a sweeper,” said Lobsang quickly.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Lu-Tze, who does the, er, does, uh, does the…”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's generally done by a senior sweeper, your acolytility.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh? And, er, by some happy chance, er, do <em class="calibre9">you </em>happen to be—?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze bobbed a bow. “Oh, <em class="calibre9">yes</em>, sir.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To the chief acolyte, still floundering in the flood of the turning tide, this was as welcome as the imminent prospect of dry land. He beamed manically.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, then, if you would be so kind, er, then, er, to—”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Happy to, sir.” Lu-Tze swung round. “Right now, sir?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, please, yes!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right you are. Step forward, Lobsang Ludd!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Sweeper!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze held out the worn robe and the elderly broom. “Broom! Robe! Do not lose them, we are not made of money!” he announced.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I thank you for them,” said Lobsang. “I am honoured.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang bowed. Lu-Tze bowed. With their heads close together and at the same height, Lu-Tze hissed, “Very surprising.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Thank you.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nicely mythic, the whole thing, definitely one for the scrolls, but bordering on smug. Do not try it again.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Right.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They both stood up. “And, er, what happens now?” said the chief acolyte. He was a broken man, and he knew it. Nothing was going to be the same after this.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Nothing, really,” said Lu-Tze. “Sweepers get on with sweeping. You take that side, lad, and I'll take this.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But he is Time!” said the chief acolyte. “The son of Wen! There is so much we have to ask!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“There is so much I will not tell,” said Lobsang, smiling. The abbot leaned forward and dribbled into the chief acolyte's ear.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">He gave up. “Of course, it is not up to us to question you,” he said, backing away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No,” said Lobsang. “It is not. I suggest you all get on with your very important work, because this plaza is going to need all my attention.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There were frantic hand signals amongst the senior monks and, gradually, reluctantly, the monastery staff moved away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“They'll be watching us from every place they can hide,” mumbled Lu-Tze, when the sweepers were alone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh, yes,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“So, how are you, then?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Very well. And my mother is happy, and she will retire with my father.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What? A cottage in the country, that sort of thing?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Not quite. Similar, though.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was no sound for a while but the brushing of two brooms. Then Lobsang said, “I'm aware, Lu-Tze, that it is usual for an apprentice to give a small gift or token to his master when he finishes his apprenticeship.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Possibly,” said Lu-Tze, straightening up. “But I don't need anything. I've got my mat, my bowl and my Way.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Every man has something he desires,” said Lobsang.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah! Got you there, then, wonder boy. I'm eight hundred years old. I've run through all my desires long ago.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh dear. That is a shame. I hoped I could find <em class="calibre9">something</em>.” Now Lobsang straightened up and swung his broom onto his shoulder.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In any case, I must leave,” he said. “There is so much still to do.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“I'm sure there is,” said Lu-Tze. “I'm sure there is. There's the whole stretch under the trees, for one thing. And while we're on the subject, wonder boy, did you let that witch have her broomstick back?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang nodded. “Let us just say… I put things back. It's a lot newer than it was, too.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Hah!” said Lu-Tze, sweeping up a few more petals. “Just like that. Just like that. So easily does a thief of time repay his debts!”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang must have caught the rebuke in the tone. He stared down at his feet. “Well, perhaps not <em class="calibre9">all </em>of them, I admit,” he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Oh?” said Lu-Tze, still apparently fascinated by the end of his own broom.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But when you have to save a world you cannot think of one person, you see, because one person is a part of that world,” Lobsang went on.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Really?” said the sweeper. “You think so? You've been talking to some very strange people, my lad.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But now I have time,” said Lobsang earnestly. “And I hope she'll understand.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's amazing what a lady will understand, if you find the right way of putting it,” said Lu-Tze. “Best of luck, lad. You didn't do so bad, on the whole. And is it not written, ‘There's no time like the present’?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lobsang smiled at him, and vanished.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Lu-Tze went back to his sweeping. After a while, he smiled at a memory. An apprentice gives a gift to the master, eh? As if Lu-Tze could want anything that Time could give him…</div>
      <div class="paragraph">And he stopped, and looked up, and laughed out loud. Overhead, swelling as he watched, the cherries were ripening.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">In some place that had not existed before, and only existed now for this very purpose, stood a large, gleaming vat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ten thousand gallons of delicate fondant sugar cream infused with essence of violet and stirred into dark chocolate,” said Chaos. “There are also strata of hazelnut praline in rich butter cream, and areas of soft caramel for that special touch of delight.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">SO… YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS VAT COULD EXIST SOMEWHERE IN A TRULY INFINITE EVERYWHERE AND THEREFORE IT CAN EXIST HERE? said Death.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed,” said Chaos.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">BUT IT NO LONGER EXISTS IN THE PLACE WHERE IT SHOULD EXIST.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“No. It should, <em class="calibre9">now</em>, exist here. The maths is easy,” said Chaos.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">AH? WELL, MATHS, said Death dismissively. GENERALLY I NEVER GET MUCH FURTHER THAN SUBTRACTION.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“In any case, chocolate is hardly a rare commodity,” said Chaos. “There are planets covered in the stuff.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">REALLY?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Indeed.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">IT MIGHT BE BEST, said Death, IF NEWS LIKE THAT DID NOT GET ABOUT. He walked back to where Unity was waiting in the darkness.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS, he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“What else is there?” said Unity. “I have betrayed my own kind. And I am hideously insane. I can never be at home anywhere. And staying here would be an agony.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She stared into the chocolate abyss. A dusting of sugar sparkled on its surface.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she slipped out of her dress. To her amazement she felt embarrassed about doing so, but still drew herself up haughtily.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Spoon,” she commanded, and held out her right hand imperiously. Chaos gave a silver ladle a final, theatrical polish and passed it to her.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Goodbye,” said Unity. “Do pass on my best wishes to your granddaughter.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She walked a few steps back, turned, broke into a run, and took off into a perfect swallow dive.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The chocolate closed over her with barely a sound. Then the two watchers waited until the fat, lazy ripples had died away.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Now there was a lady with <em class="calibre9">style</em>,” said Chaos. “What a waste.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES. I THOUGHT SO.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Well, it's been fun… up to that point, anyway. And now I must be off,” said Chaos.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YOU'RE CONTINUING WITH THE MILK ROUND?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“People rely on me.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Death looked impressed. IT'S GOING TO BE… INTERESTING TO HAVE YOU BACK, he said.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Yeah. It is,” said Chaos. “You're not coming?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">I'M JUST GOING TO WAIT HERE FOR A WHILE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">JUST IN CASE.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ah.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">It was some minutes later that Death reached into his robe and pulled out a lifetimer that was small and light enough to have been designed for a doll. He turned round.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“But… I <em class="calibre9">died</em>,” said the shade of Unity.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">YES, said Death. THIS IS THE NEXT PART…</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Emma Robertson sat in the classroom with wrinkled brow, chewing on her pencil. Then, rather slowly, but with the air of one imparting great secrets, she set to work.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She wrote:</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“<em class="calibre9">We went to Lanker where there are witches they are kind they grow erbs. We met this which she was very jole and sang us a snog abot a hedghog it had dificut words. Jason try to kick her cat it chase him up a tre. I know a lot about wiches now they do not have warts they do not eat you they are just like your grane except your grane does not know difult words</em>.”</div>
      <br class="calibre8"/>
      <div class="paragraph">At her high desk Susan relaxed. There was nothing like a classroom of bent heads. A good teacher used whatever materials there were to hand, and taking the class to visit Mrs Ogg was an education in herself. Two educations.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A classroom going well had its own smell: a hint of pencil shavings, poster paints, long-dead stick insect, glue, and, of course, the faint aroma of Billy.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There had been an uneasy meeting with her grandfather. She'd raged that he hadn't told her things. And he'd said, of course he hadn't. If you told humans what the future held, it wouldn't. That made sense. Of course it made sense. It was good logic. The trouble was that Susan was only <em class="calibre9">mostly </em>logical. And so, now, things were back in that uneasy, rather cool state where they spent most of their time, in the tiny little family that <em class="calibre9">ran </em>on dysfunctionality.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Maybe, she thought, that was a normal family state in any case. When push came to shove—thank you, Mrs Ogg, she'd always remember that phrase now—they'd rely on each other automatically, without a thought. Apart from that, they kept out of one another's way.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">She hadn't seen the Death of Rats lately. It was too much to hope that he was dead. In any case, it hadn't slowed him down so far.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">That thought made her think about the contents of her desk. Susan was very strict about eating in class and took the view that, if there were rules, then they applied to everyone, even her. Otherwise they were merely tyranny. But rules were there to make you think before you broke them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">There was still half a box of Higgs &amp; Meakins' cheapest assortment tucked in there amongst the books and papers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Opening the lid carefully and slipping her hand in was easy, and so was the maintenance of a suitably teachery face while she did so. Questing fingers found a chocolate in the nest of empty paper cups, and told her that it was a damn nougat. But she was resolute. Life was tough. Sometimes you got nougat.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Then she briskly picked up the keys and walked to the Stationery Cupboard with what she hoped was the purposeful step of someone about to check on the supply of pencils. After all, you never knew, with pencils. They needed watching.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The door clicked behind her, leaving only the dim light through the transom. She put the chocolate in her mouth and shut her eyes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A faint, cardboardy sound made her open them. The lids were gently lifting on the boxes of stars.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">They spilled out and whirled up into the shadows of the cupboard, brilliant against the darkness, a galaxy in miniature, gently spinning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Susan watched them for a while, and then said, “All right, you have my full attention, whoever you are.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At least, that was what she meant to say. The peculiar stickiness of the nougat caused it to come out as: “Allite, you ot my fo' a'nen'on, oover ooah.” Damn!</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The stars spiralled around her head, and the cupboard's interior darkened into interstellar black.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“If iss is oo, Def o' Raffs—” she began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“It's me,” said Lobsang.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">4. An edge witch is one who makes her living on the edges, in that moment when boundary conditions apply—between life and death, light and dark, good and evil and, most dangerously of all, today and tomorrow.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">5. But they still use forks, or, at least, the <em class="calibre9">idea </em>of forks. There may, as the philosopher says, be no spoon, although this begs the question of why there is the idea of soup.</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402102" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF6"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">6. And the story continues: The novice who had protested that it was only the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple, the student who said nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life; and the student who had seen the inevitable shape of the story went, after much agonizing and several months of meticulous sweeping, to Lu-Tze and knelt and asked to be shown the Right Way. Whereupon the Sweeper took him to the dojo of the Tenth Djim, with its terrible multi-bladed fighting machines and its fearsome serrated weapons such as the <em class="calibre9">clong-clong </em>and the <em class="calibre9">uppsi</em>. The story runs that the Sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo and produced a broom and spake thusly: “One hand <em class="calibre9">here </em>and the other <em class="calibre9">here</em>, understand? People never get it right. Use good, even strokes and let the broom do most of the work. Never try to sweep up a big pile, you'll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice. Use your dustpan wisely, and remember: a small brush for the corners.”</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402135" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF7"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">7. One reason for this was the club food. At his club, a gentleman could find the kind of food he'd got used to at school, like spotted dick, jam roly-poly and that perennial favourite, stodge and custard. Vitamins are eaten by wives.</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402144" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF8"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">8. Which is much harder than seeing things that <em class="calibre9">aren't </em>there. <em class="calibre9">Everyone </em>does that.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">9. This is true. A chocolate you did not want to eat does not count as chocolate. This discovery is from the same branch of culinary physics that determined that food eaten while walking contains no calories.</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402170" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF10"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">10. Not “Did” anything, just “Did”. Some things were Done, and some things were Not Done. And the things that were Done, Igors Did.</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402180" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF11"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">11. Igors were loyal, but they were not stupid. A job was a job. When an employer had no further use for your services, for example because he'd just been staked through the heart by a crowd of angry villagers, it was time to move on before they decided that you ought to be on the next stake. An Igor soon learned a secret way out of any castle and where to stash an overnight bag. In the words of one of the founding Igors: “<em class="calibre9">We </em>belong dead? Excuthe me? Where doeth it thay ‘we’?”</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402200" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF12"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">12. And it has to be said that there was nothing intrinsically evil about Igors themselves. They just didn't pass judgement on other people. Admittedly, that was because if you worked for werewolves and vampires and people who looked on surgery as modern art rather than science, passing judgement would mean you'd never have time to get anything <em class="calibre9">done</em>.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">13. Every society needs a cry like that, but only in a very few do they come out with the complete, unvarnished version, which is “Remember-the-Atrocity-Committed-Against-Us-Last-Time-That-Will-Excuse-the-Atrocity-That-We're-About-to-Commit-Today! And So On! Hurrah!”</div>
    
    <div id="TOC_id36402229" class="calibre8"><a id="TOT_APF14"></a></div>
      <div class="paragraph">14. The yeti of the Ramtops, where the Discworld's magical field is so intense that it is part of the very landscape, are one of the few creatures to utilize control of personal time for genetic advantage. The result is a kind of physical premonition—you find out what is going to happen next by allowing it to happen. Faced with danger, or any kind of task that involves risk of death, a yeti will <em class="calibre9">save </em>its life up to that point and then proceed with all due caution, yet in the comfortable knowledge that should everything go pancake-shaped, it will wake up at the point where it saved itself with, and this is the important part, <em class="calibre9">knowledge of the events which have just happened but which will not now happen because it's not going to be such a damn fool next time</em>. This is not quite the paradox it appears because, after it has taken place, it hasn't happened. All that actually remains is a memory in the yeti's head, which merely turns out to be a remarkably accurate premonition. The little eddies in time caused by all this are just lost in the noise of all the kinks, dips and knots put in time by every other living creature.</div>

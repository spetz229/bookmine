    A book with the size and scope of this one cannot be done by two mere authors alone. It requires the effort of many very smart people with superhuman eyes spotting as many mistakes as possible and providing valuable insights into the details of these technologies.

    From Eric: Dear Noelle, you’re not special; you’re unique, and that’s so much better. Thanks for living through another book. Thanks also to the database creators and commiters for providing us something to write about and make a living at.

    From Jim: First, I have to thank my family; Ruthy, your boundless patience and encouragement have been heartwarming.  Emma and Jimmy, you’re two smart cookies, and your daddy loves you always.  Also a special thanks to all the unsung heroes who monitor IRC, message boards, mailing lists, and bug systems ready to help anyone who needs you.  Your dedication to open source keeps these projects kicking.

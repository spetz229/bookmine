  PostgreSQL is the hammer of the database world. It’s commonly understood, is often readily available, is sturdy, and solves a surprising number of problems if you swing hard enough. No one can hope to be an expert builder without understanding this most common of tools.

  PostgreSQL is a relational database management system, which means it’s a set-theory-based system, implemented as two-dimensional tables with data rows and strictly enforced column types. Despite the growing interest in newer database trends, the relational style remains the most popular and probably will for quite some time.

  The prevalence of relational databases comes not only from their vast toolkits (triggers, stored procedures, advanced indexes), their data safety (via <span class="initials">ACID</span> compliance), or their mind share (many programmers speak and think relationally) but also from their query pliancy. Unlike some other datastores, you needn’t know how you plan to use the data. If a relational schema is normalized, queries are flexible. PostgreSQL is the finest open source example of the relational database management system (<span class="initials">RDBMS</span>) tradition.

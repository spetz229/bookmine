      This book contains code in a variety of languages. In part, this is a consequence of the databases that we cover.  We’ve attempted to limit our choice of languages to Ruby/JRuby and JavaScript. We prefer command-line tools to scripts, but we will introduce other languages to get the job done—like PL/pgSQL (Postgres) and Gremlin/Groovy (Neo4J). We’ll also explore writing some server-side JavaScript applications with Node.js. 
    </p>
<p id="N10160" class="calibre5">
      Except where noted, code listings are provided in full, usually ready to be executed at your leisure.  Samples and snippets are syntax highlighted according to the rules of the language involved.  Shell commands are prefixed by <code class="cf">$</code>.</p>

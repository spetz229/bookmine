<h2 id="N13BEB" class="calibre18">4.1 Introducing HBase</h2>
<p id="N13BEF" class="calibre5">
   HBase is a <span class="calibre6">column-oriented</span> database that prides itself on consistency and scaling out.  It is based on BigTable, a high-performance, proprietary database developed by Google and described in the 2006 white paper  “Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data.”<a id="FNPTR-26" href="f_0033.html#FOOTNOTE-26">[26]</a>  Initially created for natural-language processing, HBase started life as a contrib package for Apache Hadoop.  Since then, it has become a top-level Apache project.
    </p>
<p id="N13C0A" class="calibre5">
On the architecture front, HBase is designed to be fault tolerant.  Hardware failures may be uncommon for individual machines, but in a large cluster, node failure is the norm.  By using write-ahead logging and distributed configuration, HBase can quickly recover from individual server failures. 
  </p>
<p id="N13C10" class="calibre5">
Additionally, HBase lives in an ecosystem that has its own complementary benefits.  HBase is built on Hadoop—a sturdy, scalable computing platform that provides a distributed file system and mapreduce capabilities.  Wherever you find HBase, you’ll find Hadoop and other infrastructural components that you can lever in your own applications.
  </p>
<p id="N13C13" class="calibre5">
It is actively used and developed by a number of high-profile companies for their “Big Data” problems.  Notably, Facebook chose HBase as a principal component of its new messaging infrastructure announced in November 2010.  Stumbleupon has been using HBase for real-time data storage and analytics for several years, serving various site features directly from HBase.  Twitter uses HBase extensively, ranging from data generation (for applications such as people search) to storing monitoring/performance data.  The parade of companies using HBase also includes the likes of eBay, Meetup, Ning, Yahoo!, and many others.
    </p>
<p id="N13C16" class="calibre5">
With all of this activity, new versions of HBase are coming out at a fairly rapid clip.  At the time of this writing, the current stable version is 0.90.3, so that’s what we’ll be using.  Go ahead and download HBase, and we’ll get started.

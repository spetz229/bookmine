<p id="N197A4" class="calibre5">
      It can be a bit difficult to classify exactly what Redis <span class="calibre6">is</span>. At a basic level, it’s a key-value store, of course, but that simple label doesn’t really do it justice. Redis supports advanced data structures, though not to the degree that a document-oriented database would.  It supports set-based query operations but not with the granularity or type support you’d find in a relational database. And, of course, it’s <span class="calibre6">fast</span>, trading durability for raw speed.
    </p>
<p id="N197B8" class="calibre5">
      In addition to being an advanced data structure server, Redis is a blocking queue (or stack) and a publish-subscribe system. It features configurable expiry policies, durability levels, and replication options. All of this makes Redis more of a toolkit of useful data structure algorithms and processes than a member of any specific database genre.
    </p>
<p id="N197BB" class="calibre5">
    Redis’ expansive list of client libraries makes it a drop-in option for many programming languages. It’s not simply easy to use; it’s a joy. If an API is UX for programmers, then Redis should be in the Museum of Modern Art alongside the Mac Cube.
    </p>
<p id="N197BE" class="calibre5">
      In Days 1 and 2 we’ll explore Redis’s features, conventions, and configuration. Starting with simple CRUD operations like always, we’ll quickly move on to more advanced operations involving more powerful data structures: lists, hashes, sets, and sorted sets. We’ll create transactions and manipulate data expiry characteristics.  We’ll use Redis to create a simple message queue and explore its publish-subscribe functionality.  Then we’ll dive into Redis’s configuration and replication options, learning how to strike an application-appropriate balance between data durability and speed.
    </p>

      Databases are often and increasingly used in concert with each other. Redis is introduced last in this book so that we can use it in just such a manner.  In Day 3, we’ll build our capstone system, a rich multidatabase music solution including Redis, CouchDB, Neo4J, and Postgres—using Node.js to cement it together.

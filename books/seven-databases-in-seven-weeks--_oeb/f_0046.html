    A bungee cord may not seem a standard carpentry tool, just like Neo4j may not seem like a standard database. Bungee cord is used to tie things together—no matter how awkwardly shaped the objects may be. If your ability to tie a table to a column to a pickup truck in the most organic way is of the utmost importance, this is your go-to tool.

    Neo4j is a new type of NoSQL datastore called a <span class="calibre6">graph database</span>. As the name implies, it stores data as a graph (in the mathematical sense). It’s known for being “whiteboard friendly,” meaning if you can draw a design as boxes and lines on a whiteboard, you can store it in Neo4j. Neo4j focuses more on the <span class="calibre6">relationships between</span> values than on the commonalities <span class="calibre6">among sets of</span> values (such as collections of documents or tables of rows). In this way, it can store highly variable data in a natural and straightforward way.

    Neo4j is small enough to be embedded into nearly any application. On the other end of the spectrum, Neo4j can store tens of billions of nodes and as many edges. And with its cluster support with master-slave replication across many servers, it can handle most any sized problem you can throw at it.

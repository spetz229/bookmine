    MongoDB is in many ways like a power drill. Your ability to complete a task is framed largely by the components you choose to use (from drill bits of varying size to sander adapters). MongoDB’s strength lies in versatility, power, ease of use, and ability to handle jobs both large and small. Although it’s a much newer invention than the hammer, it is increasingly a tool builders reach for quite often.

  First publicly released in 2009, MongoDB is a rising star in the NoSQL world. It was designed as a scalable database—the name Mongo comes from “hu<span class="calibre6">mongo</span>us”—with performance and easy data access as core design goals. It is a document database, which allows data to persist in a nested state, and importantly, it can query that nested data in an ad hoc fashion. It enforces no schema (similar to Riak but unlike Postgres), so documents can optionally contain fields or types that no other document in the collection contains.

  But don’t think that MongoDB’s flexibility makes it a toy. There are some huge production MongoDB (often just called <span class="calibre6">Mongo</span>) deployments out there, like Foursquare, bit.ly, and CERN, for collecting Large Hadron Collider data.

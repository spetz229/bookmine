<p id="N124E9" class="calibre5">
  Riak speaks <span class="calibre6">web</span> better than any other database we’ll see in this book (though CouchDB is a close second). You query via URLs, headers, and verbs, and Riak returns assets and standard HTTP response codes.

      Since the goal of this book is to investigate seven databases and their concepts, and not teach new programming languages, we try to avoid introducing new languages where possible. Riak supplies an HTTP REST interface, so we’re going to interact with it via the URL tool cURL. In production, you’ll almost always use a driver in your language of choice. Using cURL allows us to peek at the underlying API without resorting to a particular driver or programming language.

    Riak is a great choice for datacenters like Amazon that must serve many requests with low latency. If every millisecond spent waiting is a potential customer loss, Riak is hard to beat. It’s easy to manage, easy to set up, and can grow with your needs.  If you’ve ever used Amazon Web Services, like SimpleDB or S3, you may notice some similarities in form and function. This is no coincidence. Riak is inspired by Amazon’s Dynamo paper.<a id="FNPTR-9" href="f_0027.html#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a>

    In this chapter, we’ll investigate how Riak stores and retrieves values and how to tie data together using <code class="cf">Link</code>s. Then we’ll explore a data-retrieval concept used heavily throughout this book: mapreduce. We’ll see how Riak clusters its servers and handles requests, even in the face of server failure. Finally, we’ll look at how Riak resolves conflict that arises from writing to distributed servers, and we’ll look at some extensions to the basic server.

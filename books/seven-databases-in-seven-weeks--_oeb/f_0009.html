<p id="N10138" class="calibre5">
Before reading this book, you should know what it won’t cover.
    </p>
<h3 class="calibre20">This Is Not an Installation Guide</h3>
<p id="N1013F" class="calibre5">
Installing the databases in this book is sometimes easy, sometimes challenging, and sometimes downright ugly.  For some databases, you’ll be able to use stock packages, and for others, you’ll need to compile from source.  We’ll point out some useful tips here and there, but by and large you’re on your own.  Cutting out installation steps allows us to pack in more useful examples and a discussion of concepts, which is what you really want anyway, right?
      </p>
<h3 class="calibre20">Administration Manual? We Think Not</h3>
<p id="N10146" class="calibre5">
Along the same lines of installation, this book will not cover everything you’d find in an administration manual.  Each of these databases has myriad options, settings, switches, and configuration details, most of which are well documented on the Web.  We’re more interested in teaching you useful concepts and full immersion than focusing on the day-to-day operations.  Though the characteristics of the databases can change based on operational settings—and we may discuss those characteristics—we won’t be able to go into all the nitty-gritty details of all possible configurations.  There simply isn’t space!
      </p>
<h3 class="calibre20">A Note to Windows Users</h3>
<p id="N1014D" class="calibre5">
      This book is inherently about choices, predominantly open source software on *nix platforms. Microsoft environments tend to strive for an integrated environment, which limits many choices to a smaller predefined set. As such, the databases we cover are open source and are developed by (and largely <span class="calibre6">for</span>) users of *nix systems.  This is not our own bias so much as a reflection of the current state of affairs.  Consequently, our tutorial-esque examples are presumed to be run in a *nix shell.  If you run Windows and want to give it a try anyway, we recommend setting up Cygwin<a id="FNPTR-1" href="f_0011.html#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> to give you the best shot at success.  You may also want to consider running a Linux virtual machine.

<h2 id="N10101" class="calibre18">Why Seven Databases</h2>
<p id="N10105" class="calibre5">
      As early as March 2010, we had wanted to write a NoSQL book.  The term had been gathering buzz, and although lots of people were talking about it, there seemed to be a fair amount of confusion around it too.  What exactly does the term <span class="calibre6">NoSQL</span> mean?  Which types of systems are included?  How is this going to impact the practice of making great software?  These were questions we wanted to answer—as much for ourselves as for others.

      After reading Bruce Tate’s exemplary <em class="calibre6">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages</em> [Tat10], we knew he was onto something.  The progressive style of introducing languages struck a chord with us.  We felt teaching databases in the same manner would provide a smooth medium for tackling some of these tough NoSQL questions.

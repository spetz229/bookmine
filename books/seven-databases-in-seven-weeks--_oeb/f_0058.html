  Now that we’ve made it through the databases, congratulations are in order!

  We hope you’ve gained an appreciation for these seven databases. If you use one in a project, we’ll be happy. And if you decide to use multiple databases, like we saw at the end of the Redis chapter, we’ll be ecstatic. We believe the future of data management lies in the polyglot persistence model (using more than one database in a project)—while the worldview of the general-purpose RDBMS fog drifts away.

  Let’s take this opportunity to see where our seven databases fit together in the greater database ecosystem. By this point, we have explored the details of each and mentioned a few commonalities and differences. We’ll see how they contribute to the vast and expanding landscape of data storage options.

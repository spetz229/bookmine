    Modern application scaling problems now fall largely in the realm of data management. We’ve reached a point in application evolution where programming language, framework, and operating system choice—even hardware and operations (thanks to virtual machine hosts and “the cloud”)—are becoming so cheap and easy as to become largely trivial problems driven as much by preference as necessity. If you want to scale your application in this age, you should think quite a bit about which database, or databases, you choose—it’s more than likely your true bottleneck. Helping you make this choice correctly was a leading purpose of this book.

    Although the book has come to a close, we trust your interest in polyglot persistence is wide open. The next steps from here are to pursue in detail the databases that piqued your interest or continue learning about other options like Cassandra, Drizzle, or OrientDB.

    It’s time to get your hands dirty.

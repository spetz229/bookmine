  Anyone who has worked construction knows that rebar is a steel beam used to reinforce concrete. Just like Riak (“Ree-ahck”), you never use only one, but the multiple parts working together make the overall system durable. Each component is cheap and expendable, but when used right, it’s hard to find a simpler or stronger structure upon which to build a foundation.
</p>
<p id="N124DA" class="calibre5">
  Riak is a distributed key-value database where values can be anything—from plain text, JSON, or XML to images or video clips—all accessible through a simple HTTP interface. Whatever data you have, Riak can store it.
</p>
<p id="N124DD" class="calibre5">
  Riak is also fault-tolerant. Servers can go up or down at any moment with no single point of failure. Your cluster continues humming along as servers are added, removed, or (ideally not) crash. Riak won’t keep you up nights worrying about your cluster—a failed node is not an emergency, and you can wait to deal with it in the morning. As core developer Justin Sheehy once noted, “[The Riak team] focused so hard on things like write availability…to go back to sleep.”
</p>
<p id="N124E0" class="calibre5">
  But this flexibility has some trade-offs. Riak lacks robust support for ad hoc queries, and key-value stores, by design, have trouble linking values together (in other words, they have no foreign keys). Riak attacks these problems on several fronts, which we’ll discover in the next few days.

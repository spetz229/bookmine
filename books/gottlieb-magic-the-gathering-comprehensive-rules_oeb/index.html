      <div class="paragraph">This document includes a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number.

So if you can’t find what you’re looking for, check the glossary.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">We at Wizards of the Coast recognize that no matter how detailed the rules, situations will arise in which the interaction of specific cards requires a precise answer.

        1. The Game <br class="calibre8"/>
      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">100. General</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.1. These <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> rules apply to any <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.1a A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.1b A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 6, “Multiplayer Rules.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.2. In constructed play, each player needs his or her own deck of at least sixty cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals. A constructed deck can have any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.3. For sealed deck or draft play, only forty cards are required in a deck, and a player may use as many duplicates of a card as he or she has. Each player still needs small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.4. There is no maximum deck size.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">100.5. Most <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> tournaments have special rules (not included here) and may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets. See the most current <strong class="calibre11">Magic: The Gathering</strong> DCI® Floor Rules for more information. They can be found at <del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home</strong></del>.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">101. Starting the Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.1. At the start of a game, each player shuffles his or her deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle his or her opponents’ decks. The players’ decks become their libraries.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.2. After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine who chooses which player goes first using any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.). In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game decides who will take the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the person who determined who would take the first turn in the previous game decides.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.3. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his or her life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.4. A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may mulligan. First, the starting player takes any mulligans. To take a mulligan, that player shuffles his or her hand back into the deck and then draws a new hand of six cards. He or she may repeat this process as many times as desired, drawing one fewer card each time, until the hand size reaches zero cards. Once the starting player has decided to keep a hand, those cards become his or her <em class="calibre9">opening hand.</em> Then each other player (in turn order) may take any number of mulligans. A player can’t take any mulligans once he or she has decided to keep an opening hand.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.4a The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the standard mulligan rule, with some modifications. First, the starting team takes any mulligans. For a team to take a mulligan, each player on that team decides whether or not to take a mulligan, then all players who chose to do so take their mulligans at the same time. The first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand of seven cards. After each player on that team who took a mulligan looks at his or her new hand, the team repeats the process. (Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.) Once a player has decided to keep a hand, those cards become his or her opening hand<em class="calibre9">.</em> That player can’t take any more mulligans, but his or her teammate may. Once each player on the starting team decides to keep an opening hand, the other team may take mulligans.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>Bob and Clare are the starting team in a Two-Headed Giant game. They’ve each draw seven cards. After reviewing each other’s hands, both Bob and Clare decide to mulligan. Each shuffles his or her hand into his or her deck and draws seven cards. Clare isn’t sure about Bob’s new hand, but he decides to keep it. Clare decides to take another mulligan. Bob’s hand becomes his opening hand, and Clare shuffles her hand into her deck and draws six cards. Then only Clare has the option to mulligan. She decides to keep her hand of six cards and that becomes her opening hand. After that, the other team decides whether to take mulligans.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands, the starting player takes his or her first turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.5a In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 304, “Draw Step”) of his or her first turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">101.5b In multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn. However, the Two-Headed Giant variant has a special rule: Although the starting team’s first draw step isn’t skipped, only the secondary player on that team draws a card during that step. See rule 606, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">102. Winning and Losing</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.1. A game ends immediately when either a player wins or the game is a draw.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.2. There are several ways to win the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.2a A player still in the game wins the game if all of that player’s opponents have lost the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.2b An effect may state that a player wins the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.2c. In a multiplayer game between teams, a team with at least one player still in the game wins the game if all other teams have lost the game. Each player on the winning team wins the game, even if one or more of those players had previously lost that game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3. There are several ways to lose the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3a A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes loses the game immediately.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3b If a player’s life total is 0 or less, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3c When a player is required to draw more cards than are left in his or her library, he or she draws the remaining cards, and then loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3d If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3e If a player would both win and lose simultaneously, he or she loses.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.3f In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all players on that team have lost.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.4. There are several ways to draw the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.4a If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.4b If the game somehow enters a “loop,” repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw. Loops that contain an optional action don’t result in a draw.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.4c In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw if all remaining teams lose at once.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">102.5. If a player loses the game, he or she leaves the game. Likewise, if a player leaves the game, he or she loses the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule 600.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">103. The Magic Golden Rules</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule 102.3a).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.2. When a rule or effect says something can happen and another effect says it can’t, the “can’t” effect wins. For example, if one effect reads “You may play an additional land this turn” and another reads “You can’t play land cards this turn,” the effect that keeps you from playing lands wins out. Note that adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. See rule 407, “Adding and Removing Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.3. If an instruction requires taking an impossible action, it’s ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A card reads “Each player sacrifices a creature.” First, the active player chooses a creature he or she controls. Then each of the nonactive players chooses a creature he or she controls. Then all creatures are sacrificed simultaneously.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.4a A player knows the choices made by the previous players when he or she makes his or her choice.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">103.4b If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order written, or in the order he or she chooses if the choices aren’t ordered.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">104. Numbers and Symbols</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.1. The <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game uses only natural numbers. You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, and so on. When a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.2. If a creature’s power or toughness, a mana cost, a player’s life total, or an amount of damage would be less than 0, it’s treated as 0 for all purposes except changing that total. If anything needs to use a number that can’t be determined, it uses 0 instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If a 3/3 creature gets -5/-0, it deals 0 damage in combat. But to raise its power back to 1, you’d have to give it +3/+0 (3 minus 5 plus 3 is 1).</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If you control no permanents, the “highest converted mana cost among permanents you control” can’t be determined, so 0 is used instead.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, {X}, {Y}, and {Z}; the numerals {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; and the snow symbol {S}.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3a Each of the colored mana symbols represents one colored mana: {W} is white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3b Numeral symbols (such as {1}) are generic mana costs and represent an amount of mana that can be paid with any color of, or colorless, mana.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3c The symbols {X}, {Y}, and {Z} represent unspecified amounts of mana; when playing a spell or activated ability with {X}, {Y}, or {Z} in its cost, its controller decides the value of that variable.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3d Numeral symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X}) can also represent colorless mana if they appear in the effect of a spell or ability that reads “add [mana symbol] to your mana pool” or something similar.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3e The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder when a spell or activated ability costs nothing to play. A spell or ability whose cost is {0} must still be played the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won’t play itself automatically.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3f Each of the hybrid mana symbols represents a cost that can be paid with one of two colors: {W/U} in a cost can be paid with either white or blue mana, {W/B} white or black, {U/B} blue or black, {U/R} blue or red, {B/R} black or red, {B/G} black or green, {R/G} red or green, {R/W} red or white, {G/W} green or white, and {G/U} green or blue.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> {G/W}{G/W} can be paid by spending {G}{G}, {G}{W}, or {W}{W}.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3g If an effect would add one mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that player chooses either of that symbol’s colors and adds one mana of that color to his or her mana pool.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.3h The snow mana symbol {S} represents a cost that can be paid with one mana produced by a snow permanent. This is a generic mana cost that can be paid with any color of, or colorless, mana. Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay don’t affect {S} costs.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.4. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means “Tap this permanent.” A permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped again to pay the cost. Creatures that haven’t been under a player’s control continuously since the beginning of his or her most recent turn can’t use any ability with the tap symbol in the cost. See rule 212.3d.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">104.5. A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many <em class="calibre9">Odyssey™</em> block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player’s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they’re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.</div>

        2. Parts of the Game <br class="calibre8"/>
      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">200. General</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.1. When a rule or text on a card refers to a “card,” it means a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card with a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card front and the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card back. Tokens aren’t considered cards-even a card that represents a token isn’t considered a card for rules purposes.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.1a A card’s owner is the player who started the game with it in his or her deck or, for cards that didn’t start the game in a player’s deck, the player who brought the card into the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.2. Use the Oracle™ card reference when determining a card’s wording. A card’s Oracle text can be found using the Gatherer card database at <del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">http://gatherer.wizards.com</strong></del>.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.3. A <em class="calibre9">player</em> is one of the people in the game. The <em class="calibre9">active player</em> is the player whose turn it is. The other players are <em class="calibre9">nonactive players.</em></div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.3a In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s <em class="calibre9">teammates</em> are the other players on his or her team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on his or her team.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.4. A <em class="calibre9">token</em> is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card. (See rule 216, “Tokens.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.4a A token’s owner is the player who controlled the spell or ability that put it into play. A token’s controller is the player who put it into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.5. A <em class="calibre9">spell</em> is a card, or copy of a spell or card, that’s on the stack. (See rule 213, “Spells.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.5a A spell’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it. A spell’s controller is the player who played it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.6. A <em class="calibre9">permanent</em> is a card or token that’s in play. (See rule 214, “Permanents.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.6a A nontoken permanent’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it. A permanent’s controller is the player who put it into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.7. An <em class="calibre9">ability</em> can be one of two things. First, it can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. Second, it can be text on an object that explains what the object does. (See rule 402, “Abilities,” and section 4, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.7a The owner of an ability on the stack is the player who controlled its source when it was played or triggered. The controller of an ability on the stack is the player who played the ability, or the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.8. An <em class="calibre9">object</em> is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, or a permanent. The term “object” is used in these rules when a rule applies to abilities on the stack, cards, tokens, spells, and permanents. Combat damage on the stack is also an object, although many uses of the term “object” in these rules don’t apply to it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.9. If a spell or ability uses a type or subtype without the word “card,” “spell,” or “source,” it means a permanent of that type in play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.9a If a spell or ability uses a type, supertype, or subtype in conjunction with the word “card” and the name of a zone, it means a card with that type in the stated zone.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">200.9b If a spell or ability uses a type, supertype, or subtype in conjunction with the word “spell,” it means a spell of that type on the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.9c If a spell or ability uses a type, supertype, or subtype in conjunction with the word “source,” it means a source of that type-either a source of an ability or a source of damage. See rule 419.8 “Sources of Damage.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">200.10. A <em class="calibre9">counter</em> is a marker placed on an object or player, either modifying its characteristics or interacting with an ability. A counter is not a token, and a token is not a counter. A +X/+Y counter on a permanent, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that permanent’s power and Y to that permanent’s toughness. Similarly, -X/-Y counters subtract from power and toughness. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">201. Characteristics</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">201.1. The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, type line, expansion symbol, text box, power and toughness, illustration credit, legal text, and collector number. Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">201.2. An object’s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, type, subtype, supertype, expansion symbol, rules text, abilities, power, and toughness. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">202. Name</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">202.1. The name of a card is printed on its upper left corner.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">202.2. Text that refers to the object it’s on by name means just that particular object and not any other duplicates of it, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">202.2a If an ability of an object uses a phrase such as “this [something]” to identify an object, where [something] is a characteristic, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isn’t the appropriate characteristic at the time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability reads “Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. Destroy that creature at end of turn.” The ability will destroy the object it gave +2/+2 at the end of the turn, even if that object isn’t a creature anymore.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">202.2b If an ability of an object grants to another object an ability that refers to the first object by name, the name refers only to the object whose ability grants that ability, not to any other object with the same name.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Saproling Burst has an ability that reads “Remove a fade counter from Saproling Burst: Put a green Saproling creature token into play. It has ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of fade counters on Saproling Burst.’” The ability granted to the token only looks at the Saproling Burst that created the token, not at any other Saproling Burst in play.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">202.3. Two cards have the same name if the English versions of their names are identical, regardless of anything else printed on the cards.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">203. Mana Cost and Color</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.1. The mana cost of a card is indicated by mana symbols printed on its upper right corner. If a card has no mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, it has no mana cost. Paying an object’s mana cost requires matching the color of any colored mana symbols as well as paying the generic mana indicated in the cost.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.1a Lands normally have no mana cost. Tokens have no mana cost unless the effect that creates them specifies otherwise. A copy of an object copies that object’s mana cost.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2a Objects with no colored mana symbols in their mana costs are colorless.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2b An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of those mana symbols. Most multicolored cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a card to be multicolored.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2c The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. The white mana symbol is represented by {W}, blue by {U}, black by {B}, red by {R}, and green by {G}.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An object with a mana cost of {2}{W} is white, an object with a mana cost of {2} is colorless, and one with a mana cost of {2}{W}{B} is both white and black.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2d If a player is asked to choose a color, he or she must choose one of the five colors. “Multicolored” is not a color.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.2e An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of that mana symbol, in addition to any other colors the object might be. Most cards with hybrid mana symbols in their mana costs are printed in a two-tone frame. See rule 104.3.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.3. The converted mana cost of an object is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its mana cost, regardless of color. Some effects ask a player to pay mana equal to an object’s converted mana cost; this cost may be paid with any combination of colored and/or colorless mana, regardless of the colors in the object’s mana cost.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A mana cost of {3}{U}{U} translates to a converted mana cost of 5.</em>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">203.3a The converted mana cost of an object with no mana cost is 0.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">203.4. Any additional cost listed in an object’s rules text or imposed by an effect isn’t part of the mana cost. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spell’s other costs.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">204. Illustration</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">204.1. The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no game significance. For example, a creature doesn’t have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it’s depicted as flying.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">205. Type Line</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.1. The type (and subtype and supertype, if applicable) of a card is printed directly below the illustration. (See rule 212, “Type, Supertype, and Subtype.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.2. Types</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.2a The types are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, and sorcery.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.2b. Some objects have more than one type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects satisfy the criteria for any effect that applies to any of their types.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3. Subtypes</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3a A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3b Subtypes are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each word after the dash is a separate subtype.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3c Subtypes of a [type] object are also called <em class="calibre9">[type] types. </em>For example, creature subtypes are also called creature types. Objects may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> “Basic Land – Mountain” means the card is a land with the Mountain subtype. “Creature – Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. “Artifact – Equipment” means the card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3d Most card types each have their own unique set of possible subtypes. (You can find complete lists of subtypes in the glossary at the end of this document under “Creature Types,” “Land Types,” and so on.) However, instants and sorceries can share subtypes. Collectively, instant and sorcery subtypes are called <em class="calibre9">spell types.</em></div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.3e If an artifact creature card has subtypes printed on its type line, those subtypes are creature types. If an artifact land card has subtypes printed on its type line, those types are land types.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.4. Supertypes</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.4a A card can also have one or more <em class="calibre9">supertypes.</em> These are printed directly before the card’s types. If an object’s types or subtypes change, any supertypes it has are kept, although they may not be relevant to the new type.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.4b Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">205.4c Any permanent with the supertype “legendary” is subject to the state-based effect for legendary permanents, also called the “legend rule” (see rule 420.5e).</div>

      <div class="paragraph">205.4e Any permanent with the supertype “snow” is a snow permanent. Any permanent that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonsnow permanent, regardless of its name.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">206. Expansion Symbol</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">206.1. The expansion symbol indicates which <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> set a card is from. It’s normally printed below the right edge of the illustration.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">206.2. The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver expansion symbol indicates the card is uncommon. A black or white expansion symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple expansion symbol signifies a special rarity; to date, only the <em class="calibre9">Time Spiral™</em> “timeshifted” cards, which were rarer than that set’s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the <em class="calibre9">Exodus™</em> set, all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the <em class="calibre9">Sixth Edition</em> core set, <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> core sets didn’t have expansion symbols at all.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">206.3. A spell or ability that affects cards from a particular set “looks” only for that set’s expansion symbol. A card reprinted in the core set receives the core set’s expansion symbol. Any reprinted version of the card no longer counts as part of its original set unless it was reprinted with that set’s expansion symbol. The first five editions of the core set had no expansion symbol.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">207. Text Box</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">207.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the card’s abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">207.2. The text box may also contain italicized reminder text (in parentheses), which summarizes a rule that applies to that card, and italicized flavor text, which has no game function, but like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">207.3. A guild icon appears in the text box of many <em class="calibre9">Ravnica™</em> block cards. These cards either have the specified guild’s exclusive mechanic or somehow relate to the two colors associated with that guild. Guild icons have no effect on game play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">208. Power/Toughness</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">208.1. A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed on its lower right corner. The first number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">208.2. Some creature cards have power and/or toughness of *, where * is a value determined by the abilities of that object. As long as the object is in play, the ability sets the value of *. The * is 0 while the object is not in play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">208.3 A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it’s a card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Licid that’s become an Aura).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">209. Illustration Credit</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">209.1. The illustration credit for a card is printed directly below the text box. The credit has no effect on game play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">210. Legal Text</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">210.1. Legal text (the fine print at the bottom of the card) lists the copyright information. It has no effect on game play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">211. Collector Number</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">211.1. Some card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total cards in the set], immediately following the legal text. These numbers have no effect on game play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">212. Type, Supertype, and Subtype</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1. General</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1a Cards, tokens, permanents, and spells can all have types, supertypes, and subtypes. Abilities don’t have types, supertypes, or subtypes. Instead, there are various categories of abilities. (See rule 402, “Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1b. When an object’s type changes, the new type(s) replaces any existing types. Counters, effects, and damage affecting the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new type. Similarly, when the subtypes of one of an object’s types change, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes of that type. If an object’s type is removed, the subtypes of its old type don’t exist in any way under the new type. Those subtypes disappear completely for the entire time the object’s type is removed. Removing an object’s subtype doesn’t affect its types at all.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1c Some effects change an object’s type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a prior type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the object’s prior types, supertypes, and subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use the phrase “in addition to its types” or that state that something is “still a [type].” Some effects state that an object becomes an “artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior types and subtypes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” The affected lands now have two types: creature and land. If there were any lands that also had the artifact type before the ability’s effect applied to them, those lands would become “artifact land creatures,” not just “creatures,” or “land creatures.” The effect allows them to retain both the artifact type and the land type.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability reads, “All artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.” If a permanent is both an artifact and an enchantment, it will become an “artifact enchantment creature.”</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1d An object’s supertype is independent of its type and subtype. Changing an object’s type or subtype won’t change its supertype. Changing an object’s supertype won’t change its type or subtype. When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” If any of the affected lands were legendary, they are still legendary.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.1e If an instruction requires choosing a subtype, you must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype you choose must be for the appropriate type. For example, you can’t choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type. (Use the Oracle card reference to determine whether a creature type exists; see rule 200.2. You can also find complete lists of subtypes in the glossary at the end of this document under “Creature Types,” “Land Types,” etc.)</div>

      <div class="paragraph">212.2d Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their type. Because artifacts have no colored mana in their mana costs, they’re colorless.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4a A player may play an enchantment card from his or her hand during a main phase of his or her turn, when he or she has priority and the stack is empty. Playing an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4b When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it into play under his or her control.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4c Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Enchantment – Shrine.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called <em class="calibre9">enchantment types.</em> Enchantments may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4d Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura comes into play attached to a permanent or player. What an Aura can be attached to is restricted by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 502.45, “Enchant”). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4e An Aura spell requires a target, which is restricted by its enchant ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4f If an Aura is enchanting an illegal permanent, or the permanent it was attached to no longer exists, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4g An Aura can’t enchant itself, and an Aura that’s also a creature can’t enchant a permanent. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4h The permanent an Aura is attached to is called <em class="calibre9">enchanted.</em> The Aura is attached to, or “enchants,” that permanent.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4i An Aura’s controller is separate from the enchanted permanent’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the permanent doesn’t change control of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Aura’s controller can play its abilities. However, if the Aura adds an ability to the enchanted permanent (with “gains” or “has”), the enchanted permanent’s controller is the only one who can play that ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4j If an Aura is coming into play by any means other than by being played and the effect putting it into play doesn’t specify the permanent or player the Aura will enchant, the player putting it into play chooses what it will enchant as the Aura comes into play. The player must choose a legal permanent or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects. If the player can’t make a legal choice, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of coming into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.4k If an effect attempts to attach an Aura in play to a permanent or player, that permanent or player must be able to be enchanted by it. If the permanent or player can’t be, the Aura doesn’t move.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">212.5. Instants</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.5a A player may play an instant card from his or her hand any time he or she has priority. Playing an instant as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.5b When an instant spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.5c Instant subtypes are always single words and are listed after a long dash: “Instant – Arcane.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype.

      <div class="paragraph">212.5d Instants can’t come into play. If an instant would come into play, it remains in its previous zone instead.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.5e If text states that a player may do something “any time he or she could play an instant,” it means only that the player must have priority. The player doesn’t need to have an instant he or she could actually play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6. Land</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6a A player may play a land card from his or her hand only during a main phase of his or her turn, and only when he or she has priority and the stack is empty. A land card isn’t a spell card, and at no time is it a spell. When a player plays a land card, it’s simply put into play. The land card doesn’t go on the stack, so players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6b A player may play only one land card during each of his or her own turns. Effects may allow the playing of additional lands; playing an additional land in this way doesn’t prevent a player from taking the normal action of playing a land. Players can’t begin to play a land that an effect prohibits from being played. As a player plays a land, he or she announces whether he or she is using the once-per-turn action of playing a land. If not, he or she specifies which effect is allowing the additional land play. Effects may also allow you to “put” lands into play. This isn’t the same as “playing a land” and doesn’t count as the player’s one land played during his or her turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6c Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called <em class="calibre9">land types.</em> Lands may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> “Basic Land – Mountain” means the card is a land with the Mountain subtype.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6d The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words “basic land type,” it’s referring to one of these subtypes. A land with a basic land type has an intrinsic ability to produce colored mana. (See rule 406, “Mana Abilities.”) The land is treated as if its text box included, “{T}: Add [mana symbol] to your mana pool,” even if the text box doesn’t actually contain text or the card has no text box. Plains produce white mana; Islands, blue; Swamps, black; Mountains, red; and Forests, green.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6e If an effect changes a land’s type to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text and its old land types, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesn’t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Changing a land’s subtype doesn’t add or remove any types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6f Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.6g If an object is both a land and another type, it can be played only as a land. It can’t be played as a spell.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7. Sorceries</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7a A player may play a sorcery card from his or her hand during a main phase of his or her turn, when he or she has priority and the stack is empty. Playing a sorcery as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7b When a sorcery spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7c Sorcery subtypes are always single words and are listed after a long dash: “Sorcery – Arcane.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Sorcery subtypes are also called <em class="calibre9">sorcery types.</em> A sorcery subtype that’s also an instant subtype is also called a <em class="calibre9">spell type. </em>Sorceries may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7d Sorceries can’t come into play. If a sorcery would come into play, it remains in its previous zone instead.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">212.7e If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only “any time he or she could play a sorcery,” it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of his or her turn, and the stack must be empty. The player doesn’t need to have a sorcery he or she could actually play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">213. Spells</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.1. Every nonland card is a spell while it’s being played (see rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities”) and while it’s on the stack. Once it’s played, a card remains a spell until it resolves, is countered, or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see rule 401, “Spells on the Stack.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.1a A nonexistent mana cost can’t be paid.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.2. A spell’s type, supertype, and subtype are the same as those of its card.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.3. The term “spell” is used to refer to a card while it’s on the stack. The term “card” isn’t used to refer to a card that’s on the stack as a spell. It’s only used to refer to a card that’s not in play or on the stack, such as a creature card in a player’s hand.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.4. Every spell has a controller. By default, a spell’s controller is the player who played it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">213.5. If an effect changes any characteristics of a spell that becomes a permanent, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it comes into play and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">214. Permanents</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">214.1. A permanent is a card or token in play. Permanents stay in play unless moved to another zone by an effect or rule. There are four types of permanents: artifacts, creatures, enchantments, and lands. Instant and sorcery cards can’t come into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">214.2. <em class="calibre9">Permanent type</em> is the type of a card or token that’s in play. A nontoken permanent’s types, supertypes, and subtypes are the same as those printed on its card. A token’s types, supertypes, and subtypes are set by the spell or ability that created it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">214.3. A card or token becomes a permanent when it comes into play and it stops being a permanent when it leaves play. Permanents come into play untapped. The term “permanent” is used to refer to a card or token while it’s in play. The term “card” isn’t typically used to refer to a card that’s in play as a permanent; rather, it’s nearly always used to refer to a card that’s not in play and not on the stack, such as a creature card in a player’s hand. For more information, see rule 217, “Zones.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">214.4. Every permanent has a controller. By default, a permanent’s controller is the player who put it into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">214.5. Every permanent has a value in each of three status categories: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, and face up/face down. By default, a permanent comes into play untapped, unflipped, and face up. For more information, see rule 510, “Status.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">215. This section is now empty. See rule 205.4c and rule 420.5e about legendary permanents.</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">216. Tokens</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">216.1. Some effects put token creatures into play. A token is controlled by whomever put it into play and owned by the controller of the spell or ability that created it. The spell or ability may define any number of characteristics for the token. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it. The spell or ability that creates the token sets both its name and its creature type. If the spell or ability doesn’t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its creature type(s). A “Goblin Scout creature token,” for example, is named “Goblin Scout” and has the creature subtypes Goblin and Scout. Once a token is in play, changing its name doesn’t change its creature type, and vice versa.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">216.2. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s type or subtype. A token isn’t a card (even if represented by cards from other games or <em class="calibre9">Unglued™</em> cards).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">216.3. A token in a zone other than the in-play zone ceases to exist. This is a state-based effect. (Note that a token changing zones sets off triggered abilities before the token ceases to exist.) Once a token has left play, it can’t be returned to play by any means.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">217. Zones</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally six zones: library, hand, graveyard, in play, stack, and removed from the game. Some older cards also use the ante and phased-out zones. Each player has his or her own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1a If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to the corresponding zone of its owner’s instead. If an instant or sorcery card would come into play, it remains in its previous zone instead.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1b The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when effects or rules allow it. Objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they’re tapped or flipped, and what enchants or equips them must remain clear to all players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1c An object that moves from one zone to another is treated as a new object. Effects connected with its previous location will no longer affect it. There are three exceptions to this rule: (1) Effects that change the characteristics of an artifact, creature, or enchantment spell on the stack will continue to apply to the permanent that spell creates. (2) Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, “When Rancor is put into a graveyard from play”) can find the object in the zone it moved to when the ability triggered. (3) Prevention effects that apply to damage from an artifact, creature, or enchantment spell on the stack will continue to apply to damage from the permanent that spell becomes.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1d If an object would move from one zone to another, first determine what event is moving the object. Then apply any appropriate replacement effects to that event. If an effect or rule tries to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s controller-or its owner if it has no controller-chooses what the effect does to the object. Then the event moves the object.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.1e An object is <em class="calibre9">outside the game</em> if it’s in the removed-from-the-game zone, or if it isn’t in any of the game’s zones. All other objects are inside the game. Outside the game is not a zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2. Library</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2a When a game begins, each player’s deck becomes his or her library.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2b Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in a library.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2c Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player’s library at any time.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2d If an effect puts two or more cards on the top or bottom of a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go into his or her library.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2e Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of his or her library revealed. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a spell or ability is being played, the new top card won’t be revealed until the spell or ability becomes played (see rule 409.1i).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.2f If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell or ability is being played, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell or ability becomes played (see rule 409.1i).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.3. Hand</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.3a The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn but not yet played. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a hand of seven cards. (See rule 101, “Starting the Game.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.3b Each player has a <em class="calibre9">maximum hand size</em>, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in his or her hand, but as part of his or her cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.3c A player may arrange his or her hand in any convenient fashion and look at it as much as he or she wishes. A player can’t look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.4. Graveyard</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.4a A graveyard is a discard pile. Any object that’s countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its owner’s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that’s finished resolving. Each player’s graveyard starts out empty.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.4b Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but can’t change their order.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.4c If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.5. In Play</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.5a Most of the area between the players represents the in-play zone. The in-play zone starts out empty. Permanents a player controls (other than Auras attached to another player’s permanents) are kept in front of him or her in the in-play zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.5b A spell or ability affects and checks only the in-play zone unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone. Permanents exist only in the in-play zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.5c Whenever a permanent enters the in-play zone, it’s considered a brand-new permanent and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same object. This is also true for any objects entering any zone (see rule 217.1c).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.5d An object not in the in-play zone isn’t “in play” and isn’t considered tapped or untapped. Objects that aren’t either in play or on the stack aren’t controlled by any player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6. Stack</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6a When a spell is played, the physical card is put on the stack. When an ability is played, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it. (See rule 409.1, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6b The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, it’s put on top of all objects already there. (See rule 408, “Timing of Spells and Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6c Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability that’s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the person who played the spell. The controller of an activated ability is the player who played the ability. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6d When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.6e Combat damage also uses the stack, in the same way as other objects that use the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.7. Removed from the Game</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.7a Effects can remove objects from the game. Some effects may provide a way for a card to return to a zone and use the term “set aside.” Cards that are set aside this way are still removed from the game, even though that removal may be temporary. Objects that aren’t cards can’t be returned in any way.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.7b Cards in the removed-from-the-game zone are kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards “removed from the game face down” can’t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.7c Cards that might return to play should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">217.7d A card may have one ability printed on it that removes one or more cards from the game, and another ability that refers either to “the removed cards” or to cards “removed from the game with [name].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the removed-from-the-game zone removed as a result of the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">

        3. Turn Structure <br class="calibre8"/>
      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">300. General</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.1. A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and end. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning, combat, and end phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.2. A phase or step ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession. No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps. Simply having the stack become empty doesn’t cause the phase or step to end; all players have to pass with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before the current phase or step ends.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.3. When a phase ends (but not a step), any unused mana left in a player’s mana pool is lost. That player loses 1 life for each one mana lost this way. This is called mana burn. Mana burn is loss of life, not damage, so it can’t be prevented or altered by effects that affect damage. This game action doesn’t use the stack. (See rule 406, “Mana Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.4. When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last “until end of” that phase or step expire. When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last “until” that phase or step expire. Effects that last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat step. Effects that last “until end of turn” are subject to special rules; see rule 314.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.5. When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step are added to the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.6. Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the current turn. If a player gets multiple extra turns or if multiple players get extra turns during a single turn, the extra turns are added one at a time. The most recently created turn will be taken first.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.7. Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur first.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.8. Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified step (or directly before a specified step). If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most recently created step will occur first.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">300.9. Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to proceed past it as though it didn’t exist. See rule 419.6e and rule 419.6f.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">301. Beginning Phase</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">301.1. The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap, upkeep, and draw.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">302. Untap Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">302.1 First, all permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out objects that the active player controlled when they phased out simultaneously phase in (this game action doesn’t use the stack). See rule 217.8, “Phased Out,” and rule 502.15, “Phasing.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">302.2. Next the active player determines which permanents he or she controls will untap. Then he or she untaps them all simultaneously (this game action doesn’t use the stack). Normally, all of a player’s permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents from untapping.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">302.3. No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells or abilities can be played or resolved. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule 303, “Upkeep Step.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">303. Upkeep Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">303.1. As the upkeep step begins, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of that upkeep step and any abilities that triggered during the turn’s untap step go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">304. Draw Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">304.1 First, the active player draws a card. This game action doesn’t use the stack. Then any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the draw step and any other abilities that have triggered go on the stack. Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">305. Main Phase</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">305.1. There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase, known as the precombat main phase, and the second main phase, known as the postcombat main phase, are separated by the combat phase (see rule 306, “Combat Phase”). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and collectively known as the <em class="calibre9">main phase.</em></div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">305.2. The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack is empty. (See rule 300.2.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">305.3. As the main phase begins, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of that main phase go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities. (This is the only phase in which a player can normally play artifact, creature, enchantment, and sorcery spells, and only the active player may play these spells.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">305.4. During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from his or her hand if the stack is empty, if the player has priority, and if he or she hasn’t yet taken this special action this turn. (See rule 212.6, “Lands.”) This action doesn’t use the stack and it isn’t a spell or ability of any kind. It can’t be countered, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">306. Combat Phase</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.1. The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no creatures are declared as attackers (see rule 308.4). There are two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 502.2) or double strike (see rule 502.28).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.2. A creature is removed from combat if it leaves play (such as by being destroyed or removed from the game), if it regenerates (see rule 419.6b), if its controller changes, if it stops being a creature, or if an effect removes it from combat. <em class="calibre9">Removed from combat</em> means the creature stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked, and/or unblocked creature.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.2a Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature, spells or abilities that would have kept that creature from attacking or blocking don’t remove the creature from combat.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.2b Tapping or untapping a creature that’s already been declared as an attacker or blocker doesn’t remove it from combat and doesn’t prevent its combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.3. During the combat phase, the active player is <em class="calibre9">attacking</em> and is the <em class="calibre9">attacking player</em>. As the combat phase starts, the active player chooses one of his or her opponents. The chosen opponent is <em class="calibre9">being attacked</em> and is the <em class="calibre9">defending player</em>. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. See rule 602, “Attack Multiple Players Option” and rule 606, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">306.4. An attacking creature is <em class="calibre9">attacking alone</em> if no other creatures are attacking. A blocking creature is <em class="calibre9">blocking alone</em> if no other creatures are blocking.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">307. Beginning of Combat Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">307.1. As the beginning of combat step begins, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of combat go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">308. Declare Attackers Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.1. As the declare attackers step begins, the active player declares attackers (this game action doesn’t use the stack). If the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, he or she declares which player each creature is attacking. Effects from a creature that refer to a defending player refer only to the defending player it is attacking. Then any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Tanglewalker reads, “Creatures you control are unblockable as long as defending player controls an artifact land.” Whether a creature you control is unblockable depends only on whether the player being attacked by it controls an artifact land.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Guiltfeeder reads, in part, “Whenever Guiltfeeder attacks and isn’t blocked, defending player loses 1 life for each card in his or her graveyard.” Only the player being attacked loses life due to Guiltfeeder’s ability.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration was illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 422, “Handling Illegal Actions,” and rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks”).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2a The active player either chooses to not attack, or chooses one or more creatures he or she controls and then determines whether this set of creatures could attack. Only creatures can attack, and the following creatures can’t attack: tapped creatures (even those that can attack without tapping) and creatures the active player didn’t control continuously since the beginning of the turn (except those with haste). Other effects may also affect whether or not a set of creatures could attack. (See rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2b If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a <em class="calibre9">bands with other</em> ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule 502.10, “Banding.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2c The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it’s declared as an attacker isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2d If any of the creatures require paying costs to attack, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2e If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to play mana abilities (see rule 411, “Playing Mana Abilities”).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2f Once the player has enough mana in his or her mana pool, he or she pays all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.2g Each chosen creature becomes an attacking creature if all costs have been paid, but only if it’s still controlled by the active player. It remains an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 306.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.3. Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition. They will not trigger if a creature is put into play attacking.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A permanent has the ability “Whenever a green creature attacks, destroy that creature at end of combat.” If a blue creature attacks and is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">308.4. If no creatures are declared as attackers, finish the declare attackers step, but skip the declare blockers and combat damage steps.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">309. Declare Blockers Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.1. As the declare blockers step begins, the defending player declares blockers (this game action doesn’t use the stack). Then any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.2. To declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration was illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 422, “Handling Illegal Actions,” and rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks”).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.2a The defending player chooses zero or more creatures he or she controls, chooses one attacking creature for each one to block, then determines whether this set of blocks is legal. Only untapped creatures can block, but blocking does not cause creatures to tap. Other effects may also affect whether or not a set of creatures could block. (See rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.2b If any of the creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.2e Each chosen creature becomes a blocking creature, but only if it’s controlled by the defending player. Each one is blocking the attacking creature chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 306.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.2f An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no blockers becomes an unblocked creature. This remains unchanged until the creature is removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. (Some effects can change whether a creature is blocked or unblocked.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.3. Abilities that trigger on a creature blocking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as a blocker. They will not trigger if a creature blocks, and then that creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition. They will not trigger if a creature is put into play blocking.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">309.4. Abilities that trigger on a creature becoming blocked trigger only at the first point the creature becomes blocked that combat. They will trigger if a creature becomes blocked by a creature declared as a blocker, by a creature that’s put into play as a blocker, or by an effect, but only if the attacking creature hadn’t yet been blocked that combat. They will not trigger if a creature becomes blocked, and then the blocking creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition.</div>

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">310. Combat Damage Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.1. As the combat damage step begins, the active player announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. Then the defending player announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage. All assignments of combat damage go on the stack as a single object. Then any abilities that triggered on damage being assigned go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2. A player may divide a creature’s combat damage as he or she chooses among the legal recipients. Dividing combat damage is subject to the following restrictions:</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2a Each attacking creature and each blocking creature will assign combat damage equal to its power. Creatures with 0 or less power don’t assign combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2b An unblocked attacking creature will assign all its combat damage to the defending player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2c A blocked creature will assign combat damage, divided as its controller chooses, to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it will assign no combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2d A blocking creature will assign combat damage, divided as its controller chooses, to the attacking creatures it’s blocking. If it isn’t currently blocking any creatures (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it will assign no combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.2e An effect that states a creature deals its combat damage in a different manner than normal affects the assignment of combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.3. Although combat-damage assignments go on the stack as an object, they aren’t spells or abilities, so they can’t be countered.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.4. Combat damage resolves as an object on the stack. When it resolves, it’s all dealt at once, as originally assigned. After combat damage finishes resolving, the active player gets priority.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.4a Combat damage is dealt as it was originally assigned even if the creature dealing damage is no longer in play, its power has changed, or the creature receiving damage has left combat.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.4b The source of the combat damage is the creature as it currently exists, or as it most recently existed if it is no longer in play.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">310.5. At the start of the combat damage step, if at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 502.2) or double strike (see rule 502.28), creatures without first strike or double strike don’t assign combat damage. Instead of proceeding to end of combat, the phase gets a second combat damage step to handle the remaining creatures. In the second combat damage step, surviving attackers and blockers that didn’t assign combat damage in the first step, plus any creatures with double strike, assign their combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">311. End of Combat Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">311.1. As the end of combat step begins, all “at end of combat” abilities trigger and go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">311.2. As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures are removed from combat. After the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and the postcombat main phase begins.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">312.1. The end phase consists of two steps: end of turn and cleanup.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">313. End of Turn Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">313.1. As the end of turn step begins, all abilities that trigger “at end of turn” go on the stack. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">313.2. If “at end of turn”-triggered abilities are created or if cards with “at end of turn”-triggered abilities come into play after preexisting ones have already gone on the stack at the beginning of the end of turn step, those abilities won’t go on the stack until the next turn’s end phase. In other words, the step doesn’t “back up” so new “at end of turn”-triggered abilities can go on the stack. This only applies to triggered abilities that say “at end of turn.” It doesn’t apply to continuous effects whose durations say “until end of turn” or “this turn.” (See rule 314, “Cleanup Step.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">314. Cleanup Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">314.1. If the active player’s hand contains more cards than his or her maximum hand size (normally seven), he or she discards enough cards to reduce the hand size to that number (this game action doesn’t use the stack).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">314.2. After discarding, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage is removed from permanents and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end (this game action doesn’t use the stack).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">314.3. If the conditions for any state-based effects exist or if any triggered abilities are waiting to be put onto the stack, the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities. Once the stack is empty and all players pass, another cleanup step begins. Otherwise, no player receives priority and the step ends.</div>

        4. Spells, Abilities, and Effects <br class="calibre8"/>
      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">400. General</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">400.1. An ability is something an object does or can do. Abilities generate effects. An object’s abilities are defined in the object’s text box (if it has one) or by the effect that created the object. Abilities can also be granted to objects by effects. Reminder text and flavor text are not abilities. Reminder text and flavor text always appear in italics.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">400.2. Spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities generate effects when they resolve. Static abilities generate continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">401. Spells on the Stack</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.1. A card on the stack is a spell. As the first step of being played, the card becomes a spell and goes on the stack from the zone it was played from (usually the player’s hand). (See rule 217.6, “Stack.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.1a A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.1b A nonexistent mana cost can’t be paid.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.2. A spell stops being a spell when it resolves (see rule 413, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”), is countered (see rule 414, “Countering Spells and Abilities”), or otherwise leaves the stack.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A played creature card is a creature spell until it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.3. Instant and sorcery spells have abilities, just like any other objects. These abilities are instructions that are followed when the spells resolve, unless the instructions can only be applied at some other time.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Some abilities that are not followed when the spell resolves are activated abilities or triggered abilities, any abilities that define the zone from which it can be played (see rule 401.4), any abilities that apply while the spell is in a zone from which it can be played (see rule 401.5), or any abilities that apply while the spell is on the stack (see rule 401.6).</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.4. Any object can have static abilities that allow it to be played from a zone other than a player’s hand. These abilities are active while the object is in that zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.5. Any object can have static abilities that apply while the object is in a zone from which it can be played. These include restrictions on playing the object and abilities that allow the object to be played at a time that it otherwise could not or in a manner that it otherwise could not.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.6. Any spell can have static abilities that apply while the spell is on the stack. These include, but are not limited to, additional costs, alternative costs, and cost reductions. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">401.7. As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the card is put into its owner’s graveyard. As the final part of an artifact, creature, or enchantment spell’s resolution, the card becomes a permanent and is put into the in-play zone under the control of the spell’s controller. If any spell is countered, the card is put into its owner’s graveyard as part of the resolution of the countering spell or ability. (See rule 413, “Resolving Spells and Activated Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">402. Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.1. An ability is text on an object that’s not reminder text or flavor text (see rule 400.1). The result of following such an instruction is an effect. (See rule 416, “Effects.”) Abilities can affect the objects they’re on; they can also affect other objects and/or players. Abilities can grant abilities to other objects or to the objects they’re on; they do so when the words “has,” “have,” “gains,” or “gain” are used.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.2. There are three general categories of abilities: activated, triggered, and static. Activated and triggered abilities can also be mana abilities. Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some effects are replacement effects or prevention effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.3. Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> “[This creature] can’t block” is an ability.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.4. An additional cost or alternative cost to play a card is an ability of the card.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.5. An ability isn’t a spell and therefore can’t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Abilities can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities, as well as by the rules (for example, an ability with one or more targets is countered if all its targets become illegal).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.6. Once activated or triggered, an ability exists independently of its source as an ability on the stack. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, “Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage to target creature or player”) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source because the effect needs to be divided checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in play, its last known information is used.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.7. An object may have multiple abilities. Aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 502, “Keyword Abilities”), each paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate ability. An object may also have multiple instances of the same ability. Each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8. Abilities of an instant or sorcery usually function only while the object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is in play. The exceptions are as follows:</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8a A characteristic-setting ability that sets type, subtype, supertype, or color functions in all zones.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8b An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8c An ability of an object that modifies what it costs to play functions on the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8d An object’s ability that restricts or modifies how that object can be played functions in any zone from which it could be played.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8e An object’s activated ability that has a cost that can’t be paid while the object is in play functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8f A trigger condition that can trigger only in a zone other than the in-play zone triggers from that zone. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Absolver Thrull has the ability “When Absolver Thrull comes into play or the creature it haunts is put into a graveyard, destroy target enchantment.” The first trigger condition triggers from the in-play zone and the second trigger condition functions from the removed-from-the-game zone.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">402.8g An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it’s on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless that ability’s trigger condition, or a previous part of that ability’s cost or effect, specifies that the object is put into that zone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Necrosavant says “{3}{B}{B}, Sacrifice a creature: Return Necrosavant from your graveyard to play. Play this ability only during your upkeep.” A player may play this ability only if Necrosavant is in his or her graveyard.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">403. Activated Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">403.1. An activated ability is written as “[cost]: [effect].” The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by the player who is playing it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">403.2. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can play its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">403.3. If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, “Play this ability only once each turn”), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">403.4. A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) in its activation cost can’t be played unless the creature has been under its controller’s control since the start of his or her most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 502.5).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">403.5. Activated abilities that read “Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery” mean the player must follow the timing rules for playing a sorcery, though the ability isn’t actually a sorcery. Activated abilities that read “Play this ability only any time you could play an instant” mean the player must follow the timing rules for playing an instant, though the ability isn’t actually an instant.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">404. Triggered Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.1. A triggered ability begins with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” The phrase containing one of these words is the trigger condition, which defines the trigger event.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.2. Triggered abilities aren’t played. Instead, a triggered ability automatically “triggers” each time its trigger event occurs. Once an ability has triggered, it goes on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 408.1, “Timing, Priority, and the Stack,” and rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.3. A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At . . . , if [condition], [effect].” The ability checks for the stated condition to be true when the trigger event occurs. If it is, the ability triggers. On resolution, the ability rechecks the condition. If the condition isn’t true at either of those times, the ability does nothing. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. Note that the word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.4. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.4a Delayed triggered abilities come from spells or other abilities that create them on resolution. That means a delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Part of an effect reads “When this creature leaves play,” but the creature in question leaves play before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed ability never triggers.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If an effect reads “When this creature becomes untapped” and the named creature becomes untapped before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.4b A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once-the next time its trigger event occurs-unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.4c A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that reads “Destroy that creature at end of turn” will destroy the permanent even if it’s no longer a creature during the end of turn step.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.4d A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular permanent will fail if the permanent leaves play (even if it returns again before the specified time). Similarly, abilities that create a one-shot effect that applies to an object in a particular zone will fail if the object leaves that zone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that reads “Remove this creature from the game at end of turn” won’t do anything if the creature leaves play before the end of turn step.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">404.5. Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to a triggered ability. These objects combine both abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by the triggered ability. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that reads “Reveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land card this way, draw a card” is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that reads “The controller of enchanted creature sacrifices it at the end of his or her turn” is a triggered ability.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">405. Static Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">405.1. A static ability does something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. The ability isn’t played-it just “exists.” Such abilities apply only while the ability is on a permanent in play, unless the ability is covered by rule 402.8.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">405.2. Some objects have intrinsic static abilities which state that the object “has” one or more characteristic values; “is” one or more particular types, supertypes, subtypes, or colors; or that one or more of its characteristics “is” or “are” a particular value. These abilities are characteristic-setting abilities. Abilities of an object that affect the characteristics of another object are not characteristic-setting abilities; neither are abilities that an object grants to itself. See rule 201, “Characteristics,” and rule 418.5a.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">405.2a A characteristic-setting ability that states that an object is one or more particular types, supertypes, subtypes, or colors applies no matter which zone the object it’s on is in. This rule doesn’t apply to other characteristic-setting abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">406. Mana Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.1. A mana ability is either <em class="calibre9">(a)</em> an activated ability that could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves or <em class="calibre9">(b)</em> a triggered ability that triggers from a mana ability and could produce additional mana. A mana ability can generate other effects at the same time it produces mana.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.2. Spells that put mana into a player’s mana pool aren’t mana abilities. They’re played and resolved exactly like any other spells. Triggered abilities that put mana into a player’s mana pool aren’t mana abilities if they trigger from events other than activating mana abilities. They go on the stack and resolve like any other triggered abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.3. A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A permanent has an ability that reads “{T}: Add {G} to your mana pool for each creature you control.” This is still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.4. A mana ability can be activated or triggered. Mana abilities are played and resolved like other abilities, but they don’t go on the stack, so they can’t be countered or responded to. See rule 411, “Playing Mana Abilities,” and rule 408.2, “Actions That Don’t Use the Stack.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.5. Abilities (other than mana abilities) that trigger on playing mana abilities do use the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">406.6. If a mana ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If you control no lands, an ability that reads “{T}: Add to your mana pool one mana of any type that a land you control could produce” will not produce any mana.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">407. Adding and Removing Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">407.1. Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object “gains” or “has” that ability. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object “loses” that ability. If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. (See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">407.2. An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object “gains” or “has” an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (“[permanent] is [characteristic value]”), it’s not granting an ability. (See rule 405.2.)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An effect reads, “Enchanted creature has ‘This creature is an artifact creature.’” This effect grants an ability to the creature that can be removed by other effects. Another effect reads, “Enchanted creature is an artifact creature.” This effect simply defines a characteristic of the creature. It doesn’t grant an ability, so effects that would cause the creature to lose its abilities wouldn’t cause the enchanted creature to stop being an artifact.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">407.3. Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If a creature with flying is enchanted with Flight, it has two instances of the flying ability. A single effect that reads “Target creature loses flying” will remove both.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">408. Timing of Spells and Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1. Timing, Priority, and the Stack</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1a Spells and activated abilities can be played only at certain times and follow a set of rules for doing so.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1b Spells and activated abilities are played by players (if they choose) using a system of priority, while other types of abilities and effects are automatically generated by the game rules. Each time a player would get priority, all applicable state-based effects resolve first as a single event (see rule 420, “State-Based Effects”). Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities”). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based effects or triggered abilities are generated. Then the player who would have received priority does so and may play a spell or ability, take a special action (such as playing a land), or pass, as governed by the rules for that phase or step.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1c The active player gets priority at the beginning of most phases and steps, after any game actions are dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step go on the stack. No player gets priority during the untap step and players usually don’t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 314.3). The player with priority may play a spell or ability, take a special action, or pass. If he or she plays a spell or ability, or takes a special action, the player again receives priority; otherwise, the next player in turn order receives priority. If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active player receives priority. If the stack is empty when all players pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1d A player may play an instant spell or an activated ability any time he or she has priority. Spells other than instants may be played during a player’s main phase, when that player has priority and the stack is empty.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1e When a spell is played, it goes on top of the stack. When an activated ability is played, it goes on top of the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">408.1f Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including during the playing or resolution of a spell or another ability. However, nothing actually happens at the time the abilities trigger. Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered is put on the stack (if it hasn’t already been put on the stack). Then the player gets priority and may play spells or abilities. (See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">409. Playing Spells and Activated Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1. Playing a spell or activated ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the playing of a spell or ability, a player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the spell was played illegally; the game returns to the moment before that spell or ability was played (see rule 422, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1a The player announces that he or she is playing the spell or activated ability. It moves from the zone it’s in to the stack and remains there until it’s countered or resolves. In the case of spells, the physical card goes onto the stack. In the case of activated abilities, the ability goes onto the stack without any card associated with it. If the ability is being played from a hidden zone, the card with that ability is revealed. Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated ability on the stack has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the player who played the spell. The controller of an activated ability is the player who played the ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1b If the spell or ability is modal (uses the phrase “Choose one -” or “[specified player] chooses one -”), the player announces the mode choice. If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell, he or she reveals those cards in his or her hand. If the spell or ability has a variable mana cost (indicated by {X}) or some other variable cost, the player announces the value of that variable at this time. If the spell or ability has alternative, additional, or other special costs (such as buyback, kicker, or convoke costs), the player announces his or her intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule 409.1f). You can’t apply two alternative methods of playing or two alternative costs to a single spell or ability. Previously made choices (such as choosing to play a spell with flashback from his or her graveyard or choosing to play a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1c If the spell or ability requires any targets, the player first announces how many targets he or she will choose (if the spell or ability has a variable number of targets), then announces the targets themselves. A player can’t play a spell or ability unless he or she chooses the required number of legal targets. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object, player, or zone can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If an ability reads “Tap two target creatures,” then the same target can’t be chosen twice; the ability requires two different legal targets. An ability that reads “Destroy target artifact and target land,” however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word “target” in multiple places.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1d If the spell or ability targets one or more targets only if an alternative, additional, or special cost (such as a buyback or kicker cost) is paid for it, or if a particular mode is chosen for it, its controller chooses those targets only if he or she announced the intention to pay that cost or chose that mode. Otherwise, the spell or ability is played as though it did not have those targets.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1e If the spell or ability affects several targets in different ways, the player announces how it will affect each target. If the spell or ability requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, or any number of untargeted objects or players, the player announces the division. Each of these targets, objects, or players must receive at least one of whatever is being divided.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1f The player determines the total cost of the spell or ability. Usually this is just the mana cost (for spells) or activation cost (for abilities). Some cards list additional or alternative costs in their text, and some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost, activation cost, or alternative cost, plus all cost increases and minus all cost reductions. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1g If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to play mana abilities (see rule 411, “Playing Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be played before costs are paid.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1h The player pays the total cost in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> You play Death Bomb, which costs {3}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to play. Because a spell’s total cost is “locked in” before payments are actually made, you pay {2}{B}, not {3}{B}, even though you’re sacrificing the Familiar.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.1i Once the steps described in 409.1a-409.1h are completed, the spell or ability becomes played. Any abilities that trigger on a spell or ability being played or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell or ability’s controller had priority before playing it, he or she gets priority.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.2. Some spells and abilities specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being played, such as choose a mode, choose targets, or choose how the spell or ability will affect its targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the spell or ability’s controller normally would do so.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.2a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spell or ability’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.2b If the spell or ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell or ability is being played, the spell’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 103.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.3. Playing a spell or ability that alters costs won’t do anything to spells and abilities that are already on the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">409.4. A player can’t begin to play a spell or activated ability that’s prohibited from being played by an effect.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">410. Handling Triggered Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.1. Because they aren’t played, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to play spells and abilities, and effects that prevent abilities from being played don’t affect them.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability triggers. When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger. The ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. The ability doesn’t do anything when it triggers, but it’s automatically put on the stack by its controller as soon as a player would receive priority.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.3. If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in APNAP order, puts triggered abilities he or she controls on the stack in any order he or she chooses. (See rule 103.4.) Then players once again check for and resolve state-based effects until none are generated, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based effects are generated and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.4. When a triggered ability goes on the stack, the controller of the ability makes any choices that would be required while playing an activated ability, following the same procedure (see rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities”). If no legal choice can be made (or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal), the ability is simply removed from the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.5. Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.6. An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences. See also rule 410.9.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever a land is put into a graveyard from play, . . . .” If someone plays a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once for each land put into the graveyard during the spell’s resolution.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.7. An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if all the damage is prevented.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.8. Triggered abilities with a condition directly following the trigger event (for example, “When/Whenever/At [trigger], if [condition], [effect]”), check for the condition to be true as part of the trigger event; if it isn’t, the ability doesn’t trigger. The ability checks the condition again on resolution. If it’s not satisfied, the ability does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. Note that this rule doesn’t apply to any triggered ability with an “if” condition elsewhere within its text. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9. Some abilities trigger when creatures block or are blocked in combat. (See rules 306-311 and rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”) They may trigger once or repeatedly, depending on the wording of the ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9a An ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] blocks, . . .” triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers only if the creature is declared as a blocker.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9b An ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] blocks a creature, . . .” triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers only if the creature is declared as a blocker.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9c An ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked, . . .” triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it’s blocked by multiple creatures. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but only if it hadn’t already been blocked that combat. It will trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9d An ability that reads “Whenever a creature blocks [this creature], . . .” triggers once for each creature that blocks the named creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, even if it had already been blocked that combat. It won’t trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.9e If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when the attack or block declaration is made. Effects that add or remove blockers can cause such abilities to trigger. This also applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common types of zone-change triggers are comes-into-play triggers and leaves-play triggers.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10a Comes-into-play abilities trigger when a permanent enters the in-play zone. These are written, “When [this object] comes into play, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] comes into play, . . .” Each time an event puts one or more permanents into play, all permanents in play (including the newcomers) are checked for any comes-into-play triggers that match the event.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10b Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is in play (and not before then). The permanent is never in play with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is in play, however (see rule 410.10e).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If an effect reads “All lands are creatures” and a land card is played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it enters play, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a creature comes into play. Conversely, if an effect reads “All creatures lose all abilities” and a creature card with a comes-into-play triggered ability enters play, that effect will cause it to lose its abilities the moment it enters play, so the comes-into-play ability won’t trigger.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10c Leaves-play abilities trigger when a permanent leaves the in-play zone. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves play, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a graveyard from play, . . . .” An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left play checks for it only in the first zone that it went to.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10d Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions. Continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities must be treated specially because the object with the ability may no longer be in play, no longer be in a zone visible to all players, or no longer be controlled by the appropriate player. The game has to “look back in time” to determine if these abilities trigger. Abilities that trigger specifically when an object leaves play, when an object leaves any visible zone for a hidden one, or when a player loses control of an object will trigger based on their existence, and the appearance of objects, prior to the event rather than afterward.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Two creatures are in play along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a creature is put into a graveyard from play, you gain 1 life.” Someone plays a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at the same time as the creatures.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10e Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] comes into play with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] comes into play . . . ,” “[This permanent] comes into play as . . . ,” or “[This permanent] comes into play tapped.” Such text is a static ability-not a triggered ability-whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.10f Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving play. These triggered abilities can track the Aura to its owner’s graveyard in addition to tracking the enchanted permanent to whatever zone it moved to.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">410.11. Some triggered abilities trigger on a game state, such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular type, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based effects.) A state-triggered ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A permanent’s ability reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.” If its controller plays the last card from his or her hand, the ability will trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has resolved. If its controller plays a spell that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the ability will trigger during the spell’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">411. Playing Mana Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">411.1. To play a mana ability, the player announces that he or she is playing it and pays the activation cost, following the steps in rules 409.1b-i. It resolves immediately after it is played and doesn’t go on the stack. (See rule 408.2e.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">411.2. A player may play an activated mana ability whenever he or she has priority, or whenever he or she is playing a spell or activated ability that requires a mana payment. A player may also play one whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment, even in the middle of playing or resolving a spell or ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">411.3. Triggered mana abilities trigger when an activated mana ability is played. These abilities resolve immediately after the mana ability that triggered them, without waiting for priority. If an activated or triggered ability produces both mana and another effect, both the mana and the other effect resolve immediately.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An enchantment reads, “Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of that type to his or her mana pool.” If a player taps lands for mana while playing a spell, the additional mana is added to the player’s mana pool immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">411.3a If a triggered mana ability adds mana “of the same type” or “of the same color” to a player’s mana pool and the mana ability that triggered it produced more than one type or color of mana, the player to whose mana pool the mana is being added chooses which type or color of mana the triggered ability adds.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">412. Handling Static Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">412.1. A static ability may generate a continuous effect or a prevention or replacement effect. These effects last as long as the object with the static ability remains in the appropriate zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">412.2. Many Auras and Equipment have static abilities that modify the permanent they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that permanent. If an Aura or Equipment is moved to a different permanent, the ability stops applying to the original permanent and starts modifying the new one.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">412.3. Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to play . . . ,” “You may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may play [this object] without paying its mana cost” work while a spell is on the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">412.4. Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may play [this card] . . .,” “You can’t play [this card] . . .,” and “Play [this card] only . . . .”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">412.5. Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can’t use an object’s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">413. Resolving Spells and Abilities</h5>

      <div class="paragraph">413.1. Each time all players pass in succession, the object (a spell, an ability, or combat damage) on top of the stack resolves. (See rule 416, “Effects.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2. Resolution of a spell or ability may involve several steps. These steps are followed in the order listed below.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2a If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target that’s removed from play, or from the zone designated by the spell or ability, is illegal. A target may also become illegal if its characteristics changed since the spell or ability was played or if an effect changed the text of the spell. The spell or ability is countered if all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now illegal. If the spell or ability is not countered, it will resolve normally, affecting only the targets that are still legal. If a target is illegal, the spell or ability can’t perform any actions on it or make the target perform any actions. If the spell or ability needs to know information about one or more targets that are now illegal, it will use the illegal targets’ current or last known information.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Aura Blast is a white instant that reads, “Destroy target enchantment. Draw a card.” If the enchantment isn’t a legal target during Aura Blast’s resolution (say, if it has gained protection from white or left play), then Aura Blast is countered. Its controller doesn’t draw a card.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>Plague Spores reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature and target land. They can’t be regenerated.” Suppose the same animated land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plagues Spores isn’t countered because the black creature land is still a legal target for the “target land” part of the spell.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2b The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If you do, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases-read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2c If an effect offers any choices other than choices already made as part of playing the spell or ability, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible. (For example, a player can’t avoid the consequences of not taking an optional action if he or she can’t meet all the immediate requirements of that action.) Drawing a card is never considered an impossible action, even if there are no cards in the affected player's library.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2d Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 103.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2e If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, he or she may play mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to play a spell during resolution, he or she does so by putting that spell on top of the stack, then continuing to play it by following the steps in rules 409.1a-i (except no player receives priority after it’s played). The currently resolving spell or ability then continues to resolve, which may include playing other spells this way. No other spells or abilities can normally be played during resolution.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2f If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures in play), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. The effect uses the current information of a specific permanent if that permanent is still in play, or of a specific card in the stated zone; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information the object had before leaving that zone. There are two exceptions. If an effect deals damage divided among some number of creatures or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put into the stack; see rule 402.6. Also, static abilities can’t use last known information; see rule 412.5. If the ability text states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists (or most recently existed) that does it, not the ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2g An effect that refers to characteristics of an object checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones the object may also have.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An effect that reads “Destroy all black creatures” destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that reads “Destroy all nonblack creatures” doesn’t.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2h A spell is put into play from the stack under the control of the spell’s controller (for permanents) or is put into its owner’s graveyard from the stack (for instants and sorceries) as the final step of the spell’s resolution.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">413.2i If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game has no default for ties.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">414. Countering Spells and Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">414.1. To counter a spell is to move the spell from the stack to its owner’s graveyard. Countering an ability removes it from the stack. Spells and abilities that are countered don’t resolve and none of their effects occur.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">414.2. The player who played the countered spell or ability doesn’t get a “refund” of any costs that were paid.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">415. Targeted Spells and Abilities</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.1. An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if the text that will be followed when it resolves uses the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone. (If an activated or triggered ability of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A sorcery card has the ability “When you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.” This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesn’t make the card it’s on targeted.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.2. An activated or triggered ability is targeted if it uses the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.3. Aura spells are always targeted. An Aura’s target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 502.45, “Enchant”). An Aura permanent doesn’t target anything; only the spell is targeted. An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can be targeted.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Neither Equipment spells nor Equipment permanents target anything. The equip ability is targeted; see rule 502.33, “Equip.” An activated or triggered ability of an Equipment permanent can be targeted.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.4. Spells and abilities that can have zero or more targets are targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for them.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.5. Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability <em class="calibre9">(a)</em> specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player or <em class="calibre9">(b)</em> targets an object that can’t exist in the in-play zone, such as a spell or ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.6. A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.7. Changing Targets</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.7a The target of a spell or ability can change only to another legal target. If the target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.7b Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a spell or ability’s target can’t change its mode.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">415.7c The word “you” in an object’s text isn’t a target.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">416. Effects</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">416.1. When a spell or ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Some effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. State-based effects are not created by spells or abilities; they are generated by specific rules of the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">416.2. Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An effect that changes all lands into creatures won’t alter land cards in players’ graveyards. But an effect that says spells cost more to play will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always on the stack while you are playing it.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">416.3. If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads “Discard two cards” causes him or her to discard only that card. If an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves as many as possible.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">417. One-Shot Effects</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">417.1. A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include damage dealing, destruction of permanents, and moving objects between zones.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">417.2. Some one-shot effects instruct a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than when they resolve. This kind of effect actually creates a new ability that waits to be triggered. (See rule 404.4.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">418. Continuous Effects</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.1. A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects or modifies the rules of the game for a fixed or indefinite period. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability or by a static ability of an object.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.2. Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent coming into play. They don’t wait until the permanent is in play and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent comes into play, apply them before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it comes into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.3. Continuous Effects from Spells or Abilities</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.3a A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as “until end of turn”). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.3b Continuous effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that modify the characteristics or change the controller of one or more objects don’t affect objects that weren’t affected when the continuous effect began. Note that these work differently than continuous effects from static abilities. Continuous effects that don’t modify characteristics or change the controller of objects modify the rules of the game, so they can affect objects that weren’t affected when the continuous effect began.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An effect that reads “All white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turn” gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolves-even if they change color later-and doesn’t affect those that come into play or turn white afterward.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An effect that reads “Prevent all damage creatures would deal this turn” doesn’t modify any object’s characteristics, so it’s modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from creatures that weren’t in play when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later in the turn.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.3c If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 413.2f.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.3d Some effects from activated or triggered abilities have durations worded “as long as . . . .” If the “as long as” duration ends between the end of playing the activated ability or putting the triggered ability onto the stack and the moment when the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Endoskeleton is an artifact with an activated ability that reads “{2}, {T}: Target creature gets +0/+3 as long as Endoskeleton remains tapped.” If you play this ability and then Endoskeleton becomes untapped before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its duration-remaining tapped-was over before the effect began.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.4. Continuous Effects from Static Abilities</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.4a A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn’t “locked in”; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.4b The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is in play or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” generates an effect that continuously gives +1/+1 to each white creature in play. If a creature becomes white, it gets this bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it. A creature spell that would normally create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The creature doesn’t come into play as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.5. Interaction of Continuous Effects</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.5a The values of an object’s characteristics are determined by starting with the actual object, then applying continuous effects in a series of layers in the following order: (1) copy effects (see rule 503, “Copying Objects”); (2) control-changing effects; (3) text-changing effects; (4) type-, subtype-, and supertype-changing effects; (5) all other continuous effects, except those that change power and/or toughness; and (6) power– and/or toughness-changing effects.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Inside each layer from 1 through 5, apply effects from characteristic-setting abilities first, then all other effects. Inside layer 6, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (6a) effects from characteristic-setting abilities; (6b) all other effects not specifically applied in 6c, 6d, or 6e; (6c) changes from counters; (6d) effects from static abilities that modify power and/or toughness but don’t set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; and (6e) effects that switch a creature’s power and toughness. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 418.5b-418.5g).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Crusade is an enchantment that reads “White creatures get +1/+1.” Crusade and a 2/2 black creature are in play. If an effect then turns the creature white, it gets +1/+1 from Crusade, becoming 3/3. If the creature’s color is later changed to red, Crusade’s effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being a 2/2.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is in play. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it, making it 3/3. An effect that says “Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn” is applied to it, making it 7/7. An enchantment that says “Creatures you control get +0/+2” enters play, making it a 7/9. An effect that says “Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn” is applied to it, making it a 1/4 (0/1, plus +1/+1 from the counter, plus +0/+2 from the enchantment).</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is in play. An effect that says “Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that’s still a land” is applied to it. An effect that says “Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn” is applied to it, making it a 4/4 land creature. Then you activate Svogthos’s ability (“Until end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.’ It’s still a land.”) while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard. It becomes a 10/10 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos’s power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a 3/3 land creature again.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.5b If an effect should be applied in different layers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate layers. If an effect starts to apply in one layer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">418.5d An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied, even if this causes a characteristic-setting ability to apply after another effect. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they’re applied in “timestamp order” relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">419. Replacement and Prevention Effects</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1. Replacement and prevention effects are continuous effects that watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. These effects act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1a Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events will be replaced with other events and use the word “skip” to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1b Effects that read “[This permanent] comes into play with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] comes into play . . . ,” or “[This permanent] comes into play as . . . ” are replacement effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1c Continuous effects that read “[This permanent] comes into play . . .” or “[Objects] come into play . . .” are replacement effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1d Effects that use the word “prevent” are prevention effects. Prevention effects use “prevent” to indicate what events will not occur.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.1e Effects that read “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,” are replacement effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.2. Replacement and prevention effects apply continuously as events happen-they aren’t locked in ahead of time.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.3. There are no special restrictions on playing a spell or ability that generates a replacement or prevention effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.4. Replacement or prevention effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs-they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Usually spells and abilities that generate these effects are played in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A player can play a regeneration ability in response to a spell that would destroy a creature he or she controls.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.5. If an event is prevented or replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instruction.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.5a If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won’t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that increase damage dealt have no event to replace, so they have no effect.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.5b Some abilities read, “you may [X]. If you do, [Y].” An “if you do” clause that follows a “you may [X]” clause refers to choosing to do the event X, regardless of what events actually occur as a result of that decision. If X is replaced entirely or in part by a different event, the “if you do” clause refers to the event that replaced X.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6. Replacement Effects</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6a A replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and gets only one opportunity for each event.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that reads “If a creature you control would deal damage to a creature or player, it deals double that damage to that creature or player instead.” A creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damage-not just 4, and not an infinite amount.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6b Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word “instead” doesn’t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage from it, tap it, and (if it’s in combat) remove it from combat.” Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6c Some effects replace damage dealt to one creature or player with the same damage dealt to another creature or player; such effects are called “redirection” effects. If either creature is no longer in play or is no longer a creature when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6d Some spells and abilities replace part or all of their own effect(s) when they resolve. Such effects are called <em class="calibre9">self-replacement effects</em>. When applying replacement effects to an event, apply self-replacement effects first, then apply other replacement effects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6e Skipping an action, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip [something]” is the same as “Instead of doing [something], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped-any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6f Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip his or her next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6g Some replacement effects say “instead choose one -.” Such effects are called <em class="calibre9">modal replacement effects.</em> The mode is chosen as the replacement effect is applied. If a modal replacement effect would apply to multiple events, a different mode may be chosen for each event. A modal replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly, regardless of which mode was chosen. You may not choose modes that are impossible.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.6h Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player's library. If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence. If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.7. Prevention Effects</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.7a Prevention effects usually apply to damage that would be dealt.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.7b Some prevention effects refer to a specific amount of damage-for example, “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn.” These work like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the “shielded” creature or player is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded creature or player by two or more sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the creature chooses which damage the shield prevents first. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesn’t matter.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.7c Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability that generates that effect resolves.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says “{T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it this turn.” When the ability resolves, it gives the target creature and each other creature in play that shares a color with it at that time a shield preventing the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it. Changing creatures’ colors after the ability resolves doesn’t add or remove shields, and creatures that come into play later in the turn don’t get the shield.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.8. Sources of Damage</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.8a Some effects apply to damage from a source-for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.” If an effect requires a player to choose a source, he or she may choose a permanent, a spell on the stack (including an artifact, creature, or enchantment spell), or any card or permanent referred to by an object on the stack (including a creature that assigned combat damage on the stack, even if the creature is no longer in play or is no longer a creature). The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the prevention will apply to the next damage from that permanent, regardless of whether it’s from one of that permanent’s abilities or combat damage dealt by it. If the player chooses an artifact, creature, or enchantment spell, the prevention will apply to any damage from that spell and from the permanent that it becomes when it resolves.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.8b Some effects from spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the “shield” rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn’t used up.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.8c Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t in play that have that property.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.9. Interaction of Replacement or Prevention Effects</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.9a If two or more replacement or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected object’s controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected player chooses one to apply. Then the other effect applies if it is still appropriate. If one or more of the applicable replacement effects is a self-replacement effect (see rule 419.6d), that effect is applied before any other replacement effects. If two or more players have to make these choices at the same time, choices are made in APNAP order (see rule 103.4).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Two permanents are in play. One is an enchantment that reads “If a card would be put into a graveyard, instead remove it from the game,” and the other is a creature that reads “If [this creature] would be put into a graveyard from play, instead shuffle it into its owner’s library.” The controller of the creature that would be destroyed decides which replacement to apply first; the other does nothing.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">419.9b A replacement effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another replacement effect that modifies the event.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> One effect reads “For each 1 life you would gain, instead draw a card,” and another reads “If you would draw a card, return a card from your graveyard to your hand instead.” Both effects combine (regardless of the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player puts a card from his or her graveyard into his or her hand.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">420. State-Based Effects</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.1. State-based effects are a special category that apply only to those conditions listed below. Abilities that watch for a specified game state are triggered abilities, not state-based effects. (See rule 404, “Triggered Abilities.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.2. State-based effects are always active and are not controlled by any player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.3. Whenever a player would get priority (see rule 408, “Timing of Spells and Abilities”), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based effects. All applicable effects resolve as a single event, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based effects have been generated, triggered abilities go on the stack, and then the appropriate player gets priority. This check is also made during the cleanup step (see rule 314); if any of the listed conditions apply, the active player receives priority.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.4. Unlike triggered abilities, state-based effects pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A player controls a creature with the ability “This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand” and plays a spell whose effect is “Discard your hand, then draw seven cards.” The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of the spell’s resolution but will be back up to toughness 7 when the spell finishes resolving. Thus the creature will survive when state-based effects are checked. In contrast, an ability that triggers when the player has no cards in hand goes on the stack after the spell resolves, because its trigger event happened during resolution.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5. The state-based effects are as follows:</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5a A player with 0 or less life loses the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5b A creature with toughness 0 or less is put into its owner’s graveyard. Regeneration can’t replace this event.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5c A creature with lethal damage, but greater than 0 toughness, is destroyed. Lethal damage is an amount of damage greater than or equal to a creature’s toughness. Regeneration can replace this event.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5d An Aura attached to an illegal permanent or player, or not attached to a permanent or player, is put into its owner’s graveyard.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5e If two or more legendary permanents with the same name are in play, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This is called the “legend rule.” If only one of those permanents is legendary, this rule doesn’t apply.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5f A token in a zone other than the in-play zone ceases to exist.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5g A player who attempted to draw a card from an empty library since the last time state-based effects were checked loses the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5h A player with ten or more poison counters loses the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5i If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has been a permanent with the world supertype in play for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners’ graveyards. In the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This is called the “world rule.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5j A copy of a spell in a zone other than the stack ceases to exist. A copy of a card in any zone other than the stack or the in-play zone ceases to exist.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5k An Equipment attached to an illegal permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains in play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5m A non-Aura, non-Equipment permanent attached to another permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains in play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">420.5n If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">421. Handling “Infinite” Loops</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">421.1. Occasionally the game can get into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated forever. These rules (sometimes called the “infinity rules”) govern how to break such loops.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">421.2. If the loop contains one or more optional actions and one player controls them all, that player chooses a number. The loop is treated as repeating that many times or until another player intervenes, whichever comes first.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">421.3. If a loop contains optional actions controlled by two players and actions by both of those players are required to continue the loop, the first player (or the first involved player after the active player in turn order) chooses a number. The other player then has two choices. He or she can choose a lower number, in which case the loop continues that number of times plus whatever fraction is necessary for the active player to “have the last word.” Or he or she can agree to the number the first player chose, in which case the loop continues that number of times plus whatever fraction is necessary for the second player to “have the last word.” (Note that either fraction may be zero.) This sequence of choices is extended to all applicable players if there are more than two players involved.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a two-player game, one player controls a creature with the ability “{0}: [This creature] gains flying,” and another player controls a permanent with the ability “{0}: Target creature loses flying.” The “infinity rule” ensures that regardless of which player initiated the gain/lose flying ability, the nonactive player will always have the final choice and therefore be able to determine whether the creature has flying. (Note that this assumes that the first player attempted to give the creature flying at least once.)</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">421.4. If the loop contains only mandatory actions, the game ends in a draw. (See rule 102.4b.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">421.5. If the loop contains optional actions controlled by different players and these actions don’t depend on one another, the active player chooses a number. In APNAP order, the nonactive players can each either agree to that number or choose a higher number. Note that this rule applies even if the actions could exist in separate loops rather than in a single loop.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">422. Handling Illegal Actions</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">422.1. If a player realizes that he or she can’t legally take an action after starting to do so, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was playing a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. The player may also reverse any legal mana abilities played while making the illegal play, unless mana from them or from any triggered mana abilities they triggered was spent on another mana ability that wasn’t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library or from a library to any zone other than the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">422.2. When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">423. Drawing a Card</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of his or her library into his or her hand. This is done as a game action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.2a If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards, the active player performs all of his or her draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">432.2b If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a Two-Headed Giant game, first the primary player (seated on the right) on the active team performs all of his or her draws, then the secondary player on that team performs all of his or her draws, then the nonactive team does the same.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.3. If there are no cards in a player’s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player may choose to do so. See rule 413.2c.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from an empty library loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5g.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.5. If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards or that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.6. Some effects replace card draws.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.6a An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s library.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.6b If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">423.6c Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it’s drawn. If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any subsequent replacement effects.</div>

        5. Additional Rules <br class="calibre8"/>
      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">500. Legal Attacks and Blocks</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">500.1. Some effects restrict declaring attackers or blockers in combat or require certain creatures to be declared as attackers or blockers. (See rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step,” and rule 309, “Declare Blockers Step.”) A <em class="calibre9">restriction</em> is an effect that says a creature can’t block (or attack) or it can’t block (or attack) unless some condition is met. A <em class="calibre9">requirement</em> is an effect that says a creature must block (or attack) or it must block (or attack) if some condition is met.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">500.2. As part of declaring attackers, the active player checks each creature he or she controls to see whether it must attack, can’t attack, or has some other attacking restriction or requirement. If such a restriction or requirement conflicts with the proposed attack, the attack is illegal, and the active player must then propose another set of attacking creatures. (Tapped creatures and creatures with unpaid costs to attack are exempt from effects that would require them to attack.)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states “[This creature] can’t attack alone.” It’s legal to declare both as attackers.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A player controls two creatures: one that “attacks if able” and one with no abilities. An effect states, “No more than one creature may attack each turn.” The only legal attack is for just the creature that “attacks if able” to attack. It’s illegal to attack with the other creature, attack with both, or attack with neither.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">500.3. As part of declaring blockers, the defending player checks each creature he or she controls to see whether it must block, can’t block, or has some other blocking restriction or requirement. If such a restriction or requirement conflicts with the proposed set of blocking creatures, the block is illegal, and the defending player must then propose another set of blocking creatures.

      <div class="paragraph">502.18b Although the cycling ability is playable only if the card is in a player’s hand, it continues to exist while the object is in play and in all other zones.

The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. “Madness [cost]” means “If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but may remove it from the game instead of putting it into his or her graveyard” and “When this card is removed from the game this way, its owner may play it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn't, he or she puts this card into his or her graveyard.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">502.26a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. “Morph [cost]” means “You may play this card as a 2/2 face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than its mana cost.” Any time you could play an instant, you may show all players the morph cost for any face-down permanent you control, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. This action does not use the stack. (See rule 504, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">502.26b To play a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 503, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use morph to play a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it comes into play with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">502.26c You can’t play a card face down if it doesn’t have morph.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">502.26d Any time you could play an instant, you may turn a face-down permanent you control face up. To do this, show all players what the permanent’s morph cost will be when the effect ends, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent coming into play don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already come into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">502.26e If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 503, “Copying Objects.”) The rules for morph and face-down permanents apply to it normally.</div>

Instead of proceeding to end of combat, the phase gets a second combat damage step to handle the remaining creatures. In the second combat damage step, surviving attackers and blockers that didn’t assign combat damage in the first step, plus any creatures with double strike, assign their combat damage.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">503.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object’s characteristics (name, mana cost, color, type, supertype, subtype, expansion symbol, rules text, power, and toughness) and, for an object on the stack, choices made when playing it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether a kicker cost was paid, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The “copiable values” are the values that are printed on the object, as modified by other copy effects, “comes into play as” abilities, and abilities that caused the object to be face down. Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, and counters are not copied.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads “{X}: Chimeric Staff becomes an X/X artifact creature until end of turn.” Clone is a creature that reads, “As Clone comes into play, you may choose a creature in play. If you do, Clone comes into play as a copy of that creature.” After a Staff has become a 5/5 artifact creature, a Clone comes into play as a copy of it. The Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature. (The copy has the Staff’s ability, however, and will become a creature if that ability is activated.)</em>

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.3. The copy’s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copy’s status. Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.4. Some effects cause a permanent that’s copying a permanent to copy a different permanent while remaining in play.

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.5. An object that comes into play “as a copy” of another permanent becomes a copy as it comes into play. It doesn’t come into play, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text that’s being copied includes any abilities that replace the comes-into-play event (such as “comes into play with” or “as [this] comes into play” abilities), those abilities will take effect.

        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Striped Bears reads, “When Striped Bears comes into play, draw a card.” A Clone comes into play as a copy of Striped Bears. The Clone has the Bears’ comes-into-play triggered ability, so the Clone’s controller draws a card.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.6. When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent aren’t copied. Instead, if an object comes into play as a copy of another permanent, the object’s controller will get to make any “as comes into play” choices for it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A Clone comes into play as a copy of Chameleon Spirit. Chameleon Spirit reads, in part, “As Chameleon Spirit comes into play, choose a color.” The Clone won’t copy the color choice of the Spirit; rather, the controller of the Clone will get to make a new choice.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.7. Because any choices that have been made for a permanent aren’t copied, sometimes a copy card will gain an ability that refers to a choice that was never made. In that case, the choice is considered to be “zero” or “undefined.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Voice of All comes into play and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in part, “As Voice of All comes into play, choose a color. / Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” Unstable Shapeshifter never got a chance to choose a color, because it didn’t come into play as a Voice of All card, so the Shapeshifter’s protection ability doesn’t protect it from anything at all.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.8. If an ability causes a player to make a choice as a copy comes into play, the copy will “remember” that choice and continue to use it for its abilities if appropriate. If the choice is not appropriate, it is considered to be “zero” or “undefined.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A Vesuvan Doppelganger comes into play as a copy of Chameleon Spirit, and the Doppelganger’s controller chooses blue.

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.9. Some copy effects give an ability to the copy as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied. Also, some copy effects specifically state that they don’t copy certain characteristics; they retain their original values instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Quirion Elves comes into play and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability “Whenever a creature comes into play, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.” Then a Clone comes into play as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.10. To copy a spell means to put a copy of the spell onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn’t “played.” In addition to copying the characteristics of the spell, all decisions made when the spell was played are copied. These include mode, targets, the value of X, and optional additional costs such as buyback. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell. A copy of a spell is controlled by the player who put it on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, but it has no spell card associated with it. It works just like a normal spell: it can be countered or it can resolve, and it uses the same timing rules as normal spells.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">

The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Fling is an instant that reads, “As an additional cost to play Fling, sacrifice a creature. / Fling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature’s power to target creature or player.” When determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.</em>

      <div class="paragraph">503.10a A copy of a spell in a zone other than the stack ceases to exist. A copy of a card in any zone other than the stack or the in-play zone ceases to exist. This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">503.12. An effect that instructs a player to “play a copy” of an object follows the rules for playing spells and abilities, except that the copy is played while another spell or ability is resolving. Playing a copy of a nonland object follows steps 409.1a-409.1h of rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities," then the copy becomes played. The played copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">504. Face-Down Spells and Permanents</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.1. Two cards (Illusionary Mask and Ixidron) and the morph ability (see rule 502.26) allow spells and permanents to be face down.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.2. Face-down spells on the stack, face-down permanents in play, and face-down cards in the phased-out zone have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the card, spell, or permanent to be turned face down. Any listed characteristics are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 503, “Copying Objects.”) Objects that are put into play face down are turned face down before they come into play, so the permanent’s comes-into-play abilities won’t trigger (if triggered) or have any effect (if static). Objects that are played face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spell’s characteristics.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.3. At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack, a face-down permanent you control, or a face-down card in the phased-out zone you controlled when it phased out. You can’t look at face-down cards in any other zone, face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player, or face-down cards in the phased-out zone last controlled by another player. The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanent’s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally can’t be turned face up.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.4. If you control multiple face-down spells on the stack or face-down permanents in play, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing the order spells were played, the order that face-down permanents came into play, which creature attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.5. As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values. Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any abilities relating to the permanent coming into play don’t trigger and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already come into play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.6. If a face-down permanent moves from the in-play zone to any zone other than the phased-out zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as he or she moves it. If a phased-out face-down object moves to any zone other than the in-play zone, its owner must reveal it as he or she moves it. If a face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the in-play zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as he or she moves it. At the end of each game, all face-down objects in play, in the phased-out zone, or on the stack must be revealed to all players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.7. If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status. Its characteristics therefore remain the same: the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be turned face down. However, if it is turned face up, its copiable values become the values it copied from the other permanent.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">504.8. If a face-down permanent would have an “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . .” ability after it’s turned face up, that ability is applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">505. Split Cards</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.1. Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal <strong class="calibre11">Magic: The Gathering </strong>card back.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.2. In every zone except the stack, split cards have two sets of characteristics and two converted mana costs. As long as a split card is a spell on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being played exist. The other half’s characteristics are treated as though they didn’t exist.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.3. Because every split card consists of two halves with different colored mana symbols in their mana costs, each split card is a multicolored card while it’s not a spell on the stack. While it’s a spell on the stack, it’s only the color or colors of the half being played.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.4. Although split cards have two playable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.5. An effect that asks for a particular characteristic of a split card while it’s in a zone other than the stack gets two answers (one for each of the split card’s two halves).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Infernal Genesis has an ability that reads, “At the beginning of each player’s upkeep, that player puts the top card from his or her library into his or her graveyard. He or she then puts X 1/1 black Minion creature tokens into play, where X is that card’s converted mana cost.” If the top card of your library is Assault/Battery when this ability resolves, the game sees its converted mana cost as “1, and 4.” You get five creature tokens.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.6. An effect that performs a positive comparison (such as asking if a card is red) or a relative comparison (such as asking if a card’s converted mana cost is less than 2) involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if either side of each split card in the comparison would return a “yes” answer if compared individually.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect that performs a negative comparison (such as asking if cards have different names) involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack also gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if performing the comparable positive comparison would return a “no” answer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If an effect performs a comparison involving multiple characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack, each characteristic is compared separately. If each of the individual comparisons would return a “yes” answer, the whole comparison returns a “yes” answer.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Void reads, “Choose a number. Destroy all artifacts and creatures with converted mana cost equal to that number. Then target player reveals his or her hand and discards all nonland cards with converted mana cost equal to the number.” If a player plays Void and chooses 1, his or her opponent would discard Assault/Battery because the game sees its converted mana cost as “1, and 4.” The same is true if the player chooses 4. If the player chooses 5, however, Assault/Battery would be unaffected.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">505.7. If an effect instructs a player to name a card and the player wants to name a split card, the player must name both halves of the split card.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">506. Subgames</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.1. Some cards allow players to play a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> subgame. A “subgame” is the game created by the card’s effect. The “main game” is the game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was played. The main game is temporarily discontinued while the subgame is in progress. It resumes when the subgame ends.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.2. Any main-game abilities that trigger while the subgame is in progress aren’t put onto the stack until the subgame is completed.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.3. To start the subgame, each player removes his or her library from the game face down. It becomes that player’s deck in the subgame. Abilities that trigger on cards being removed from the main game face down will trigger.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.3a A player’s deck in the subgame may have less than the minimum number of cards. If a player’s deck contains less than seven cards, the player will lose the game as soon as it starts, even if he or she mulligans. (See rule 420, “State-Based Effects.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.4. The subgame proceeds like a normal game. Randomly determine which player goes first.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.5. All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are considered outside the subgame (except those specifically brought into the subgame). All players not currently in the subgame are considered outside the subgame.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.5a Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it. Cards brought into a subgame from a main game are considered to be removed from the main game. Abilities in the main game that trigger on objects being removed from the main game will trigger.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.6. At the end of a subgame, each player puts all objects he or she owns that were brought into the subgame into his or her library in the main game, then shuffles that library. Cards removed from the game in the subgame are not put into the player’s main-game library. Instead they remain removed from the game in the main game.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If a card was brought into the subgame either from the main game or from outside the main game, that card will be put into its owner’s main-game library when the subgame ends.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">506.7. If another subgame is created during a subgame, there can be multiple subgames and main games. Each main game has one subgame, and each subgame has one main game. In this case, some games will be considered both a main game and a subgame at the same time.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">507. Controlling Another Player’s Turn</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.1. One card (Mindslaver) allows a player’s turn to be controlled by another player. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes. The entire turn is controlled; the effect doesn’t end until the beginning of the next turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.1a Multiple turn-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.1b If a turn is skipped, any pending turn-controlling effects wait until the player who would be affected actually takes a turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.1c Only the control of the turn changes. All objects are controlled by their normal controllers.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.2. If information about an object would be visible to the player whose turn is controlled, it’s visible to both that player and the controller of the turn.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> The controller of a player’s turn can see that player’s hand and the identity of any face-down creatures he or she controls.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.3. The controller of another player’s turn makes all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.3b The controller of another player’s turn can’t make that player concede. A player may concede the game at any time, even if his or her turn is controlled by another player. See rule 102.3a.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">507.3c The controller of another player’s turn can’t make choices or decisions for that player that aren’t called for by the rules or by any objects.

      <div class="paragraph">507.4. A player doesn’t lose life due to mana burn while another player controls his or her turn. (Unused mana in players’ mana pools is still lost when a phase ends. See rule 300.3.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">508. Flip Cards</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.1. Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card’s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal <strong class="calibre11">Magic: The Gathering</strong> card back.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.1a The top half of a flip card contains the card’s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to “flip” if certain conditions are met.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.1b The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is in play and only if the permanent is flipped.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.1c A flip card’s color, mana cost, expansion symbol, illustration credit, and legal text don’t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.2. In every zone other than the in-play zone, and also in the in-play zone before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the permanent. Once the flip permanent in the in-play zone is flipped, the normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness of the flip permanent don’t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a legendary creature named Tok-Tok, Volcano Born. An effect that says “search for library for a legendary card” can’t find this flip card. An effect that says “legendary creatures get +2/+2” doesn’t affect Akki Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.3. If you control a flip permanent, you must ensure that it’s clear at all times whether the permanent is flipped or not, both when it’s untapped and when it’s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">508.4. Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it’s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves play, it retains no memory of its status.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">509. Ending the Turn</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.1. One card (Time Stop) ends the turn when it resolves. When an effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order, as they differ from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 413, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.1a Remove every object on the stack from the game. Remove all attacking and blocking creatures, if any, from combat. All objects not in play or on the stack that aren’t represented by cards will cease to exist the next time state-based effects are checked (see rule 420, “State-Based Effects).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.1b Check state-based effects. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.1c The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. Skip any phases or steps between this phase or step and the cleanup step.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.2. No player gets priority during this process, so triggered abilities are not put onto the stack. If any triggered abilities have triggered between the spell or ability resolving and the cleanup step ending, there’s a chance to play spells and abilities in the cleanup step. Then there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends (see rule 314.3).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">509.3. Even though the turn ends, “at end of turn” triggered abilities don’t trigger because the end of turn step is skipped.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">510. Status</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.1. A permanent’s “status” is its physical state. There are three status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, and face up/face down. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.2. Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.3. Permanents come into play untapped, unflipped, and face up unless a spell or ability says otherwise.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.4. A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or game action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Dimir Doppelganger says “{1}{U}{B}: Remove target creature card in a graveyard from the game. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card. Through use of Jushi Apprentice’s ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will retain its flipped status even though that has no relevance to Grizzly Bears. If its copy ability is activated again, this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent’s flipped status means it will have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir Doppelganger ability.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.5. Only permanents have status. Cards not in play do not. Although a card in the removed-from-the-game zone may be face down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">510.6. A permanent that phases out remembers its status, as well as other information about the permanent (such as who controls it or whether it has any counters on it). It will phase in with the same status it had when it phased out. If it was face down when it phased out, it will stay face down in the phased-out zone.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">511. Flipping a Coin</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">511.1. To flip a coin for an object that cares whether a player wins or loses the flip, the affected player flips the coin and calls “heads” or “tails.” If the call matches the result, that player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">511.2. To flip a coin for an object that cares whether the coin comes up heads or tails, each affected player flips a coin without making a call. No player wins or loses this kind of flip.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">511.3. If the coin that’s being flipped doesn’t have an obvious “heads” or “tails,” designate one side to be “heads,” and the other side to be “tails.” Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call “odds” or “evens,” or roll an even-sided die and designate that “odds” means “heads” and “evens” means “tails.”</div>

      </h1>
      <h5 class="subtitle">600. General</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">600.1. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">600.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">600.3. Many multiplayer <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current <strong class="calibre11">Magic: The Gathering</strong> DCI Floor Rules for more information. They can be found at <del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home</strong></del>.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">600.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">600.4a. When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 200.8) owned by that player leave the game, all spells and abilities controlled by that player on the stack cease to exist, and any change-of-control effects which give that player control of any objects end. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects leave the game. (Any objects leaving the game this way that aren’t owned by the player leaving the game are placed in the removed-from-the-game zone.) This is not a state-based effect. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. A player leaving the game doesn’t affect combat damage on the stack.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Alex plays Control Magic, an Aura that reads, “You control enchanted creature,” on Bianca’s Wall of Wood.

      <h5 class="subtitle">601. Limited Range of Influence Option</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 607), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.2. A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, and making choices.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.2a The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to your right are within your range of influence.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.2b A player is always within his or her own range of influence.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.2c The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex’s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter Alex’s range of influence at the start of the next turn.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.2d An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player controls can’t attack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.4. Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.5a If a player is asked to choose an object or player, he or she must choose one within his or her range of influence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, “Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to target creature or player and 1 damage to target creature or player of an opponent’s choice,” targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target that’s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.5b If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), he or she can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player’s range of influence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex plays a card that reads, “An opponent chooses one – You draw 2 cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,” and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.5c If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor plays Fact or Fiction, which reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” Since no opponent is within the emperor’s range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor’s left separates the cards into piles.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.6. A player can’t play the activated abilities of an object outside of his or her range of influence.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.7. A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source’s controller.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a game with range of influence limited to 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex’s Grizzly Bears: One with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked,” and one with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature.” Alex’s Grizzly Bears attacks the player to Alex’s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob’s first Aura triggers because the entire event (Grizzly Bears becomes blocked) happens within Rob’s range of influence. The ability of Rob’s second Aura doesn’t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking creature, which is out of Rob’s range.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.7a If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rule 410.10.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Carissa and Alex are outside each other’s range of influence. Carissa controls a creature owned by Alex and they each control a Soul Net, an artifact which reads, “Whenever a creature is put into a graveyard from play, you may pay {1}. If you do, you gain 1 life.” The creature is destroyed and is put into Alex’s graveyard. Alex’s Soul Net doesn’t trigger because the destruction event was outside Alex’s range of influence. Carissa’s Soul Net does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the destruction event was within her range.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.8. An Aura can’t enchant an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal permanent, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based effect. See rule 420.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.9. An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains in play. This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.10. Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex plays Pyroclasm, which reads, “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, “Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature in play that shares a creature type with it.” Coat of Arms will boost Alex’s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. It won’t take other creatures into account.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex.

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.12. The “legend rule” (see rule 420.5e) applies to a permanent only if other legendary permanents with the same name are within its controller’s range of influence.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>Alex has range of influence 1, and Carissa has range of influence 2. Rob sits between them.

      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.13. The “world rule” (see rule 420.5i) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller’s range of influence.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.14. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule 419, “Replacement and Prevention Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.14a If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Alex plays Lava Axe (“Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player”) targeting Rob.

Carissa isn’t in Alex’s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals only 2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">601.14b If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a creature or player, it can affect only creatures and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">602. Attack Multiple Players Option</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">602.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">602.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn’t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking player’s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">602.2a Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. This will usually be the defending player that the creature with the ability is attacking; if there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the ability chooses one.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">602.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, he or she chooses a defending player for it to attack. See rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">602.3a Restrictions and requirements that don’t apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on the entire group of attacking creatures.

      <div class="paragraph">606.4. The Two-Headed Giant variant has two unique features.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.4a Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 40 life.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">606.4b. Each team takes turns rather than each player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.5. With the exception of life total, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6a A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may mulligan. First, the starting team takes any mulligans. For a team to take a mulligan, each player on that team decides whether to shuffle his or her hand back into the deck and then draw a new hand of seven cards. All players on that team who chose to do so take their mulligans at the same time. After each player on that team who took a mulligan looks at his or her new hand, the team repeats the process, resulting in a hand of one fewer card each time, until the hand size reaches zero cards. Teammates may consult during this process, but a player can’t see the result of his or her teammate’s mulligan before deciding whether to take a mulligan at the same time. Once a player has decided to keep a hand, those cards become his or her opening hand. That player can’t take any more mulligans, but his or her teammate may. Once each player on the starting team decides to keep an opening hand, the other team may take mulligans.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6b. During the draw step of the starting team’s first turn, only the secondary player draws a card. The primary player does not (see rule 101.5).</div>

      <div class="paragraph">606.6c Teams have priority, not individual players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6d The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 103.4) is modified for Two-Headed Giant play. The team whose turn it is is the active team.

      <div class="paragraph">606.6e A player may play a spell or activated ability, or take a special action, only when his or her team has priority. If both players on a team want to take an action at the same time, the primary player decides who takes the action. Each player on a team draws a card during that team’s draw step. Each player on a team may play a land during each of that team’s turns.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6f If neither player on a team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If both teams pass in succession (that is, if both teams pass without any player taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty when both teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6g If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that player’s turn, that player’s team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that player’s team does so. If an effect causes a player to control another player’s turn, the controller of that effect controls the affected player’s team’s turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.6h If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a Two-Headed Giant game, first the primary player on the active team performs all of his or her draws, then the secondary player on that team performs all of his or her draws, then the nonactive team does the same.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.7. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses different combat rules than other multiplayer variants.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.7a Each team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the <em class="calibre9">attacking team</em> and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the <em class="calibre9">defending team</em> and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.7b. As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. If a creature is unable to attack one of the defending players, that creature can’t attack the defending team. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> One player in a Two-Headed Giant game controls Teferi’s Moat, which says “As Teferi’s Moat comes into play, choose a color. / Creatures of the chosen color without flying can’t attack you.” Creatures of the chosen color without flying can’t attack that player’s team.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.7c As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block any attacking creatures. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example: </strong>If an attacking creature has forestwalk and either player on the defending team controls a Forest, the creature can’t be blocked.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.7d As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. If an attacking creature would assign combat damage to the defending team, the active team chooses only one of the defending players for that creature to assign its combat damage to. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 102), with the following additions.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.8a If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game the next time a team would receive priority. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606. 8b Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect would prevent a player from winning the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect would prevent a player from losing the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.</div>

          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player plays Flame Rift, which reads, “Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player.” Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.9a If an effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that effect uses the team’s life total divided by two, rounded up, instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a team is at 17 life when a player activates Heartless Hidetsugu’s ability, which reads, “Heartless Hidetsugu deals to each player damage equal to half that player’s life total, rounded down.” For the purposes of this ability, each player on that team is considered to be at 9 life. Heartless Hidetsugu deals 4 damage to each of those players, for a total of 8 damage. The team will end up at 9 life.</em>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.” At the beginning of your upkeep, the player’s team wins the game only if his or her share of the team’s life total is 50 or more.

The opposing team’s life total must be 20 or less for that to happen.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.9b If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, the result is the sum of all the numbers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player plays Biorhythm, which reads, “Each player’s life total becomes the number of creatures he or she controls.” If one member of a team controls three creatures and the other member controls four creatures, that team’s life total becomes 7.</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.9c If an effect would set a single player’s life total to a number, that player’s individual life total becomes that number. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount that player's life total was adjusted.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life plays a spell that reads, “Your life total becomes 20.” That player’s life total is considered to be 13 for the purpose of the spell, so it becomes 20 and the team’s life total becomes 32 (25 + (20 – 13)).</em>
      </div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">606.10. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players.

      <h5 class="subtitle">607. Emperor Variant</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">607.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">607.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which it’s seated.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">607.7 In the Emperor variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">608. Grand Melee Variant</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.2a Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 601).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.2b The attack left option is used (see rule 604).</div>

      <div class="paragraph">608.2c The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren’t used in the Grand Melee variant.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.3. The players are seated at random.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving <em class="calibre9">turn markers </em>keep track of which players are currently taking turns<em class="calibre9">.</em> Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">608.4a There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ability” and “effect” are often confused with one another. An instruction in an object’s text is an ability. The result of following such an instruction is an effect. For more information, see section 4, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When an activated ability is played, it goes onto the stack and stays there until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When an effect states that an object “gains” or “has” an ability, it’s granting that object an ability. If an effect defines a property of an object (“[card or permanent] is [property]”), it’s not granting an ability. For example, an Aura might read, “Enchanted creature is red.” The Aura isn’t granting an ability of any kind; it’s simply changing the enchanted creature’s color to red.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Ability Word</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities on cards. Ability words are similar to keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Activated Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An activated ability is written as “activation cost: effect.” By paying the activation cost, a player may play such an ability whenever he or she has priority. See rule 403, “Activated Abilities.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Activation Cost</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The activation cost of an activated ability is everything before the colon in “activation cost: effect.” It must be paid to play the ability. See rule 403, “Activated Abilities.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Active Player</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The active player is the player whose turn it is. The active player gets priority at the start of each phase or step (except for the untap and cleanup steps), after any spell or ability (except a mana ability) resolves, and after combat damage resolves. See rule 200.3.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Active Player, Nonactive Player Order</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Whenever players are instructed to make choices at the same time, the active player makes all his or her choices first, then the nonactive players do so in turn order. This is called the “Active Player, Nonactive Player order” rule, or “APNAP order” rule. See rule 103.4. This rule is modified for Two-Headed Giant play; see rule 606.6d.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Additional Cost</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some spells have additional costs listed in their text. These are paid at the same time the player pays the spell’s mana cost. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Affinity</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. “Affinity for [text]” means “This spell costs you {1} less to play for each [text] you control.” The affinity ability reduces only generic mana costs. It doesn’t reduce how much colored mana you have to pay for a spell. It can’t reduce the cost to play a spell to less than 0. See rule 502.31, “Affinity.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Alternative Cost</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The rules text of some spells reads, “You may [action] rather than pay [this object’s] mana cost,” or includes the phrase, “you may play [this object] without paying its mana cost.” These are alternative costs. Only one such alternative cost can be applied to any one spell. Other spells and abilities that ask for a spell’s mana cost still see the actual mana cost, not what was paid to play the spell. If an effect requires paying additional costs to play a spell, it still applies to the alternative cost. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Amplify</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Amplify is a static ability. “Amplify N” means “As this object comes into play, reveal any number of cards from your hand that share a creature type with it. This permanent comes into play with N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You can’t reveal this card or any other cards that are coming into play at the same time as this card.” See rule 502.27, “Amplify.”</div>

Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under DCI tournament rules. When using the ante rule, each player puts one random card from his or her deck into his or her ante zone at the beginning of the game. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of the cards in each player’s ante zone. See rule 217.9, “Ante.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">An artifact land is a combination of artifact and land, and it’s subject to the rules for both. (See rule 212.2, “Artifacts.”) Artifact lands can only be played as lands. They can’t be played as spells. Some artifact lands don’t have a land type. Those that do will say “Artifact Land – [land type].”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Artifact Type</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Artifact – Equipment.” Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. However, if an artifact creature card has subtypes printed on its type line, those subtypes are creature types. If an artifact land card has subtypes printed on its type line, those types are land types.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The list of artifact types, updated through the <em class="calibre9">Time Spiral</em> set, is as follows: Equipment.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">“As though”</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Text that states a player may do something “as though” some condition were true or a creature can do something “as though” some condition were true applies only to the stated action. For purposes of that action, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> Giant Spider reads, “Giant Spider can block as though it had flying.” Treat the Spider as a creature with flying, but only for the purpose of declaring blockers. This allows Giant Spider to block a creature with flying (and creatures that “can’t be blocked except by creatures with flying”), assuming no other blocking restrictions apply. For example, Giant Spider can’t normally block a creature with both flying and shadow.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">If two cards state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing “as though” different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one “as though” effect satisfies the requirements for another “as though” effect, then both effects will apply.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Assign Combat Damage</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">As the combat damage step begins, the active player or team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. Then the defending player(s) announce how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage. All assignments of combat damage go on the stack as a single entry. See rule 310, “Combat Damage Step.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attach</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To attach an Aura or Equipment to a permanent means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that permanent. If the Aura or Equipment no longer exists or the object it will move onto is no longer in the correct zone when the effect would attach it, nothing happens. Similarly, an Aura or Equipment can’t be attached to a permanent it couldn’t enchant or equip. The Aura or Equipment stays where it is, with one exception: If an Aura is coming into play from the stack and there is no legal permanent for it to enchant, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of coming into play. If an effect tries to attach an Aura or Equipment to the permanent it’s already attached to, the effect does nothing.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Attaching an Aura in play to a different permanent causes the Aura to receive a new timestamp. Nothing else about the Aura changes. The Aura never left play, so no comes-into-play or leaves-play triggered abilities will trigger. If an ability of the moved Aura affecting “enchanted [permanent]” was on the stack when the Aura moved, it will affect the new enchanted permanent when it resolves, not the old one. The same is true for moved Equipment.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attack</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A creature attacks when it’s declared as an attacker during the combat phase. (See rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step.”) Playing a spell or ability (even during the combat phase) is never considered to be an attack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attack Alone</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A creature is attacking alone when it’s the only creature declared as an attacker in a given combat phase. See rule 306.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attack Left Option</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some multiplayer games use the optional “attack left” rules. If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to his or her left. If a player’s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack. See rule 604, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attack Multiple Players Option</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple opponents. Each of the attacked players is a defending player. Each defending player can block only the creatures attacking him or her. See rule 602, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Attack Right Option</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some multiplayer games use the optional “attack right” rules. If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to his or her right. If a player’s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack. See rule 604, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options.”</div>

It remains an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat, it stops being a creature, its controller changes, or the combat phase ends. Attacking creatures don’t exist outside of the combat phase. See rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Aura</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura spell requires a target whose properties are indicated by its enchant keyword ability. An Aura permanent comes into play attached to the permanent or player the spell targeted. See rule 212.4, “Enchantments,” and rule 502.45, “Enchant.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An Aura can enchant only a permanent or player whose properties are indicated by its enchant keyword ability. An Aura attached to an illegal permanent or not attached to a permanent is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Banding, “Bands with Other”</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for declaring attackers and assigning combat damage. “Bands with other” is a specialized version of the ability. See rule 502.10, “Banding,” and rule 502.11, “Bands with Other.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Basic</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Basic is a supertype. Any land with the supertype basic is a basic land. Any land without that supertype is a nonbasic land. See rule 205.4, “Supertypes.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Basic Land Type</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There are five basic land types: Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. Every basic land type has a mana ability associated with it. (See rule 212.6, “Lands.”)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Becomes</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes tapped” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens-they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. For example, “becomes tapped” triggers only when a permanent’s status changes from untapped to tapped.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Counter has two meanings in the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">1. To counter a spell or ability is to cancel it, removing it from the stack. It doesn’t resolve and none of its effects occur. A countered spell is put into its owner’s graveyard. See rule 414, “Countering Spells and Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">2. A counter is a marker placed on an object, either modifying its characteristics or interacting with an effect. A +X/+Y counter on a permanent, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that permanent’s power and Y to that permanent’s toughness. These bonuses are added after permanent-type changing effects and after most other power and toughness changing effects. Similarly, -X/-Y counters subtract from power and toughness. See rule 418.5a. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable. Counters may also be given to players. For information about poison counters, see rule 102.3d.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it. This is a state-based effect; see rule 420.5n.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Counts As (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with text stating that the card “counts as” something. As far as the game rules and other cards are concerned, the card is that thing. (Newer <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> cards use “is” instead.)</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Creature</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Creature is a type. The active player may play creatures during his or her main phase when the stack is empty. When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it into play under his or her control. See rule 212.3, “Creatures.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Creature Type</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Creature – Human Soldier,” “Artifact Creature – Golem,” and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The list of creature types, updated through the<em class="calibre9"> Time Spiral </em>set, is as follows:</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Cumulative Upkeep</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. “Cumulative upkeep [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent, then sacrifice this permanent unless you pay [cost] for each age counter on it.” If [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none of them are paid. Partial payments aren’t allowed. Note that if a permanent has more than one instance of cumulative upkeep, each creates a separate triggered ability at the beginning of upkeep that counts all the age counters on the permanent from all abilities. See rule 502.13, “Cumulative Upkeep.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Cycling</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a player’s hand. “Cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.” See rule 502.18, “Cycling.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Damage</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Damage can be dealt to creatures and/or players.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Damage dealt to a player is subtracted from his or her life total.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Damage dealt to a creature stays on the permanent until end of turn, even if it stops being a creature. A creature with damage greater than or equal to its toughness has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed. (See rule 420, “State-Based Effects.”) Damage doesn’t alter a creature’s toughness. A noncreature permanent isn’t affected by damage (but if it becomes a creature again before the damage is removed, the creature may be destroyed). During the cleanup step, all damage is removed from permanents.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Costs and effects that read “lose life” or “pay life” don’t deal damage, and that loss of life can’t be prevented or otherwise altered by effects that prevent or replace damage.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Deck</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A player’s deck is the collection of cards that player starts the game with. When the game begins, each player’s deck becomes his or her library. See section 100, “General,” and section 101, “Starting the Game.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Declare Attackers</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To declare attackers, the active player chooses a set of creatures that will attack and pays any costs they require to attack. Only creatures can attack, and the following creatures can’t attack: tapped creatures (even those that can attack without tapping) and creatures the active player didn’t control continuously since the beginning of the turn (except those with haste). Other effects may also affect whether or not a set of creatures could attack. See rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Declare Attackers Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The declare attackers step is the second step of the combat phase. The active player declares attackers during this step (or chooses not to attack). Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities. See rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Declare Blockers</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To declare blockers, the defending player chooses a set of creatures that will block and pays any costs they require to block. Only untapped creatures can block, but blocking doesn’t cause creatures to tap. Other effects may also affect whether or not a set of creatures could block. See rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Declare Blockers Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The declare blockers step is the third step of the combat phase. The defending player declares blockers during this step (or chooses not to block). Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities. See rule 309, “Declare Blockers Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Defender</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Defender is a static ability. Creatures with defender can’t attack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Defending Player</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">During the combat phase, the active player is attacking and is the attacking player. As the combat phase starts, the active player chooses one opponent. The chosen opponent is being attacked and is the defending player. Creatures can attack only the defending player; they can’t attack other creatures. During phases other than combat, there is no defending player. See rule 306.3.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If the “attack multiple players” option is used in a multiplayer game, there can be more than one defending player. See rule 602, “Attack Multiple Players Option.” The Two-Headed Giant variant uses different combat rules than other multiplayer variants; see rule 606.7.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Delayed Triggered Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A delayed triggered ability is created by effects generated when some spells or abilities resolve. See rule 404.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Depend On</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect is said to “depend on” another if it is applied at the same time as the other effect and applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to. See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Deploy Creatures Option</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some multiplayer games allow players to give creatures to their teammates. If the deploy creatures option is used, each creature has the ability “{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery.” See rule 603, “Deploy Creatures Option.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Destroy</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To destroy a permanent is to move it from the in-play zone to its owner’s graveyard. Regeneration or other destruction-replacement effects can replace this action. See rule 419, “Replacement and Prevention Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Discard</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A player discards a card by putting a card from his or her hand into his or her graveyard. By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose which card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card is discarded.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Distribute</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Distribute has its normal English meaning in the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game. If a spell or ability requires a player to distribute something (such as counters) as he or she chooses among one or more targets, or among any number of untargeted objects or players, then each of these targets, objects, or players must receive at least one of whatever is being distributed. See rules 409.1e and 310.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Divide</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Divide has its normal English meaning in the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game. If a spell or ability requires a player to divide something (such as damage or counters) as he or she chooses among one or more targets, or any number of untargeted objects or players, then each of these targets, objects, or players must receive at least one of whatever is being divided. This doesn’t apply to dividing combat damage. See rules 409.1e and 310.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Double Strike</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. Creatures with double strike deal combat damage in both the first-strike combat damage step and the normal combat damage step. See rule 502.28, “Double Strike.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Draw</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Draw has two meanings in the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of his or her library into his or her hand. This is done as a game action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability. If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards or that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty. See rule 423, “Drawing a Card.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">2. A drawn game is a game where the game ends and there is no winner. See rule 102.4.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Draw Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The draw step is the third step of the beginning phase. As the draw step begins, the active player draws a card (this game action does not use the stack). Then the active player gets priority and players may play spells and abilities. See rule 304, “Draw Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Dredge</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Dredge is a static ability that functions only while the card with dredge is in a player’s graveyard. “Dredge N” means “As long as you have at least N cards in your library, if you would draw a card, you may instead put N cards from the top of your library into your graveyard and return this card from your graveyard to your hand.” A player with fewer cards in his or her library than the number required by a dredge ability can’t put any of them into his or her graveyard this way. See rule 502.47, “Dredge.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Dual Land (Informal)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre9">Ravnica™ </em>block and early <strong class="calibre11">Magic </strong>core sets contain “dual lands”; each of these has two basic land types. For example, Temple Garden has the land types Forest and Plains. Dual land cards have the default abilities of both basic land types and are treated as both by all spells and abilities that specifically refer to those types. However, they are not basic lands. A dual land doesn’t count as two lands while in play-it’s just one land with multiple land types.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">During (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards used the phrase “during [phase], [action].” These abilities were called “phase abilities.” In general, cards that were printed with phase abilities now have abilities that trigger at the beginning of a step or phase. “During” still appears in current card text, but only in its normal English sense and not as game terminology.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Echo</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Echo is a triggered ability. “Echo [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay its echo cost.” Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an echo cost; these cards have been given errata to have an echo cost equal to their mana cost. See rule 502.19, “Echo.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Effect</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Ability” and “effect” are often confused with one another. When a spell or ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Some effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. State-based effects are not created by spells or abilities; they are generated by specific states of the game. See rule 416, “Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Emperor</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Emperor is a multiplayer variant with its own rules. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team has one emperor<em class="calibre9">,</em> who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals whose job is to protect the emperor. In addition to the normal rules for winning and losing, a team loses if its emperor loses the game. See rule 607, “Emperor Variant.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Emperor variant uses the following default options: <em class="calibre9">(a)</em> The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals (see rule 601), <em class="calibre9">(b)</em> Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 603), and <em class="calibre9">(c) </em>a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to him or her.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Enchant</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Enchant is a static ability, written “Enchant [permanent or player].” The enchant ability restricts what an Aura spell can target and what an Aura can enchant. See rule 212.4, “Enchantment,” and rule 502.45, “Enchant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Enchant Opponent, Enchant Player</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Auras with the “enchant opponent” or “enchant player” ability can target and be attached to players. Such Auras can’t target permanents and can’t be attached to permanents. Rules 212.4d-k apply to an Aura with enchant player or enchant opponent in relation to players as they normally would for permanents. See also Aura, Enchant.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Enchantment</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>

      <h5 class="subtitle">End of Combat Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The end of combat step is the fifth step of the combat phase. A player may play spells and abilities during this step whenever he or she has priority. See rule 311, “End of Combat Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">End of Turn Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">This is the first step of the end phase. A player may play spells and abilities during this step whenever he or she has priority. See rule 313, “End of Turn Step.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">End Phase</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Ending the Turn</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">One card (Time Stop) ends the turn when its resolves. When an effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order: Remove every object on the stack from the game. Remove all attacking and blocking creatures, if any, from combat. Check state-based effects. The current step and/or phase ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. See rule 509, “Ending the Turn.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Entwine</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Entwine is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. “Entwine [cost]” means “You may choose to use all modes of this spell instead of just one. If you do, you pay an additional [cost].” When the spell resolves, if the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes in the order they’re written on the card. See rule 502.32, “Entwine.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Epic</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Epic represents both a static ability and a delayed triggered ability. “Epic” means, “For the rest of the game, you can’t play spells,” and “At the beginning of each of your upkeeps, copy this spell except for its epic ability. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy.” See rule 502.44, “Epic.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Equip</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Equip is an activated ability. “Equip [cost]” means “[Cost]: Attach this Equipment to target creature you control. Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery.” See rule 502.33, “Equip,” and rule 212.2, “Artifacts.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Equipment</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” These artifacts can be attached to (can “equip”) creatures. They can’t equip objects that aren’t creatures. An Equipment is played and comes into play just like any other artifact. Equipment doesn’t come into play equipping a creature. The equip keyword ability moves the Equipment onto a creature you control. (See rule 502.33, “Equip.”) The creature an Equipment is attached to is called “equipped.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An Equipment that’s also a creature or an Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent, but remains in play. (This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.)</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability.

      <h5 class="subtitle">Exchange</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A spell or ability may instruct two players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if it can’t exchange the chosen things, it has no effect on them.</div>

        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature. Or if a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but both of those creatures are controlled by the same player, the spell does nothing to the two creatures.</em>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">When control of two permanents is exchanged, each player simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player’s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, cards removed from the game and cards in a player’s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other “exchange” spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The small icon normally printed below the right edge of the illustration on a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card is the expansion symbol. It indicates the set in which the card was published. Cards reprinted in a core set or another expansion receive its expansion symbol. Spells and abilities that affect cards from a particular expansion only affect cards with that set’s expansion symbol. The first five editions of the core set had no expansion symbol. See rule 206, “Expansion Symbol.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Extra Turn</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some spells and abilities can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the current turn. If a player gets multiple extra turns or if multiple players get extra turns during a single turn, the extra turns are added one at a time. The most recently created turn will be taken first. See rule 300.6.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Grand Melee multiplayer variant has a special rule to handle when extra turns are taken: If a player would take an extra turn after the current turn and it’s not currently that player’s turn, that player instead takes the extra turn immediately before his or her next turn. See rule 608, “Grand Melee Variant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Face Down</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Face-down spells on the stack, face-down permanents in play, and face-down cards in the phased-out zone have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the card, spell, or permanent to be turned face down. Any listed characteristics are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack, a face-down permanent you control, or a face-down card in the phased-out zone you controlled when it phased out. You can’t look at face-down cards in any other zone, face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player, or face-down cards in the phased-out zone last controlled by another player.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The ability or rules that allowed a permanent to be turned face down may also allow the permanent’s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally can’t be turned face up.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If you control multiple face-down spells on the stack or face-down permanents in play, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">See rule 504, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” and rule 502.26, “Morph.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Fading</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Fading is a keyword ability that represents two abilities. “Fading N” means “This permanent comes into play with N fade counters on it” and “At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this permanent. If you can’t, sacrifice the permanent.” See rule 502.20, “Fading.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Fear</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Fear is an evasion ability. A creature with fear can’t be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures. See rule 502.25, “Fear.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">First Strike</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. At the start of the combat damage step, if at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike (see rule 502.28), creatures without first strike or double strike don’t assign combat damage. Instead of proceeding to end of combat, the phase gets a second combat damage step to handle the remaining creatures. See rule 502.2, “First Strike.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Fizzle (Informal)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The term “fizzle” is an informal term, used when a spell or ability was countered as a result of all its targets being missing or illegal when it resolved. See rule 413.2a.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Flanking</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare blockers step of the combat phase. “Flanking” means “Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.” See rule 502.3, “Flanking.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Flash</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on. “Flash” means “You may play this card any time you could play an instant.” See rule 502.57, “Flash.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Flashback</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one functions while the card is in a player’s graveyard and the other functions while the card is on the stack. “Flashback [cost]” means “You may play this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost” and “If the flashback cost was paid, remove this card from the game instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.” Playing a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 409.1b and 409.1f-h. See rule 502.22, “Flashback.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Flavor Text</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">This is text in italics (but not in parentheses) in the text box of a card. It provides a mood or gives interesting background detail for the game world but has no effect on play. See rule 207.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Flip a Coin</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To flip a coin for an object that cares whether a player wins or loses the flip, the affected player flips the coin and calls “heads” or “tails.” If the call matches the result, that player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To flip a coin for an object that cares whether the coin comes up heads or tails, each affected player flips a coin without making a call. No player wins or loses this kind of flip.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If the coin that’s being flipped doesn’t have an obvious “heads” or “tails,” designate one side to be “heads,” and the other side to be “tails.” Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Flip Cards</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card’s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal <strong class="calibre11">Magic: The Gathering</strong> card back. See rule 508, “Flip Cards.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The top half of a flip card contains the card’s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to “flip” if certain conditions are met. The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is in play and only if the permanent is flipped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A flip card’s color, mana cost, expansion symbol, illustration credit, and legal text don’t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In every zone other than the in-play zone, and also in the in-play zone before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the permanent. Once the flip permanent in the in-play zone is flipped, the normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness of the flip permanent don’t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If you control a flip permanent, you must ensure that it’s clear at all times whether the permanent is flipped or not, both when it’s untapped and when it’s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it’s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if flipped permanent leaves play, it retains no memory of its status.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Forecast</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Forecast is a special kind of activated ability that can be played only from a player’s hand. It’s written “Forecast – [Activated ability].” A forecast ability may be played only during the upkeep step of the card’s owner and only once each turn. The controller of the forecast ability reveals the card with that ability from his or her hand as the ability is played. That player plays with that card revealed in his or her hand until the upkeep step ends or until it leaves the player’s hand, whichever comes first.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Game Action</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Several steps contain actions that don’t use the stack. These actions are game actions. The game actions are phasing in and out at the start of the untap step (see rule 302.1), untapping at the start of the untap step (see rule 302.2), drawing a card at the start of the draw step (see rule 304.1), declaring attackers at the start of the declare attackers step (see rule 308.1), declaring blockers at the start of the declare blockers step (see rule 309.1), the active player discarding down to his or her maximum hand size at the start of the cleanup step (see rule 314), and removing damage from permanents and ending “until end of turn” effects at the start of the cleanup step (see rule 314). Mana burn at the end of a phase is also a game action (see rule 300.3).</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Graft</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Graft represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. “Graft N” means “This permanent comes into play with N +1/+1 counters on it” and “Whenever another creature comes into play, you may move a +1/+1 counter from this permanent onto that creature.” If a creature has multiple instances of graft, each one works separately.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Grand Melee</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving <em class="calibre9">turn markers </em>keep track of which players are currently taking turns<em class="calibre9">.</em> Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with the term islandhome, which means “This creature can’t attack unless the defending player controls an Island” and “When you control no Islands, sacrifice this creature.” Cards that previously had islandhome now simply have the two parts of islandhome written out without using the keyword.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Keyword Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some abilities are very common or would require too much space to define on a card. These abilities list only the name of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule. See rule 502, “Keyword Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Kicker</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Kicker is a keyword ability with a cost and an effect. Paying a spell’s kicker cost causes the spell to have an additional or alternative effect. See rule 502.21, “Kicker.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">“Kicker [cost]” means “You may pay an additional [cost] as you play this spell.” You declare whether you intend to pay a spell’s kicker cost at the same time you would choose the spell’s mode (see rule 409.1b), and you actually pay the cost when you pay the rest of the spell’s costs (see rule 409.1f-h). Paying a kicker cost is always optional.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A spell’s controller chooses targets (see rule 409.1d) for a kicker effect only if he or she declared the intention to pay the kicker cost for that effect. If the spell’s controller declared that he or she wouldn’t pay a particular kicker cost, he or she doesn’t choose the targets for the effect associated with that kicker cost.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Land</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Land is a type. Lands aren’t spells and don’t go on the stack; they are simply played from the hand. The active player may play a land once each turn during his or her main phase when he or she has priority and the stack is empty. If an object is both a land and another type, it can only be played as a land. It can’t be played as a spell. See rule 212.6, “Lands.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Land Type</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Land – Locus, Land – Urza’s Mine,” etc. Land subtypes are also called land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. Note that “basic,” “legendary,” and “nonbasic” aren’t land types. See rule 212.6, “Lands.” See also Basic Land Type.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The list of land types, updated through the <em class="calibre9">Time Spiral</em> set, is as follows:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Desert, Forest, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, Urza’s</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Landcycling</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Landcycling” is a generic term; a card’s rules text usually names a specific type of land, such as “plainscycling.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Landcycling is an activated ability. “Plainscycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a Plains card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.” See rule 502.18, “Cycling.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">“Landwalk” is a generic term; a card’s rules text will give a specific property to look for, such as “islandwalk.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Landwalk is an evasion ability. A creature with landwalk is unblockable as long as the defending player controls at least one land which has the specified subtype or supertype. See rule 502.6, “Landwalk.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Last Known Information</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The last known information about an object is the information that it had just before it left the zone it was in. Effects from resolving spells and abilities use last known information if the object they require information from isn’t in the zone it’s expected to be in (unless the effect divides damage). See rule 413.2f.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Layer</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Continuous effects are applied in order, in six layers: (1) copy effects (see rule 503, “Copying Objects”); (2) control-changing effects; (3) text-changing effects; (4) type-, subtype-, and supertype-changing effects; (5) all other continuous effects, except those that change power and/or toughness, and (6) power– and/or toughness-changing effects. Inside layer 6, effects are applied in a series of sublayers. See rule 418.5, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</div>

      <div class="paragraph">A permanent leaves play when it moves from the in-play zone to any other zone (see rule 410.10c) or when its owner leaves the game (see rule 600.4a).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a token leaves play, it ceases to exist. This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a permanent leaves play and later returns to play, it’s treated as an entirely new permanent with no “memory” of anything from its former existence. (Phasing is an exception to this; see rule 502.15, “Phasing.” Permanents that phase out also don’t trigger any comes-into-play or leaves-play abilities.)</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Legal Text</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Legal text (the fine print at the bottom of the card) lists the copyright information. It has no effect on game play. See rule 210, “Legal Text.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Legend (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Many creature cards were printed with the creature type “Legend.” All of these cards have been given errata to have the legendary supertype. Legend is no longer a creature type. See Legendary.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Legendary</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Legendary is a supertype that may apply to any type (“Legendary Land,” “Legendary Artifact,” and so on).</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If two or more legendary permanents with the same name are in play, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This “legend rule” is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a legendary permanent’s types or subtypes change, this doesn’t change its supertypes. The permanent will still be legendary.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Lethal Damage</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Lethal damage is an amount of damage greater than or equal to a creature’s toughness. A creature with lethal damage, but greater than 0 toughness, is destroyed. This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Library</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The library is the zone from which a player draws cards. When a game begins, each player’s deck becomes his or her library. See rule 217.2, “Library.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Life, Life Total</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Life total is a sort of score. Each player starts the game with 20 life. Any increase in a player’s life total is considered to be gaining life. Any decrease in a player’s life total is considered to be losing life. A player whose life total drops to 0 or less loses. This is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">LIFO (Informal)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An acronym for “Last In, First Out,” LIFO is the order in which spells and abilities resolve after going on the stack. The last played is resolved first. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities,” and rule 413, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Limited Range of Influence</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Limited range of influence is an optional rule used in some multiplayer games. A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, and making choices. See rule 601, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The limited range of influence option is always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 607), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Local Enchantment (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards used the term “local enchantment” for enchantments that are attached to other permanents while they’re in play. These cards now have the Aura subtype.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Lose the Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There are several ways to lose the game. A player can concede the game at any time; a player who concedes loses the game immediately. If a player’s life total is 0 or less, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (this is a state-based effect; see rule 420). If a player attempts to draw a card from an empty library, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority (this is a state-based effect; see rule 420). If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (this is a state-based effect; see rule 420). If a player would both win and lose simultaneously, he or she loses. In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all players on that team have lost. See rule 102, “Winning and Losing.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Madness</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. “Madness [cost]” means “If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but may remove it from the game instead of putting it into his or her graveyard” and “When this card is removed from the game this way, its owner may play it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn’t, he or she puts this card into his or her graveyard.” See rule 502.24, “Madness.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Main Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some cards allow players to play a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> subgame. The “main game” is the game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was played. See rule 506, “Subgames.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Main Phase</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The term “main phase” comprises the first main and second main phases, also called the “precombat” and “postcombat” main phases. Artifact, creature, enchantment, and sorcery spells may be played only by the active player during his or her main phase, and only when the stack is empty. A player may also play one land each turn during his or her main phase.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Mana is the energy used to play spells and is usually produced by lands. Mana is created by mana abilities (and sometimes by spells), and it can be used to pay costs immediately or can stay in the player’s mana pool. See rule 406, “Mana Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Colored mana costs, represented by colored mana symbols, can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. Generic mana costs can be paid with any color of, or with colorless, mana. See rule 104.3.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spell or ability that adds mana to a mana pool may restrict how it can be used. An ability might produce mana that can be used only to play creature spells or only to pay activation costs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The type of mana a permanent “could produce” is the type of mana that any ability of that permanent can generate, taking into account any applicable replacement effects. If the type of mana can’t be defined, there’s no type of mana that that permanent could produce. The “type” of mana is its color, or lack thereof (for colorless mana).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A mana ability is either activated or triggered. A mana ability doesn’t go on the stack-it resolves immediately. See rule 411, “Playing Mana Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A player may play an activated mana ability whenever he or she has priority and whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment. This is the only type of ability that can be played in the middle of playing or resolving a spell or ability. See rule 406, “Mana Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Burn</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">When a phase ends, any unused mana remaining in a player’s mana pool is lost. The player loses 1 life for each mana lost this way. This is called “mana burn.” See rule 300.3.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Cost</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The mana cost of a card is indicated by the mana symbols printed on its upper right corner. If a card has no mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, it has no mana cost. Land cards and face-down spells and permanents normally have no mana cost. Tokens have no mana cost unless the effect that creates them specifies otherwise. A copy of an object copies that object’s mana cost. See rule 203, “Mana Cost and Color.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Pool</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">When an effect creates mana, that mana goes into the player’s mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay for spells and abilities. The mana can be used immediately to pay a cost, or stored in the mana pool for use later in the phase. The mana pool is cleared at the end of each phase. See also Mana Burn.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Source (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with the type “mana source.” All mana source cards are now instant cards. Abilities that used to read “Play this ability as a mana source” are now mana abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mana Symbol</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, {X}, {Y}, and {Z}; the numerals {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; and the snow symbol {S}. See rule 104.3.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Each of the colored mana symbols represents one colored mana: {W} white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green. See rule 104.3a.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Numeral symbols (such as {1}) are generic mana costs and represent an amount of mana that can be paid with any color of, or colorless, mana. See rule 104.3b.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The symbols {X}, {Y} and {Z} represent unspecified amounts of mana; when playing a spell or activated ability with {X}, {Y}, or {Z} in its cost, its controller decides the value of that variable. See rule 104.3c.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Numeral symbols and variable symbols can also represent colorless mana if they appear in the effect of a spell or of a mana ability that reads “add [mana symbol] to your mana pool” or something similar. See rule 104.3d.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder when a spell or activated ability costs nothing to play. A spell or ability whose cost is {0} must still be played the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won’t play itself automatically. See rule 104.3e.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Each of the hybrid mana symbols represents a cost which can be paid with one of two colors: {W/U} in a cost can be paid with either white or blue mana, {W/B} white or black, {U/B} blue or black, {U/R} blue or red, {B/R} black or red, {B/G} black or green, {R/G} red or green, {R/W} red or white, {G/W} green or white, and {G/U} green or blue. See rule 104.3f.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The symbol {S} represents a cost that can be paid with one mana produced by a snow permanent. See rule 104.3h.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Match</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A match is a series of <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> games and is important only for tournament or league play.

      <h5 class="subtitle">Maximum Hand Size</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Each player’s maximum hand size is normally seven cards, though effects may modify this. As the first part of the active player’s cleanup step, if he or she has too many cards in his or her hand, that player chooses and discards as many cards as needed to reduce his or her hand to its maximum size (but no more than that). See rule 314, “Cleanup Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Modal, Mode</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A spell or ability is modal if it is written “choose one -” or “[a specified player] chooses one -.” Modal spells and abilities offer a choice of effects. A modal spell or ability’s controller must choose the mode as part of playing the spell or ability or as part of putting the ability on the stack (in the case of triggered abilities); see rule 409.1b. A modal replacement effect’s mode is chosen as it’s applied; see rule 419.6g.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Modular</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Modular represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. “Modular N” means “This permanent comes into play with N +1/+1 counters on it” and “When this permanent is put into a graveyard from play, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent.” See rule 502.35, “Modular.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Mono Artifact (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards used the term “mono artifact” on the card’s type line. They were artifacts that had activated abilities that included the tap symbol. Cards that were printed with the term “mono artifact” now simply use “artifact.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Morph</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Morph is a static ability that functions any time you could play the card it’s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. “Morph [cost]” means “You may play this card as a 2/2 face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than its mana cost.” Any time you could play an instant, you may show all players the morph cost for any face-down permanent you control, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. This action doesn’t use the stack. See rule 502.26, “Morph.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To move a counter means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto another object. If the object the counter would move from has no counters, or either that object or any possible objects the counter would move onto are no longer in the correct zone when the effect would move the counter, nothing happens.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards used “move” to describe taking an Aura on one permanent and putting it onto another. These cards now say “attach.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A player can “mulligan” by shuffling his or her hand back into his or her library and drawing a new hand with one fewer card before taking the first turn. Any player dissatisfied with his or her starting hand may mulligan as often as he or she wishes, drawing one fewer card each time. See rule 101.4.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The Two-Headed Giant variant uses a modified mulligan rule; see rule 606.6a.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">A multicolored card has two or more colors. Most multicolored cards are printed with gold frames to reinforce this. See rule 203.2.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A multicolored object is affected by anything that singles out any of its colors. For example, a black-and-green creature is destroyed by a spell that reads, “Destroy all green creatures.” Something that can’t affect a particular color doesn’t affect a multicolored object with that color, so that same creature can’t be targeted by a spell or ability that reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Object</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An “object” is a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, an ability on the stack, or combat damage on the stack. The term “object” is used in these rules when a rule applies to cards, copies of cards, tokens, spells, permanents, abilities on the stack, and combat damage on the stack. See rule 200.8.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Obsolete</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Terms marked “(Obsolete)” in this glossary were used only on older cards. Updated wordings for all cards that used these terms are available in the Oracle card reference.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Offering</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Offering is a static ability of a card that functions in any zone from which the card can be played. “[Text] offering” means “You may play this card any time you could play an instant by sacrificing a [text] permanent. If you do, the total cost to play this card is reduced by the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost.” Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost reduces only the generic mana in the offering card’s total cost. See rule 502.42, “Offering.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Opening Hand</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Before a game begins, but after a player has taken any mulligans, the hand of cards he or she chooses to keep is that player’s opening hand. A player can’t take any mulligans once he or she has decided to keep an opening hand.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Opponent</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player. In multiplayer games, a player has multiple opponents. See section 6, “Multiplayer Rules.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Oracle</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Use the Oracle card reference when determining a card’s wording. A card’s Oracle text can be found using the Gatherer card database at <del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">http://gatherer.wizards.com</strong></del>. See rule 200.2.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Order</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when effects allow it. Objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they’re tapped, and what enchants or equips them must remain clear to all players. See rule 217.1b.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Outside the Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An object is “outside the game” if it’s in the removed-from-the-game zone, or if it isn’t in any of the game’s zones. All other objects are inside the game. “Outside the game” is not a zone. See rule 217.1e.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Owner</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The owner of a card is the player who started the game with that card in his or her deck or, for cards that didn’t start the game in a player’s deck, the player who brought the card into the game. (Legal ownership is irrelevant to the game rules, except for the rules for ante.) The owner of a token is the controller of the effect that created it. See rule 200.1a.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect can change a permanent’s controller but never its owner. (A few cards have the text “Remove [this card] from your deck before playing if you’re not playing for ante.” These are the only cards that can change a card’s owner. See rule 217.9, “Ante.”)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A card is always put into its owner’s library, hand, or graveyard, regardless of who controlled the card in its previous zone. See rule 217.1a.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Pass</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To pass is to decline to take any action (usually playing a spell or ability) when you have priority. When a player passes, his or her opponent receives priority. See rule 408.1, “Timing, Priority, and the Stack.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Pass in Succession</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To pass in succession means that all players pass without playing any spells, playing any abilities, or performing any special actions in between. If all players pass in succession, the spell, ability, or combat damage on top of the stack resolves. If the stack is empty, the phase or step ends. See rule 408.1, “Timing, Priority, and the Stack.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Pay</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Playing most spells and activated abilities requires paying costs; see rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.” Declaring attackers (see rule 308, “Declare Attackers Step”) and declaring blockers (see rule 309, “Declare Blockers Step”) can also require paying costs.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Paying mana is done by removing the indicated amount of mana from the player’s mana pool. Any time a player is asked to pay mana, mana abilities may be played. Mana abilities must be played before the costs are paid. Paying life subtracts the indicated amount of life from the player’s life total. A player can’t pay more mana than the amount of mana in his or her mana pool or more life than his or her life total. Zero life or zero mana can always be paid, even if the player has less than zero life.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">To pay any cost, the player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect. It’s illegal to attempt paying a cost when unable to successfully follow the instructions. For example, a player can’t pay a cost that requires tapping a creature if that creature is already tapped.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Each payment applies to only one spell or ability. For example, a player can’t sacrifice just one creature to play the activated abilities of two permanents that require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn’t pay another spell or ability’s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Permanent</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent is any card or token in the in-play zone. See rule 214, “Permanents.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Permanently (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Certain older cards were printed with the term “permanently” to indicate effects with no expiration. This term is no longer used.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <em class="calibre9">
          <strong class="calibre11">Example:</strong> An ability that originally read “Gain control of target creature permanently” would now read as follows: “Gain control of target creature.” This effect grants control of the permanent until something else changes the controller or it leaves play.

      <h5 class="subtitle">Phased Out</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Pile</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">If a player is asked to separate a group of objects into two or more piles, the objects do not leave the zone they’re currently in. If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained. A pile can contain zero or more objects.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Plains</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">“Plains” is one of the five basic land types. Any land with the land type Plains has the ability “{T}: Add {W} to your mana pool.” See rule 212.6d.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The act of playing a spell, land, or ability involves announcing the action and taking the necessary steps to complete it.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Playing a spell or activated ability requires paying any costs and choosing any required modes and/or targets. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Playing a land simply requires choosing a land card from the hand and putting it into play. See rule 212.6, “Lands.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Playing a mana ability requires paying any costs, then immediately resolving the ability. See rule 411, “Playing Mana Abilities.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Whoever plays first in a two-player game skips his or her first draw step. This is referred to as the play/draw rule. See rule 101, “Starting the Game.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In a Two-Headed Giant multiplayer game, the team that goes first skips its first draw step (see rule 606, “Two-Headed Giant Variant”). Other multiplayer variants don’t use the play/draw rule.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Player</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players. See rule 200.3.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Poison Counter</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some cards give poison counters to players. If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 420, “State-Based Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Poly Artifact (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards used the term “poly artifact” on the card’s type line. They were artifacts that had activated abilities that don’t include the tap symbol. Cards that were printed with the term “poly artifact” now simply use “artifact.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Postcombat</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The second main phase in each turn is called the postcombat main phase. If an effect causes a turn to have an extra combat phase and another main phase, the additional one is also a postcombat main phase. See rule 305, “Main Phase.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Power</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The number before the slash printed on the lower right corner of a creature card is its power. See rule 208, “Power/Toughness.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Creatures that attack or block assign combat damage equal to their power. See rule 310, “Combat Damage Step.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some creature cards have power represented by * instead of a number. The object has a characteristic-setting ability that sets its power according to some stated condition. The * is 0 while the object isn’t in play.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A noncreature permanent has no power, even if it’s a card with a power printed on it (such as a Licid that’s become an Aura).</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Prevention Effect</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Effects that prevent something from happening replace it with “do nothing.” (See rule 419, “Replacement and Prevention Effects.”) A prevention effect must be active before the event it’s intended to prevent.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Effects that prevent a specific amount of damage act as “shields” and stay active until that amount of damage has been prevented or the turn ends. The damage doesn’t have to be dealt by a single source or all at once.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Effects that prevent the next damage from a specific source apply the next time that source would deal damage, regardless of the amount. These effects expire when the turn ends. See rule 419.8, “Sources of Damage.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Priority</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The player who has the option to play a spell or ability at any given time has priority. See rule 408, “Timing of Spells and Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Each time a spell, an ability (other than a mana ability), or combat damage resolves, and at the beginning of most phases and steps, the active player receives priority. If a player has priority when he or she plays a spell, ability, or land, or takes a special action, he or she receives priority afterward. When a player passes in a two-player game, his or her opponent receives priority.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If all players pass in succession, the spell, ability, or combat damage on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Each time a player would get priority, all applicable state-based effects resolve first as a single event (see rule 420). Then, if any new state-based effects have been generated, they resolve as a single event. This process repeats until no more applicable state-based effects are generated. Then triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based effects or triggered abilities are generated.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule 606, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Protection</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Protection is a static ability, written “Protection from [quality].” See rule 502.7, “Protection.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent with protection can’t be targeted by spells with the stated quality and can’t be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent with protection can’t be enchanted by Auras that have the stated quality. Such Auras attached to the permanent with protection will be put into their owners’ graveyards as a state-based effect. (See rule 420, “State-Based Effects.”)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent with protection can’t be equipped by Equipment that has the stated quality. Such Equipment becomes unattached from that permanent, but remains in play. (See rule 420, “State-Based Effects.”)</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Any damage that would be dealt to a permanent with protection from sources having that quality is prevented.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a creature with protection attacks, it can’t be blocked by creatures that have the stated quality.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Provoke</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Provoke is a triggered ability. “Provoke” means “Whenever this creature attacks, you may choose to have target creature defending player controls block this creature this combat if able. If you do, untap that creature.” See rule 502.29, “Provoke.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Rampage</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Rampage is a triggered ability. “Rampage N” means “When this creature becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn for each creature blocking it beyond the first.” See rule 502.12, “Rampage.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Redirect (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with the term “redirect” to describe the act of dealing damage to a different player or creature than originally specified by a spell, ability, or combat-damage assignment, without changing the source or type of damage. In general, cards that were printed with the term “redirect” now create replacement effects that modify where the damage will be dealt. “Redirect” is still used informally to describe what these replacement effects do.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Regenerate</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage from it, tap it, and (if it’s in combat) remove it from combat.” Because it’s a replacement effect, it must be active before the attempted destruction event. Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule 419.6b.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Reminder Text</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Reminder text appears after a keyword ability printed on a card and on cards that might otherwise be commonly misunderstood. Reminder text is text that is italicized and in parentheses in the text box of a card. This text provides a summary of the game rule or clarifies what the card does, but it isn’t itself considered rules text. See rule 207.2.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Removed from Combat</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An attacking or blocking creature is removed from combat if it leaves play (such as by being destroyed or removed from the game), if it regenerates (see rule 419.6b), if its controller changes, if it stops being a creature, or if an effect removes it from combat. A creature that is removed from combat stops being an attacking or blocking creature and can no longer assign combat damage or have combat damage assigned to it. Any combat damage that’s already on the stack assigned to or by the creature will still resolve normally. See rule 306.2 and rule 310.4a.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Removed from the Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A card removed from the game is out of play. The effect that removed the card may specify a way for it to return. Some objects use the expression “set aside” for situations in which a card removed from the game can return to play. See rule 217.7, “Removed from the Game.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Replicate</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Replicate is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. The second is a triggered ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. “Replicate [cost]” means “As an additional cost to play this spell, you may pay [cost] any number of times” and “When you play this spell, if a replicate cost was paid for it, copy it for each time its replicate cost was paid. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any number of the copies.” See rule 502.52, “Replicate.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Resolve</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">When a spell or ability on top of the stack resolves, its controller carries out the instructions printed on the card, in the order written.

      <h5 class="subtitle">Respond, Response (Informal)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A player can choose to play an instant spell or activated ability when something else is already on the stack, rather than waiting for the earlier spell or ability to resolve first. The spell or ability is said to be played “in response to” the earlier spell or ability. See rule 408, “Timing of Spells and Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Restriction</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A restriction on attacking or blocking is any effect that could prevent a creature from attacking or blocking. All attacks and blocks must still be legal. See rule 500, “Legal Attacks and Blocks.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Reveal</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To reveal an object is to show that object to all players. If a one-shot effect reveals a card, the card is returned to its former state after all players have seen it. If the cost to play a spell or ability includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until it leaves the stack.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Ripple</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Ripple is a triggered ability that functions only while the card with ripple is on the stack. “Ripple N” means “When you play this spell, you may reveal the top N cards of your library, or, if there are fewer than N cards in your library, you may reveal all the cards in your library. If you reveal cards from your library this way, you may play any of those cards with the same name as this spell without paying their mana costs, then put all revealed cards not played this way on the bottom of your library in any order.” See rule 502.56, “Ripple.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Sacrifice</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the in-play zone directly to its owner’s graveyard. A player can’t sacrifice something that isn’t a permanent, or something that’s a permanent he or she doesn’t control. If an effect instructs a player to sacrifice a permanent that he or she doesn’t control, nothing happens. Sacrificing a permanent doesn’t destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can’t affect it.</div>

Even if you don’t find any cards, you are still considered to have searched the zone.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If you’re simply searching for a quantity of cards, such as “a card” or “three cards,” you must find that many cards (or as many as possible). These cards often aren’t revealed.</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant uses a shared life total. Each two-player team’s life total starts at 40, and the team loses if its life total reaches 0. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happens to each player individually. The result is applied to the team’s shared life total. If an effect needs to know the value of any individual player’s life total, that effect uses the team’s life total divided by the number of players on the team (rounded up) instead.

      <div class="paragraph">Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip his or her next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, he or she may choose a permanent, a spell on the stack (including one that creates a permanent), or any object referred to by an object on the stack (including a creature that assigned combat damage on the stack, even if the creature is no longer in play or is no longer a creature). A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. See rule 419.8, “Sources of Damage.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Spell</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A nonland card becomes a spell when it’s put on the stack and remains a spell until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule 213, “Spells,” and rule 401, “Spells on the Stack.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Splice</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. “Splice onto [type or subtype] [cost]” means “You may reveal this card from your hand as you play a [type or subtype] spell. If you do, copy this card’s text box onto that spell and pay [cost] as an additional cost to play that spell.” Paying a card’s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 409.1b and 409.1f-h.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">You can’t choose to use a splice ability if you can’t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card’s instructions. You can’t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you’re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their instructions will be followed. The instructions on the main spell have to be followed first.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the text boxes of each of the spliced cards. The spell doesn’t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text copied onto the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 409.1c). Note that a spell with one or more targets will be countered if all of its targets are illegal on resolution.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack (for example, when it’s countered, it’s removed from the game, or it resolves).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Split Cards</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal, full-size <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card back. Split cards have two sets of characteristics: two names, two mana costs, and so on. They always have both sets, except when they’re spells on the stack. When you play a split card, you announce which side you’re playing. While it’s on the stack, the other side is ignored completely. See rule 505, “Split Cards.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Split cards have two mana costs with different colors of mana in them. That means they are multicolored cards while they’re not on the stack. A split card is a multicolored card on the stack only if the half that’s been played is multicolored.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If an effect tells you to name a card, you must name all of a split card’s names.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect that asks for a split card’s characteristic while it’s in a zone other than the stack gets both answers.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect that performs a positive comparison or a relative comparison involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if either side of those split cards would return a “yes” answer if compared individually.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect that performs a negative comparison involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack also gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if performing the comparable positive comparison would return a “no” answer.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Split Second</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Split second is a static ability that functions only while the spell with split second is on the stack. “Split second” means “As long as this spell is on the stack, players can’t play other spells or abilities that aren’t mana abilities.” See rule 502.58, “Split Second.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Stack</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A spell or ability goes on top of the stack when it’s played or put onto the stack. Combat-damage assignments also go on top of the stack as though they were a single object. Whenever all players pass in succession, the spell, ability, or combat damage on top of the stack resolves and the active player receives priority again. See rule 217.6, “Stack,” and rule 408.1, “Timing, Priority, and the Stack.”</div>

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">State Triggers</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">State triggers are triggered abilities that watch for a game state rather than an event and trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. Once a state trigger has triggered, it won’t trigger again until the ability it created has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. See rule 410.11.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Static Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Static abilities do something all the time rather than being played at specific times. Static abilities create continuous effects, which are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains in play and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone. See rule 412, “Handling Static Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Status</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are three status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, and face up/face down. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Permanents come into play untapped, unflipped, and face up unless a spell or ability says otherwise.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Subtype</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line. Subtypes are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each word after the dash is a separate subtype.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types. Instant subtypes are also called instant types. Land subtypes are also called land types. Sorcery subtypes are also called sorcery types. Objects may have multiple subtypes.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If an artifact creature card has subtypes printed on its type line, those subtypes are creature types. If an artifact land card has subtypes printed on its type line, those types are land types.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Most card types each have their own unique set of possible subtypes. However, instants and sorceries can share subtypes. Collectively, instant and sorcery subtypes are called “spell types.”</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Successfully Cast (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with the term “successfully cast.” In general, any ability that’s written as triggering when a spell is “successfully cast” should be read as triggering when the spell is played.</div>

      <h5 class="subtitle">Sunburst</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is coming into play from the stack. “Sunburst” means “If this object is coming into play from the stack as a creature, it comes into play with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana used to pay its cost. If this object is coming into play from the stack and isn’t coming into play as a creature, it comes into play with a charge counter on it for each color of mana used to pay its cost.” See rule 502.37, “Sunburst.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Supertype</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A card can have one or more “supertypes.” These are printed directly before the card’s types. If an object’s types or subtypes change, any supertypes it has are kept, although they may not be relevant to the new type. See rule 205.4, “Supertypes.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An object’s supertype is independent of its type and subtype. Changing an object’s type or subtype won’t change its supertype. Changing an object’s supertype won’t change its type or subtype. When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had. See rule 212. “Type, Supertype, and Subtype.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The list of supertypes, updated through the <em class="calibre9">Time Spiral</em> set, is as follows: basic, legendary, snow, and world.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Suspend</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a player's hand. The second and third are triggered abilities that function in the removed-from-the-game zone. “Suspend N-[cost]” means “If you could play this card from your hand, you may pay [cost] and remove it from the game with N time counters on it. This action doesn’t use the stack,” and “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a time counter from it,” and “When the last time counter is removed from this card, if it’s removed from the game, play it without paying its mana cost if able. If you can’t, it remains removed from the game. If you play a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of the spell or the permanent it becomes.” Playing a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 409.1b and 409.1f-h.

      <div class="paragraph">To tap a permanent is to turn it sideways. The tap symbol ({T} in these rules) in an activation cost means “Tap this permanent”-a permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped again to pay the cost. Creatures that haven’t been under a player’s control continuously since the beginning of his or her most recent turn can’t use any ability of theirs with the tap symbol in the cost.

      <div class="paragraph">Whenever the phrase “target [something],” where [something] is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone, appears in a spell or ability, the controller of the spell or ability chooses something that matches whatever follows that word. The choice of a spell or ability’s targets is made when the spell or ability is played. See rule 415, “Targeted Spells and Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">An instant or sorcery is targeted if the text that will be followed when it resolves uses the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone.

      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Text Box</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The text box is printed below the illustration on a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> card and contains rules text that defines the card’s abilities, reminder text, and flavor text. See rule 207, “Text Box.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Text-Changing Effect</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An effect that changes the text of an object changes only words that are used in the correct way (for example, a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). The effect can’t change a proper noun, such as a card name, even if that proper noun contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> color word, basic land type, or creature type. See rule 418.6, “Text-Changing Effects.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Threshold</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Threshold used to be a keyword ability. It is now an ability word and has no rules meaning. All cards printed with the threshold keyword have received errata. Updated wordings are available in the Oracle card reference.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Tie</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game has no default for ties.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Timestamp Order</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An object’s timestamp is the time it entered the zone it’s currently in, with three exceptions: (1) If two or more objects enter a zone simultaneously, the active player determines their timestamp order at the time they enter that zone. (2) Whenever an Aura or Equipment becomes attached to a permanent, the Aura or Equipment receives a new timestamp. (3) Permanents that phase in keep the same timestamps they had when they phased out. See rule 418.5e. See also Depend On.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Continuous effects generated by static abilities have the same timestamp as the object that generated them. Continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receive a timestamp at the time they’re created.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Token</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card. Tokens are created by effects. Tokens can be tapped and untapped just like cards, though an alternative to rotation might be needed to distinguish their status. See rule 216, “Tokens.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Tombstone Icon</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many <em class="calibre9">Odyssey</em> block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player’s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they’re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play. See rule 104.5.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Total Casting Cost (Obsolete)</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some older cards were printed with the term “total casting cost” to describe the converted mana cost of a spell. In general, cards that were printed with the term “total casting cost” now use the term “converted mana cost.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Total Cost</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The total cost of a spell or activated ability is the mana cost, activation cost, or alternative cost, plus all cost increases and minus all cost reductions. See rule 409.1f</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Toughness</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The number after the slash printed on the lower right corner of a creature card is its toughness. See rule 208, “Power/Toughness.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A creature that’s been dealt damage greater than or equal to its toughness (and greater than 0) has lethal damage and will be destroyed the next time any player would receive priority. This is a state-based effect.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Some creature cards have toughness represented by * instead of a number. The object has a characteristic-setting ability that sets its toughness according to some stated condition. The * is 0 while the object isn’t in play.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">A noncreature permanent has no toughness, even if it’s a card with a toughness printed on it (such as a Licid that’s become an Aura).</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Tournament</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A tournament is an organized event where players compete against other players to win prizes. See the Tournament Locator on the <strong class="calibre11">MagicTheGathering.com</strong> Tournament Center page (<del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/tournamentcenter</strong></del>) to find tournaments in your area.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Trample</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Trample is a static ability modifying the combat damage step of the combat phase. It lets an attacking creature “trample over” blocking creatures and assign part of its combat damage to the defending player. See rule 502.9, “Trample.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Transmute</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Transmute is an activated ability that functions only while the card with transmute is in a player’s hand. “Transmute [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a card with the same converted mana cost as the discarded card, reveal that card, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library. Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery.” See rule 502.48, “Transmute.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Trigger, Triggered Ability</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A triggered ability begins with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability goes on top of the stack the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 404, “Triggered Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Trigger Condition</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A triggered ability begins with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” The phrase containing one of these words is the trigger condition, which defines the trigger event. See rule 404, “Triggered Abilities.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Turn Marker</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns<em class="calibre9">.</em> Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn. See rule 608, “Grand Melee.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Two-Headed Giant</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Two-Headed Giant variant has two unique features. Each two-player team has a shared life total, which starts at 40 life, and each team has takes turns rather than each player. Each team’s creatures also attack the other team rather than individual players. The additional rules for the Two-Headed Giant variant explain how the timing of team turns works. See rule 606, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Type</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The word “type” has two meanings:</div>
      <div class="paragraph">1. A card’s type (and subtype and supertype, if applicable) is printed directly below the illustration on the card, on its type line. Cards, tokens, permanents, and spells all have types. Abilities don’t have types. See rule 205, “Type Line,” and rule 212, “Type, Supertype, and Subtype.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">When an effect changes an object’s type, the new type replaces all previous types. If the effect is adding a type, or allowing an object to retain its types, it will say so. See rule 212.1c.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">2. The “type” of mana is its color, or lack thereof (for colorless mana). See also Mana.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Type Line</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The type (and subtype and supertype, if applicable) of a card is printed directly below the illustration. See rule 205, “Type Line,” and rule 212, “Type, Supertype, and Subtype.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Type-Changing Effect</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A type-changing effect is an effect that changes the type of an object. It’s generated by a type-changing ability. See rule 418.5a.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Unattach</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">An Aura or Equipment becomes unattached if it was attached to a permanent and then is not. If an Aura or Equipment leaves play while attached to a permanent, it becomes unattached. If a permanent leaves play (unless it phases out) while an Aura or Equipment is attached to it, the Aura or Equipment becomes unattached.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Unblockable</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">If an attacking creature “is unblockable,” no creature can legally block it. Spells or abilities may still cause it to become blocked.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Unblocked</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A creature is unblocked if it’s attacking and no creature blocked it during the declare blockers step of the current combat phase. It remains an unblocked creature until an effect causes it to become blocked, it’s removed from combat, it stops being a creature, its controller changes, or the combat phase ends. Unblocked creatures don’t exist outside of the combat phase or before the declare blockers step. See rule 309, “Declare Blockers Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Universal Tournament Rules</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The DCI Universal Tournament Rules (<del class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre11">www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home</strong></del>) cover tournament play for all DCI-sanctioned games, including the <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> game.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Unless</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Some cards use the phrase “[Do something] unless you [do something else].” This means the same thing as “You may [do something else]. If you don’t, [do something].”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Untap</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">To untap a tapped card, rotate it back to the upright position. See also Tap, Tapped, and Untapped.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Untap Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The untap step is the first step of the beginning phase. All permanents controlled by the active player normally untap at this time. See rule 302, “Untap Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Untapped</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A permanent that’s upright is untapped. Tapping permanents shows that they’ve been used. Permanents untap during their controllers’ untap steps. See also Tap, Tapped, and Untap.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Upkeep Step</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The upkeep step is the second step of the beginning phase. Some cards have abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step; such an ability is informally called an “upkeep cost” or an “upkeep effect.” An upkeep cost is usually written in the form “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may [pay cost]. If you don’t, sacrifice [this card].” These are normal triggered abilities-there are no special rules for them. See rule 303, “Upkeep Step.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Vanguard and Avatars</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The <em class="calibre9">Vanguard™</em> supplements consist of oversized placards and online avatars that modify the game. A <em class="calibre9">Vanguard </em>placard or avatar is selected before the game begins, adjusting a player’s starting and maximum hand size and starting life total. A <em class="calibre9">Vanguard </em>placard or avatar has no color or type, and it can’t be affected by spells or abilities.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Vigilance</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare attackers step. Attacking doesn’t cause creatures with vigilance to tap. See rule 502.14, “Vigilance.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">sWall is a creature type with no particular rules meaning. Many older cards with the Wall creature type have received errata so that they also have the defender ability. Many older cards that referred to the Wall creature type also have errata. Updated wordings for all cards are available in the Oracle card reference.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Win the Game</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A game immediately ends when a player wins. See rule 102, “Winning and Losing.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">World</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">World is a supertype that normally applies to enchantments.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has been a permanent with the world supertype for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners’ graveyards. In the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This “world rule” is a state-based effect. See rule 420.5.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">If a world permanent’s types or subtypes change, this doesn’t change its supertypes. The permanent will still be a world permanent.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">X</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">If a cost has an “{X}” in it, the value of X must be announced as part of playing the spell or ability. (See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”) While the spell or ability is on the stack, the {X} in its mana cost equals the amount announced as part of playing the spell or ability. If a card in any other zone has {X} in its mana cost, the amount is treated as 0. If you’re playing a spell that has {X} in its mana cost and an effect lets you play it without paying any cost that includes X, the only legal choice for X is 0. This does not apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule 409, “Playing Spells and Activated Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In triggered abilities, X is defined when the ability resolves. It may be defined by the text of the ability, by a keyword ability of the card, or by the trigger event. See rule 410, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”</div>
      <div class="paragraph">In other cases, X is defined by the text of a spell or ability. If X isn’t defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses the value of X. All Xs on an object have the same value.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Y, Z</div>
      <div class="paragraph">See X.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">You, Your</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who played the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered. See also Controller, Owner.</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Zone</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A zone is any place that <strong class="calibre11">Magic</strong> cards can be during a game. See rule 217, “Zones.”</div>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <h5 class="subtitle">Zone-Change Triggers</h5>
      <br class="calibre1"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The most common types of zone-change triggers are comes-into-play triggers and leaves-play triggers. See rule 410.10.</div>

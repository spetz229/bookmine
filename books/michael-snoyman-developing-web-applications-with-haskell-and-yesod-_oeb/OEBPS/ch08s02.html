<div class="book" title="Kinds of Forms"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect18_d1e3733" class="calibre1"></a>Kinds of Forms</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Before jumping into the types themselves, we should begin with an overview of the different
   kinds of forms. There are three categories:</p><div class="book"><dl class="book"><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">Applicative</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">These are the most commonly used (it’s what appeared in the synopsis). Applicative
            gives us some nice properties of letting error messages coalesce together and keep a
            very high-level, declarative approach. (For more information on applicative code, see
              <a class="ulink" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applicative_functor">the Haskell
              wiki</a>.)</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">Monadic</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">A more powerful alternative to applicative. While this allows you more flexibility,
            it does so at the cost of being more verbose. Useful if you want to create forms that
            don’t fit into the standard two-column look.</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">Input</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">Used only for receiving input. Does not generate any HTML for receiving the user input.
     Useful for interacting with existing forms.</p></dd></dl></div><p class="calibre7">In addition, there are a number of different variables that come into play for each form and
   field you will want to set up:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Is the field required or optional?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Should it be submitted with GET or POST?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Does it have a default value, or not?</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">An overriding goal is to minimize the number of field definitions and let them work in as
      many contexts as possible. One result of this is that we end up with a few extra words for
      each field. In the synopsis, you may have noticed things like <code class="literal">areq</code> and that extra <code class="literal">Nothing</code> parameter. We’ll
      cover why all of those exist in the course of this chapter, but for now realize that by making
      these parameters explicit, we are able to reuse the individual fields (like <code class="function">intField</code>) in many different ways.</p><p class="calibre7">A quick note on naming conventions. Each form type has a one-letter prefix (A, M, and I)
      that is used in a few places, such as saying MForm. We also use req and opt to mean required
      and optional. Combining these, we create a required applicative field with <code class="literal">areq</code>, or an optional input field with <code class="literal">iopt</code>.</p></div></div>

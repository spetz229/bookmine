Some of them only affect the
            transfer of data between the server and client, and should not affect the application at
            all. For example, <code class="literal">Accept-Encoding</code> informs the server which compression
            schemes the client understands, and <code class="literal">Host</code> informs the server which
            virtual host to serve up.</p><p class="calibre7">Other headers <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre4">do</em></span> affect the application, but are automatically read by
            Yesod. For example, the <code class="literal">Accept-Language</code> header specifies which human
            language (English, Spanish, German, Swiss-German) the client prefers. See the i18n chapter
            for details on how this header is used.</p></div></div>

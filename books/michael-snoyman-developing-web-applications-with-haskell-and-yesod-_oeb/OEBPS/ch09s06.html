      consider this an escape hatch to perform whatever actions we want: statelessness in web
      applications is a virtue, and we should respect it whenever possible. However, there are
      specific cases where it is vital to retain some state.</p><p class="calibre7">The session API in Yesod is very simple. It provides a key-value store, and a few
            convenience functions built on top for common use cases. If used properly, with small
            payloads, sessions should be an unobtrusive part of your web development.</p></div></div>

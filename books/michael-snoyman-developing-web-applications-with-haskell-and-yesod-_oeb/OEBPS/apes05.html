      the status code, the response headers, and the response body. The first two are
      straightforward; let’s discuss the body.</p><p class="calibre7">The <code class="literal">Response</code> type has a type variable to allow the response body to be of
   multiple types. If you want to use <code class="literal">http-conduit</code>’s streaming interface, you want
   this to be a <code class="literal">Source</code>. For the simple interface, it will be a lazy
    <code class="literal">ByteString</code>. One thing to note is that, even though we use a lazy
    <code class="literal">ByteString</code>, <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre4">the entire response is held in memory</em></span>. In other words, we
   perform no lazy I/O in this package.</p><div class="tip" title="Note"><h3 class="title3">Note</h3><p class="calibre7">The <code class="literal">conduit</code> package does provide a lazy module which would allow you to
   read this value in lazily, but like any lazy I/O, it’s a bit unsafe, and definitely
   non-deterministic. If you need it though, you can use it.</p></div></div></div>

Let’s say you have an
   application for selling turtles. You’re going to use the word “turtle” in multiple places, like
   “You have added 4 turtles to your cart.” and “You have purchased 4 turtles, congratulations!” As
   a programmer, you’ll immediately notice the code reuse potential: we have the phrase “4 turtles”
   twice. So you might structure your message file as:</p><a id="I_programlisting5_d1e8110" class="firstname"></a><pre class="programlistinghaskell">AddStart: You have added
AddEnd: to your cart.
PurchaseStart: You have purchased
PurchaseEnd: , congratulations!
Turtles count@Int: #{show count} #{plural "turtle" "turtles"}</pre><p class="calibre7">STOP RIGHT THERE! This is all well and good from a programming perspective, but
   translations are <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> programming. There are a many things that could go wrong
   with this, such as:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Some languages might put “to your cart” before “You have added.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Maybe “added” will be constructed differently depending whether you added 1 or more
    turtles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">There are a bunch of whitespace issues as well.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">So the general rule is: translate entire phrases, not just words.</p></div></div>

      application. They are all optional, and provide sensible defaults. By using built-in Yesod
      constructs like <code class="literal">defaultLayout</code> and <code class="literal">getMessage</code>, you’ll get a consistent look-and-feel throughout your site, including
      pages automatically generated by Yesod such as error pages and authentication.</p><p class="calibre7">We haven’t covered all the methods in the Yesod typeclass in this chapter. For a full
      listing of methods available, you should consult the Haddock documentation.</p></div></div>

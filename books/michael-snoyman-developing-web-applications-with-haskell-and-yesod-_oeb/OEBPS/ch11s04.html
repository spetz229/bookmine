This backend combines Warp and QtWebkit to create an executable that a user simply double-clicks. This can be a convenient way to provide an offline version of your application.</p><p class="calibre7">One of the very nice conveniences of Yesod for this is that your templates are all compiled into the executable, and thus do not need to be distributed with your application. Static files do, however.</p><div class="tip" title="Note"><h3 class="title3">Note</h3><p class="calibre7">There’s actually support for embedding your static files directly in the executable as
        well; see the <code class="function">yesod-static</code> docs for more
        details.</p></div><p class="calibre7">A similar approach, without requiring the QtWebkit library, is <code class="function">wai-handler-launch</code>, which launches a Warp server and then opens up the user’s
      default web browser. There’s a little trickery involved here: in order to know that the user
      is still using the site, <code class="literal">wai-handler-launch</code> inserts a
      “ping” JavaScript snippet to every HTML page it serves. If <code class="literal">wai-handler-launch</code> doesn’t receive a ping for two minutes, it
      shuts down.</p></div></div>

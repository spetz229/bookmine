The layout
   is actually broken up into two files:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre4">templates/default-layout-wrapper.hamlet</em> contains
          just the basic shell of a page. This file is interpreted as plain Hamlet, not as a
          Widget,
          and therefore cannot refer to other widgets, embed i18n strings, or add extra
          CSS/JS.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre4">templates/default-layout.hamlet</em> is where you would put the bulk of your
    page. You <span class="bold"><strong class="bold">must</strong></span> remember to include the <code class="literal">widget</code> value in the page, as that
    contains the per-page contents. This file is interpreted as a Widget.</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Also, since default-layout is included via the <code class="literal">widgetFile</code> function,
   any Lucius, Cassius, or Julius files named <em class="calibre4">default-layout.*</em> will
   automatically be included as well.</p></div></div>

But
    the fact is that, eventually, you need to serve your app somehow, and odds are that you’ll need
    to be the one to set it up.</p><p class="calibre7">There are some promising initiatives in the Haskell web community towards making deployment easier. In the future, we may even have a service that allows you to deploy your app with a single command.</p><p class="calibre7">But we’re not there yet. And even if we were, such a solution will never work for everyone.
    This chapter covers the different options you have for deployment, and gives some general
    recommendations on what you should choose in different situations.</p><div class="book" title="Compiling"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect111_d1e5999" class="calibre1"></a>Compiling</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">First things first: how do you build your production application? If you’re using the
      scaffolded site, it’s as simple as <code class="literal">cabal build</code>. I also
      recommend cleaning beforehand to make sure there is no cached information, so a simple
      combination to build your executable is:</p><a id="I_programlisting11_d1e6010" class="firstname"></a><pre class="programlistinghaskell">cabal clean &amp;&amp; cabal configure &amp;&amp; cabal build</pre></div></div></div>

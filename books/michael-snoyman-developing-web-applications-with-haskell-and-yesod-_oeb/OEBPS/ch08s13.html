   a nice user interface with an easy-to-use API. Monadic forms give you more power, but are harder
   to use. Input forms are intended when you just want to read data from the user, not generate the
   input widgets.</p><p class="calibre7">There are a number of different <code class="literal">Field</code>s provided by Yesod out-of-the-box. In
   order to use these in your forms, you need to indicate the kind of form and whether the field is
   required or optional. The result is six helper functions: <code class="literal">areq</code>,
    <code class="literal">aopt</code>, <code class="literal">mreq</code>, <code class="literal">mopt</code>, <code class="literal">ireq</code>, and
    <code class="literal">iopt</code>.</p><p class="calibre7">Forms have significant power available. They can automatically insert JavaScript to help
      you leverage nicer UI controls, such as a jQuery UI date picker. Forms are also fully
      i18n-ready, so you can support a global community of users. And when you have more specific
      needs, you can slap on some validation functions to an existing field, or write a new one from
      scratch.</p></div></div>

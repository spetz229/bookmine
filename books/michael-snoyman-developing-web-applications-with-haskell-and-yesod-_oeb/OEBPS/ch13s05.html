            The advantage of understanding how Yesod’s monads interact is to be able to produce
            cleaner, more modular code. Being able to perform arbitrary actions in a <code class="literal">Widget</code> can be a powerful tool, and understanding how
            Persistent and your <code class="literal">Handler</code> code interact can help
            you make more informed design decisions in your app.</p></div></div>

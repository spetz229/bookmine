<div class="book" title="What’s in a Widget?"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect15_d1e2005" class="calibre1"></a>What’s in a Widget?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">At a very superficial level, an HTML document is just a bunch of nested tags. This is the
      approach most HTML generation tools take: you simply define hierarchies of tags and are done
      with it. But let’s imagine that I want to write a component of a page for displaying the
      navbar. I want this to be “plug and play”: I simply call the function at the right
      time, and the navbar is inserted at the correct point in the hierarchy.</p><p class="calibre7">This is where our superficial HTML generation breaks down. Our navbar likely consists of
      some CSS and JavaScript in addition to HTML. By the time we call the navbar function, we have
      already rendered the <code class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, so it is too late to
      add a new <code class="literal">&lt;style&gt;</code> tag for our CSS declarations. Under
      normal strategies, we would need to break up our navbar function into three parts: HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript, and make sure that we always call all three pieces.</p><p class="calibre7">Widgets take a different approach. Instead of viewing an
            HTML document as a monolithic tree of tags, widgets see a number of
            distinct components in the page. In particular:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">The title</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">External stylesheets</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">External JavaScript</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">CSS declarations</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">JavaScript code</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Arbitrary <code class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</code> content</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre7">Arbitrary <code class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</code> content</p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Different components have different semantics. For example,
            there can only be one title, but there can be multiple external
            scripts and stylesheets. However, those external scripts and
            stylesheets should only be included once. Arbitrary head and body
            content, on the other hand, has no limitation (someone may want to
            have five lorem ipsum blocks after all).</p><p class="calibre7">The job of a widget is to hold onto these disparate components and apply proper logic
            for combining different widgets together. This consists of things like taking the first
            title set and ignoring others, filtering duplicates from the list of external scripts
            and stylesheets, and concatenating head and body content.</p></div></div>

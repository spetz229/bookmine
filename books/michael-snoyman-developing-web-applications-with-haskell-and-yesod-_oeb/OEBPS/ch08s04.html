      but I’m sure the type signature said <code class="literal">MForm</code>. Shouldn’t it be
      Monadic?” That’s true, the final form we produced was monadic. But what really happened
      is that we converted an applicative form to a monadic one.</p><p class="calibre7">Again, our goal is to reuse code as much as possible, and minimize the number of
   functions in the API. And Monadic forms are more powerful than Applicative, if more clumsy, so
   anything that can be expressed in an Applicative form could also be expressed in a Monadic form.
   There are two core functions that help out with this: <code class="literal">aformToForm</code> converts any
   applicative form to a monadic one, and <code class="literal">formToAForm</code> converts certain kinds of
   monadic forms to applicative forms.</p><p class="calibre7">“But wait <span class="bold"><strong class="bold">another</strong></span> minute,” you insist.
      “I didn’t see any <code class="literal">aformToForm</code>!” Also true. The
        <code class="literal">renderDivs</code> function takes care of that for us.</p></div></div>

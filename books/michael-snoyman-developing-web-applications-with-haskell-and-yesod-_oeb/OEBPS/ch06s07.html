<div class="book" title="Some Simple Settings"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="I_sect16_d1e2939" class="calibre1"></a>Some Simple Settings</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Not everything in the Yesod typeclass is complicated. Some methods are simple functions.
      Let’s just go through the list:</p><div class="book"><dl class="book"><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">encryptKey</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">Yesod uses client-side sessions, which are stored in encrypted,
            cryptographically-hashed cookies. Well, as long as you provide an encryption key. If
            this function returns Nothing, then sessions are disabled. This can be a useful
            optimization on sites that don’t need session facilities, as it avoids an
            encrypt/decrypt pair on each request.</p><div class="tip" title="Note"><h3 class="title3">Note</h3><p class="calibre7">The combination of encryption and hashing guarantees two properties: the session
                payload is tamper-proof, and is opaque. Encryption without hashing would allow a
                user to randomly change the cookie data and still have it accepted by the server,
                while hashing without encryption would allow inspection of the data.</p></div></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">clientSessionDuration</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">How long a session should last for. By default, this is two hours.</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">sessionIpAddress</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">By default, sessions are tied to an individual IP address. If your users are sitting behind
     a proxy server, this can cause trouble when their IP suddenly changes. This setting lets you
     disable this security feature.</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">cookiePath</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">What paths within your current domain to set cookies for. The default is
            “/”, and will almost always be correct. One exception might be when you’re
            serving from a subpath within a domain (like our wiki example above).</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">maximumContentLength</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">To prevent Denial of Server (DoS) attacks, Yesod will limit the size of request
            bodies. Some of the time, you’ll want to bump that limit for some routes (e.g., a file
            upload page). This is where you’d do that.</p></dd><dt class="calibre9"><span class="firstname">yepnopeJs</span></dt><dd class="calibre10"><p class="calibre7">You can specify the location of the <a class="ulink" href="http://yepnopejs.com/">yepnope</a> JavaScript library. If this is given, then yepnope will be used to
            asynchronously load all of the JavaScript on your page.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>

   error-prone, untyped data access, or manually writing boilerplate marshal code, you can rely on
   Persistent to automate the process for you.</p><p class="calibre7">The goal is to provide everything you need, <span class="firstname"><em class="calibre4">most</em></span> of the time. For the
      times when you need something a bit more powerful, Persistent gives you direct access to the
      underlying data store, so you can write whatever five-way joins you want.</p><p class="calibre7">Persistent integrates directly into the general Yesod workflow. Not only do helper
      packages like <code class="literal">yesod-persistent</code> provide a nice layer, but
      packages like <code class="literal">yesod-form</code> and <code class="literal">yesod-auth</code> also leverage Persistentâ€™s features as well.</p></div></div>

<h2 id="sec.node.summary" class="calibre13">6.5 Client, Server—What’s the Difference?</h2>
<p id="N1429F" class="calibre5">
      We’ve only scratched the surface of Node.js in this chapter. Despite its youth, Node is already a powerful framework with a thriving ecosystem, making CoffeeScript a viable language well beyond the browser.
    </p>
<p id="N142A2" class="calibre5">
      Node has attracted a lot of hype in part because of its evented architecture, built around nonblocking IO, which makes it an efficient alternative to web platforms that rely on multithreading. But perhaps more exciting for the code-monkey masses is that we can now write for our client and server in the same language and even migrate code from one to the other. The techniques this allows are only beginning to be explored, ranging from testing to templating to validation. Who knows what’s next?
      </p>
<p id="N142A8" class="calibre5">
      That, alas, is beyond the realm of this humble book, which I hereby congratulate you on completing! You’ve now learned to apply CoffeeScript to both front- and back-end environments, using its power to provide shorter, clearer code than even the greatest JavaScripter could produce (nothing personal, Resig).

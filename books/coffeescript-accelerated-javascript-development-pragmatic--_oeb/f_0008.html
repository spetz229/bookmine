<p id="N10241" class="calibre5"> We’ll start our journey by discovering the various ways that we can compile and run CoffeeScript code. Then we’ll delve into the nuts and bolts of the language. Each chapter will introduce concepts and conventions that tie into our ongoing project (see the next section). </p>
<p id="N10244" class="calibre5"> To master CoffeeScript, you’ll need to know how it works with the rest of the JavaScript universe. So after learning the basics of the language, we’ll take brief tours of jQuery, the world’s most popular JavaScript framework, and Node.js, an exciting new project that lets you run JavaScript outside of the browser. While we won’t go into great depth with either tool, we’ll see that they go with CoffeeScript like chocolate and peanut butter. And by combining their powers, we’ll be able to write an entire multiplayer game in just a few hours. </p>
<p id="N10247" class="calibre5"> No matter what level you’re at, be sure to do the exercises at the end of each chapter. They’re designed to be quick yet challenging, illustrating some of the most common pitfalls CoffeeScripters fall into. Try to solve them on your own before you check the answers in Appendix A, <a href="f_0060.html#app.answers">​<em class="emph">Answers to Exercises</em>​</a>. </p>
<p id="N1024D" class="calibre5"> The code presented in this book, as well as errata and discussion forums, can be found on its PragProg page: <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tbcoffee/coffeescript">http://pragprog.com/titles/tbcoffee/coffeescript</a>. </p>

    This cheat sheet summarizes most of the keywords and operators that CoffeeScript provides in terms of their JavaScript equivalents. In the tables below, <span class="emph">Symbol</span> refers to the preferred style in CoffeeScript, while <span class="emph">Alias</span> refers to a less-preferred alternative. Often, the alias is the same in JavaScript. For instance, <code class="cf">or</code> is recommended over <code class="cf">||</code> in CoffeeScript, but both are allowed.
  </p>
<p id="N14A9C" class="calibre5">
    Occasionally, the JavaScript code given is slightly simplified and differs from the CoffeeScript in some edge cases; these are clarified in notes at the foot of each table.
  </p>
<p id="N14A9F" class="calibre5">
    Symbols that are unchanged from JavaScript, such as the math and bitwise operators, are not mentioned here.

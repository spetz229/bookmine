<p class="calibre24">Primary thanks go to a succession of teachers of the art of living: Lao Tse, Gautama Buddha, G. I. Gurdjieff, Carl Jung, Krishnamurti, Aldous Huxley, Philip Kapleau, Robert Aitken, Nechung Rinpoche, Ram Dass, and Kaila Kukla. For getting the book out there, however, I have to thank my agent, Robert Mackwood. What they say is true: you need a good agent. I tried and failed to get the attention of publishers for years before Robert came along and sold the book to two of them within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Having two simultaneous publishers— Doubleday in Canada and McGraw-Hill in the US—has been an interesting experience. For one thing, it seems that there are national differences in punctuation practices: one copy editor deleted most of my commas, while the other one nearly doubled their number. But the main consequence <a class="calibre23"></a>of my dual literary citizenship has been that it brought me into contact with two of the most helpful and most pleasant people that I’ve ever worked with—my Canadian editor, Nick Massey-Garrison, and my American editor, Holly McGuire. Their enthusiasm and support have been unflagging. They’ve lavished my project with care as though it were their own. Holly sent me about a dozen e-mails on the precise wording of the subtitle; and Nick, who seems to have understood the book better than I have, made suggestions that led to major structural improvements. Thanks, Nick and Holly.</p>

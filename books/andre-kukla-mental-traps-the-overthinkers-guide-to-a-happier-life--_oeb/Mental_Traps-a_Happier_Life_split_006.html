The opposite error of doing too little receives far more attention. But too much is also a mistake. There’s a certain amount of work appropriate to each of life’s tasks. If we do too little, we fall short of the goal. And if we do too much, we squander our resources.</p>
<p class="calibre22">A comparison with persistence will help to define the character of both traps. When we amplify, the end we are working toward remains valuable, but our work doesn’t advance us toward it. When we persist, our work may be superbly effective in moving us toward the end, but we have no reason for going there. We persist when we continue to play a game that has become tedious. We amplify when we take too long to move in a game that we still care about.</p>
<p class="calibre22">It’s amplificatory to rehearse a speech so often that our words become dull and lifeless, or to spend a hundred dollars to make the projection of <a class="calibre23"></a>our annual expenditures more precise by ten dollars, or to overpack for a trip because we wish to be prepared for the most unlikely contingencies—what if we’re invited to a formal ball in the midst of the Papuan jungle? Making more money than can be spent is an amplification that has consumed some lives in their entirety.</p>
<p class="calibre22">The mark of amplification is that the means exceed what is necessary to accomplish the end. Whether we are amplifying therefore depends on what we’re trying to accomplish. Making more money than we can spend is a trap if our aim is to be able to buy what we want. But the same activity may be fully in accord with our values if we engage in it for the pleasure of playing the money game. A man’s prolonging sexual foreplay longer than strictly necessary to ejaculate doesn’t count as amplification—unless his only interest is in reproduction. Even swatting a fly with a sledgehammer may be appropriate if we feel the need to exercise. On the other hand, it’s unlikely that we overpack for the sake of exercise or out of a fascination with the packing game. Still, it isn’t unheard of.</p>
<p class="calibre22">There are tasks that provide literally endless opportunities for amplification. However much <a class="calibre23"></a>we do in the service of these goals, it’s still possible to do more. If we want to be rich, there’s always more money to be made. We can always rehearse a speech one more time. If we keep looking, there’s always a chance that we’ll find a higher-scoring Scrabble word. And when we make a decision, there are always additional factors that may be taken into account. Having compared the academic reputation, athletic prowess, and architectural merits of several universities, we may also essay a guess as to where we’re most likely to find romance. Having discussed our options with a dozen people, we can always solicit the opinion of a thirteenth.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Of course there is a law of diminishing returns. Our second million dollars may not make enough difference in our life to be worth the trouble of making it. And our deliberations about schools must eventually reach levels of such minute significance or vast uncertainty that it isn’t worth the effort to carry the analysis further. This is the point where amplification begins.</p>
<p class="calibre22">We’re sometimes persuaded to go beyond this point by the thought that we can never really be sure that more work will prove to be useless. For all we know, one more minute of looking at the <a class="calibre23"></a>Scrabble board will reveal a place for our seven-letter word. The thirteenth informant may give us vastly better advice than the previous twelve. But if this line of reasoning is sound after twelve informants, it’s equally sound after thirteen. The next bit of effort may indeed be crucial—and so may the next bit after that, and the one after that. By this argument we’re led to the conclusion that we should study the Scrabble board forever and consult with every person in the world about our options.</p>
<p class="calibre22">The fallacy of such thinking is that it’s a cost-benefit analysis that leaves the cost entirely out of account. To be sure, it’s always possible that we may profit from more work. But it’s also certain that more work will cost us time and effort that we could choose to spend otherwise. The question is not whether more work on the present activity might benefit us, but <em class="calibre9">whether it’s likelier to benefit us than the same amount of work invested elsewhere.</em> This is the criterion for when to quit.</p>
<p class="calibre22">The application of this criterion is clearer in some cases than in others. At one extreme are situations where the cost of more work actually exceeds the potential benefit. Suppose we have <a class="calibre23"></a>to make nine different stops on a shopping expedition. Unless we plan a route beforehand, we’ll end up needlessly retracing our steps. But if we try to work out the very best route by estimating the time it would take for all <span><span class="calibre26">362</span></span>,<span><span class="calibre26">880</span></span> permutations of nine stops, our calculations will surely take longer than the amount of traveling time saved by the result. This is the most flagrant type of amplification. We don’t even need to inquire whether there are more profitable investments for our time. We would do better not to invest at all. This venture is a dead loss.</p>
<p class="calibre22">On the other hand, we can’t say precisely when our deliberations about universities turn into amplification. But we should at least know to quit if it finally becomes clear that we could be doing something more valuable. Even then we may be making a mistake. The very next bit of work might indeed have spelled the difference between success and failure. Freedom from mental traps is not omniscience. But we’re more likely to go wrong when we are trapped.</p>
<p class="calibre25">Work may be amplified literally to infinity in either of two directions—horizontally or vertically. In <em class="calibre9">horizontal amplification</em>, we think of more <a class="calibre23"></a>and more subtasks to perform in the service of achieving our objective—more people to interview, another rehearsal of our speech, another minute to look for a Scrabble word. Each additional subtask advances our cause less than the last. The value of our work never quite gets down to zero, however. Thus we continue to think that we are usefully employed. The problem is that there are other worthy ventures in life besides this Scrabble game.</p>
<p class="calibre22"><em class="calibre9">Vertical amplification</em> is more intriguing. Here the completion of the major task requires the prior completion of a subtask, whose completion in turn requires the prior completion of a sub-subtask, and so on. Wishing to convey our meaning precisely when we speak, we begin with a prefatory qualification designed to allay misunderstanding:</p>
<div class="calibre7"><blockquote class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">
<p class="calibre24">Not that I insist on this myself, but—</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre24">In the midst of our qualification, it occurs to us that the qualification may itself be misunderstood. So we launch into a qualification of the qualification:</p>
<div class="calibre7"><blockquote class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">
<p class="calibre24"><a class="calibre23"></a>Not that I insist on this myself—nor on any of the other options, for that matter—but—</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre24">Of course, the qualification of the qualification is also liable to certain misconstructions:</p>
<div class="calibre7"><blockquote class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">
<p class="calibre24">Not that I insist on this myself—nor on any of the other options, for that matter—of course I do have preferences—but—</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre5"> </div>
<p class="calibre24">In this way we’re led backward away from the goal of deciding on a pizza to considerations of the origin of social contracts, the meaning of life, and the definition of “definition.”</p>
<p class="calibre22">Or suppose we try to decide whether to buy a modest but affordable cottage or the sumptuous mansion of our dreams. We reason that our choice depends largely on how financially secure we expect our future to be. But we can’t know whether our financial future is secure until we know how likely it is that our particular sector of the economy will flourish in the long term. The probability that our sector will flourish depends in turn on energy prices. Energy prices will depend on our foreign policy. Our foreign policy will depend on the results of the next election. <a class="calibre23"></a>The next election will be decided by attitudes toward gay rights …</p>
<p class="calibre22">The result of vertical amplification is a paradoxical movement further and further away from the goal. The more we work, the more there is left to do before we’re finished. A bottomless abyss opens up between the beginning and the end.</p>
<p class="calibre22">In its fullest flower, amplification unfolds in both the horizontal and the vertical directions at once. The task calls forth endless subtasks, each of which requires endless sub-subtasks for their completion, and so on. Can such monstrous mental growths really exist? Where else does chronic indecision come from? If indecision were nothing more than finding the alternatives exactly equal, we would simply flip a coin and be done with it. There would be no reason to <em class="calibre9">abide</em> in the undecided state. We remain undecided because we don’t know whether the alternatives are equal or not. We can’t arrive at their values at all. We’re lost in endless calculations.</p>
<p class="calibre22"><em class="calibre9">Accumulation</em> is a particularly insidious form of vertical amplification. We fall into this subtle trap when the goal admits of unlimited degrees of realization. Getting pregnant proverbially does not admit of degrees—either we are, or we aren’t. <a class="calibre23"></a>Nor does coming to a decision—having decided, the job is done. But if we aim at wealth, fame, wisdom, power, or virtue, there is no absolute token of attainment. A millionaire is wealthy compared to the average person. But millionaires are more apt to look to multimillionaires for their standard of comparison. The same relativity affects our judgments of wisdom, power, and virtue. If a turnip were elevated to the station of the average man, it would suppose itself to be a god.</p>
<p class="calibre22">But only for a moment. In fact, no amount of power can make us <em class="calibre9">feel</em> powerful for very long, nor does any amount of recognition continue to be experienced as great fame. The attainment of any degree of these indefinite goals, rather than signaling an end to our striving, inevitably becomes the occasion for raising our standard of achievement. Every step forward makes the goal move one step back. Thus we can never arrive. Many lives are given up entirely to these fruitless journeys.</p>
<p class="calibre25">The curious phenomenon of <em class="calibre9">repetition</em> occurs in amplification, as well as in several other traps. In all cases the outward manifestation is the same. Having finished our work, we proceed to do it all <a class="calibre23"></a>again. When it’s a case of amplification, we repeat in order to achieve a greater and greater degree of certainty that the work is indeed complete. After all, it’s always possible that we’ve overlooked something. Even if we recall having done everything, our memory may be mistaken. So we do it all again. But we don’t thereby arrive at a state of <em class="calibre9">absolute</em> certainty. There’s still room for improvement. So we do it a third time … Repetition is a horizontally infinite amplification.</p>
<p class="calibre22">We make all our preparations for a trip. We pack, arrange for the feeding of pets and the watering of plants, disconnect the telephone, make sure that the faucets are shut, lock the windows and the doors … Everything has been attended to. But perhaps there’s something we’ve overlooked. Perhaps we’ve forgotten to pack the toothbrushes. So we review our arrangements one by one: toothbrushes, pets, plants, windows, doors … But we can as well commit an oversight the second time around as the first. The situation remains essentially unchanged. Thus if we were inclined to review our arrangements before, we’re going to be equally inclined to do so now: toothbrushes, pets, plants, windows, doors … Again and again we are returned to the same starting <a class="calibre23"></a>point. We drive off to the airport with our thoughts running along the same endless circle: toothbrushes, pets, plants, windows, doors … toothbrushes, pets, plants, windows, doors …</p>
<p class="calibre22">The rationalization of repetition is that with each time around we diminish the probability of error. Now this is undoubtedly true in some cases. The chance of making an arithmetical error is considerably reduced if we repeat the calculation and obtain the same result a second time. Even so, we have to take the law of diminishing returns into account. Every review of our work adds less to our confidence than the previous one. Whether it’s worthwhile to review ten times, once, or not at all evidently depends on the cost of conducting the review in comparison to its ever-diminishing benefit. Before we go over a hundred canceled checks a second time to reconcile an eleven-cent discrepancy in our balance, we might ask ourselves whether we would be willing to reconcile someone <em class="calibre9">else’s</em> checkbook for the payment of eleven cents. If not, it might be wiser to subtract the sum from our balance and find something more valuable to do.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Moreover, it isn’t always true that every repetition diminishes uncertainty, even by a hair’s <a class="calibre23"></a>breadth. Often we already <em class="calibre9">have</em> the highest degree of certainty that is humanly attainable. In that case, repetition accomplishes nothing at all. For example, if our enterprise involves more than a few steps, it’s impossible to perceive all the stages of the work at once. When we turn to selecting the toiletries for our trip, the clothes we’ve packed are no longer before us. We have to rely on our memory that when we <em class="calibre9">did</em> attend to the clothes, we judged that phase of the work to be complete. If now we try to recapture the certainty of immediate perception by reviewing the earlier stage of the work, we simply lose sight of the later stage. The greatest attainable certainty is already reached when we recall that we <em class="calibre9">once</em> judged the other stages of the work to be done. We can no longer have the direct evidence of our senses to make this judgment now. But there’s nothing to be done about it. No amount of shuttling back and forth between the earlier and the later stages of the work will diminish our residual uncertainty.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Nor will it help to write everything down or to have someone follow us everywhere with a video camera. For what has been written or videotaped can be read or viewed only one item at a time. By the time we get to the last items, the <a class="calibre23"></a>first ones will already be out of mind. We are therefore back to where we started, relying on our recollection that everything seemed to be in order when it was before us. Making a list may help us to achieve this maximum of attainable confidence. But if we have it already and make a list in the hope of arriving closer to the certainty of immediate perception, we fall into a trap. We will find ourselves reading and rereading our list to make certain that everything is on it, just as we would mentally repeat our activities without a list. The trap is the same. Only the medium of expression has been changed.</p>
<p class="calibre22">It’s especially common to fall into the trap of repetition when the goal’s attainment or non-attainment is difficult to confirm. When we go to the corner store, we feel very little need to retrace our steps in order to establish that we have come to the right place. But if we want to be loved by another, our attainment may not be so clear even after we’ve gathered all the evidence we can. But if we <em class="calibre9">have</em> gathered all the evidence we can, there’s nothing more to be done—except to repeat. This is why some spouses ask for the same proofs and declarations of their mates’ affection again and again. And a jealous husband may literally retrace <a class="calibre23"></a>his wife’s steps again and again in a vain attempt to eliminate every chance of infidelity.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Whatever their need might be, such people don’t sufficiently appreciate the sheer <em class="calibre9">uselessness</em> of their actions. Sometimes the available evidence is simply inadequate for our purposes. That may be unfortunate. But nothing is accomplished by going over and over the same ground.</p>
<p class="calibre25">In tracking down the various forms of amplification in everyday life, it’s sometimes useful to stop what we’re doing and ask ourselves whether our work is really necessary in light of our aims. A good time to ask is when we notice that we’re working very hard and not getting much done. But, except when the stakes are large, it isn’t usually a good idea to try to calculate benefits and costs with mathematical precision. In fact, this activity can easily turn into yet another amplification. It’s pointless to engage in prolonged and relentless inquiries into the value of a three-minute task. We would do better to put in the three minutes and be done with it, whether the work is useful or not.</p>
<p class="calibre22">Often we can detect amplifications simply by their feel. As we’ve seen, many amplified tasks <a class="calibre23"></a>have a literally infinite structure. We are returned again and again to where we started, or one thing invariably leads to another. These labyrinthine patterns of thought make us literally dizzy. We feel as though we were on a merry-go-round or falling into a bottomless pit. Sensations of this kind are a surer guide to the trap of amplification than any cost-benefit analysis.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div></div>

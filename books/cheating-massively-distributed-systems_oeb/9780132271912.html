studying offense. You would not know when a run was coming, how to
defend pass patterns, nor when to blitz. In computer systems, as in
football, a defender must be able to think like an attacker. I say
it in my class every semester, you don't want to be the last person
to attack your own system--you should be the first.</p><p class="docText">"The world is quickly going online. While I caution against
online voting, it is clear that online gaming is taking the
Internet by storm. In our new age where virtual items carry real
dollar value, and fortunes are won and lost over items that do not
really exist, the new threats to the intrepid gamer are all too
real. To protect against these hazards, you must understand them,
and this groundbreaking book is the only comprehensive source of
information on how to exploit computer games. Every White Hat
should read it. It's their only hope of staying only one step
behind the bad guys."</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">--Aviel D. Rubin, Ph.D.<br class="calibre15"/>

about virtual-world security. Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw are the
perfect pair to show just how vulnerable these online games can
be."</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">--Cade Metz<br class="calibre15"/>

PC Magazine</p><p class="docText">"If we're going to improve our security practices, frank
discussions like the ones in this book are the only way forward. Or
as the authors of this book might say, when you're facing off
against Heinous Demons of Insecurity, you need experienced
companions, not to mention a Vorpal Sword of Security

new capabilities and to hone existing skills--especially in the Air
Force. The authors turn this simple concept on itself, making games
themselves the subject and target of the 'hacking game,' and along
the way creating a masterly publication that is as meaningful to
the gamer as it is to the serious security system professional.</p><p class="docText">"Massively distributed systems will define the software field of
play for at least the next quarter century. Understanding how they
work is important, but understanding how they can be manipulated is
essential for the security professional. This book provides the
cornerstone for that knowledge."</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">--Daniel McGarvey<br class="calibre15"/>

United States Air Force</span></p><p class="docText">"Like a lot of kids, Gary and I came to computing (and later to
computer security) through games. At first, we were fascinated with
playing games on our Apple ][s, but then became bored with the few
games we could afford. We tried copying each other's games, but ran
up against copy-protection schemes. So we set out to understand
those schemes and how they could be defeated. Pretty quickly, we
realized that it was a lot more fun to disassemble and work around
the protections in a game than it was to play it.</p><p class="docText">"With the thriving economies of today's online games, people not
only have the classic hacker's motivation to understand and bypass
the security of games, but also the criminal motivation of cold,
hard cash. That's a combination that's hard to stop. The first
step, taken by this book, is revealing the techniques that are
being used today."</p><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">--Greg Morrisett, Ph.D.<br class="calibre15"/>

security, you're at a real disadvantage. If you're designing the
massive distributed systems of tomorrow and you don't learn from

software security on a whole new front: attacking an online game.
Newcomers will find it incredibly eye opening and even veterans of
the field will enjoy some of the same old programming mistakes
given brilliant new light in a way that only
massively-multiplayer-supermega-blow-em-up games can deliver.

<h3 id="title-IDA1GC0K" class="docSection1Title">The End User License Agreement</h3>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1466" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1469" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>The EULA is the kind of license typically used for software. It's really a legal contract between the software producer and the end user, stating how the software will be used. EULAs often place restrictions on use and make disclaimers meant to limit liability.</p>
<p class="docText">As you might imagine, there are many different kinds of EULAs. Some require a click to activate (often over the Internet). Some go into force when a CD is taken out of its packaging. Of course, the terms and restrictions in EULAs differ as well.</p>
<p class="docText">Both EULAs and the DMCA are directly relevant to online gamers. Today, the DMCA is being used to uphold restrictions on use placed in the EULA and can now include the requirement to pay and play using the vendor's online service.</p>
<p class="docText">Before you click Agree on a EULA, you must understand what you are agreeing to. The fine print may surprise you.</p>
<p class="docText">A EULA can place all kinds of seemingly strange restrictions on the use of the material being licensed. We'll discuss some of these examples in upcoming subsections.</p>
<ul class="calibre18"><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">A EULA can state where and when you can use the software or that if you install it once, you can never install it again.</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">A EULA can also state that the software is allowed to install a rootkit back door on your computer (see Sony's EULA).</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">A EULA can grant the online service full access to your memory (see Blizzard's EULA).</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">A EULA can grant full access to your hard drive and allow the vendor to download all your files (see Gator's EULA).</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">A EULA can even state that, once you have accepted the EULA, you also accept all future unwritten EULAs that the vendor has yet to release (see Apple Computer's EULA).</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Open-ended, egregious EULAs abound with language like this—and they are very common.</p>
<p class="docText">Some people believe that the idea of EULAs has not been appropriately tested in court and thus the EULAs can't be valid. This is a misunderstanding of contract law. The only way in which EULAs have been challenged successfully in the past has to do with whether the contract terms were objectionable. In some cases, only certain terms are found objectionable. In other cases, they are most certainly not. As a result, EULAs sometimes hold up in court, and other times they don't.</p>

<blockquote class="calibre24">
<p class="docText">As soon as you have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the EULA, this CD will automatically install a small proprietary software program (the "SOFTWARE") onto YOUR COMPUTER. The SOFTWARE is intended to protect the audio files embodied on the CD, and it may also facilitate your use of the DIGITAL CONTENT. Once installed, the SOFTWARE will reside on YOUR COMPUTER until removed or deleted. However, the SOFTWARE will not be used at any time to collect any personal information from you, whether stored on YOUR COMPUTER or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Among other things, the EULA continues by describing the software that is installed (the rootkit). The real question is this: How many people read that EULA and completely understood it before pressing Accept and listening to the CDs they had installed in their CD drives? We bet that number is small.</p>
<p class="docText">Fortunately, this EULA language didn't stop Sony BMG from being sued in at least 15 class action lawsuits after news of the rootkit hit. The class action suit filed in New York district court was settled shortly after it was filed. In the end, the suits were all consolidated, and Sony BMG compensated the buyers of the infected CDs (giving them MP3 files of the songs in exchange) and created uninstall software for the various rootkits it distributed. The company also agreed to continue to halt the manufacture and distribution of CDs with the two rootkits on them. Hopefully the people at Sony learned their lesson.</p>
<p class="docText">One lesson that we can learn is that just because something is in the EULA, that doesn't make it legal. In this case, Sony crossed the line, and the law ended up protecting consumers.</p>

<h2 class="docSidebarTitle">Sony Goes to the Dark Side<sup class="docFootnote2"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch04fn017">[*]</a></sup></h2>
<p class="docText">Sony is really interested in making sure that you don't rip digital copies of its music—so interested that the company will go so far as to root your box to make sure you can't. There are many reasons why this is an awful development. These include the morally questionable use of spyware as a security feature, the fact that malicious hackers can use this spyware to further compromise machines, and the invasion of privacy this poorly conceived security mechanism promulgates. But the worst possible effect of the Sony rootkit spyware may be imposed on your IT staff. Put simply, this mess is going to be hard to clean up.</p>
<p class="docText">Mark Russinovich of Sysinternals discovered that XCP2, a CD protection scheme peddled by British-based First4Internet and licensed and used by Sony/BMG, monitors computer use and disallows users from ripping CDs &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html">http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html</a>&gt;. When an XCP2-protected CD is inserted into a Windows PC, Windows Autorun copies a small piece of software onto the computer. From then on, if the user attempts to rip a protected CD, the software replaces the music with static.</p>
<p class="docText">Copy protection software is nothing new, so what makes this a rootkit? The software deliberately cloaks itself from normal diagnostic tools and some security products by hiding certain processes, rewriting the interrupt address table, and interposing on various kernel-level system calls. This makes XCP2 hard to find. It is also very difficult to remove.</p>
<p class="docText">Running a large network of PCs has always been difficult, but imagine trying to administer a large network of PCs all of which are running "invisible" rootkits. One of the basic ideas that rootkits employ is stealth. That is, they attempt to hide their very existence from system administrators and others responsible for security. This makes rootkits a very dangerous weapon indeed (rootkits are well deserving of their place at the apex of the attacker's toolkit). When supposedly legitimate processes adopt this bad behavior, they make administering a machine almost impossible! That's because finding processes hidden away like XCP2 is difficult and time consuming. Multiply this by the number of machines in your enterprise and you can begin to appreciate the problem.</p>
<p class="docText">But it gets worse. The Sony rootkit technology not only hides the antiripping process, it will hide any specially tagged process just as well. According to Russinovich, XCP2's stealth mechanism will hide any file, directory, Registry key, or process whose name begins with "$sys$". This means that malicious software can take advantage of the existence of the Sony rootkit to avoid detection. In fact, the first malware attempting to take advantage of the Sony rootkit emerged several days after the story <a name="iddle1071" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1465" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1484" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1508" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2291" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>broke. Rumors have also emerged of gamers using the code to hide game hacking programs from the detection system used by the online game World of Warcraft.</p>
<p class="docText">In addition, the Web-based uninstaller trumpeted to the press (and made very difficult to find and use by actual owners of Sony CDs) is linked specifically to one and only one machine. That is, it will uninstall only on one infected PC. Corporate IT will not appreciate that at all. Plus, according to Ed Felten &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/">http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/</a>&gt;, the Web version of the uninstaller opens a serious security hole on any computer that it's run on. Toxic waste, anyone? So corporate IT departments need to first determine whether this invisible software exists on their machines and then safely remove it. Both of these activities are time consuming and may lead to difficulties on some machines.</p>
<p class="docText">XCP2 may also affect a PC's normal operations. The program scans all running processes on the system every two seconds, querying basic information about the files and consuming up to 2% of system resources (due to sloppy coding). Users have reported serious impacts on PCs infected with the XCP2 rootkit, most of which impacts were extremely mysterious until Sony was outed and the source of the problems—music CDs—became clear. Some antivirus mechanisms and personal firewalls apparently go berserk when faced with XCP2.</p>
<p class="docText">According to the <span class="docEmphasis">Washington Post</span>, "a class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of California consumers who may have been harmed by anti-piracy software installed by some Sony music CDs. A second, nationwide class-action lawsuit is expected to be filed against Sony in a New York court." Shame on Sony. Let's hope the right side prevails.</p>

<p class="docText">Remember, just because the EULA names an activity and you (unintentionally) agree to it, that does not make the activity legal. Some EULA clauses have been known to fall in court.</p>
<p class="docText">While we're on the subject, it is also worth noting that the Blizzard EULA has a clause that forbids online sale of items accumulated in the game:</p>

<p class="docText">But the real question is whether EULA allowances like the ones we described are really required to stop software pirates. Are they, or is there more here than meets the eye? You have to admit that the requirement to play online using a given server is a most excellent tactic for curbing piracy. But how do you feel about game companies sifting through personal information on your PC? What do you think about companies mining data on your computer? How do you feel about a video game that installs a rootkit? When is the DMCA and its accompanying sidekick EULA not about copyright protection anymore? These are the sorts of legal questions facing online gamers today.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDARRKEF" class="docSection2Title">Forbidding Reverse Engineering</h4>
<p class="docText">The DMCA expressly forbids reverse engineering for the purposes of defeating copy protection mechanisms. The purpose as stated in the law is to enforce copyright law. The question is whether or not it is legal to reverse <a name="iddle1203" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1473" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1479" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1597" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1601" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1655" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1903" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2037" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2268" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>engineer software such as a game client. Is copyright being violated if a hidden API is exposed? What about faulty security design?</p>
<p class="docText">Note that the DMCA includes exceptions for computer security research in order to protect researchers and academics. Nonetheless, this is a very murky area of law.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDACUKEF" class="docSection2Title">Forbidding Game Hacking</h4>
<p class="docText">No one has yet established a legal definition for game hacking. Nevertheless, hack, cheats, mods, and sometimes even network sniffing are often called out in a EULA or in the terms of use (as we explain soon).</p>
<a name="ch04lev2sec10" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAOUKEF" class="docSection2Title">Property Rights</h4>
<p class="docText">Property rights are another aspect of online gaming in which the law is not yet clear. Though Blizzard tries hard to make things clear through its public posturing, there really is no clear precedent for dealing with virtual property. Blizzard says things like, "The World of Warcraft Terms of Use clearly states that all of the content in World of Warcraft is the property of Blizzard, and Blizzard does not allow 'in game' items to be sold for real money. Accordingly, Blizzard Entertainment will take any and all actions necessary to stop this behavior. Not only do we believe that it is illegal, but it also has the potential to damage the game economy and overall experience for the many thousands of others who play World of Warcraft for fun."<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch04fn13">[13]</a></sup></p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch04fn13" class="pcalibre calibre1">[13]</a></sup> "IGE: Inside the MMO Trading Machine," by Simon Carless (August 25, 2006; see &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060825/carless_03.shtml">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060825/carless_03.shtml</a>&gt;).</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">But a recent lawsuit filed against Linden Lab the purveyors of Second Life, may change all that. Marc Bragg, a lawyer from Pennsylvania, became upset after a virtual land deal went bad and Linden Lab confiscated his virtual property. Of note is the fact that Second Life explicitly allows members to legally own the content they create. This has led to a large online economy with active trading in real estate, clothes, cars, and other pretend stuff.</p>
<p class="docText">Of note in the Second Life case is the technique that Bragg used to accumulate some of his property. He noticed that the Second Life online auction system was using tags in a URL to track which piece of property was being auctioned. By changing the tag (a classic attack described in our <a name="iddle1060" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1078" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1091" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1496" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2133" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2160" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2162" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2163" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2164" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>book <span class="docEmphasis">Exploiting Software</span>), Bragg effectively bid on land not yet up for sale publicly. This should be an interesting case to watch.</p>
<p class="docText">In any case, all of the time and effort you invest in an online game may disappear in a puff of logic if you fall afoul of the game maker.</p>

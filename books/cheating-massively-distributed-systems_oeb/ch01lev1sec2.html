<h3 id="title-IDAEFJLO" class="docSection1Title">The Lure of Cheating in MMORPGs</h3>
<p class="docText">Given the opportunity in life, many people cheat, especially if they believe they will never get caught. The perceived anonymity of the Internet makes cheating even more attractive. Factor in the ability to make some quick cash, and you have a formula for trouble. Money is probably the number one driver for cheating. (<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a> is all about money and online games.)</p>
<p class="docText">Cheating is not always done to make money, however. Even those players who genuinely want to play an online game as intended have reasons to cheat. It takes months of serious playing in an MMORPG to build a character to a sufficiently high level to make gaming fun. For example, training up on a single skill in the game EVE Online can take six months in real time. Leveling up more quickly is another impetus for cheating (especially for busy people with a life outside of gaming). A related impetus is acquiring rare items or the in-game currency to buy them with.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAZFJLO" class="docSection2Title">Cheat Codes</h4>
<p class="docText">Cheating comes in several forms. Sometimes cheating can be as simple as locating your character at a certain spot in the game world where monsters appear in order to kill them every time they show up. Less violently, you can <a name="iddle1269" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1286" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1291" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1368" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2077" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2172" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2246" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>cheat by creating crafts or growing food with your character over and over and over. As we show in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, this kind of cheating gets much more complicated when these activities are automated with programs.</p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes it's hard to draw the line. For example, some people consider the act of writing simple macros to carry out repetitive activities a weak form of cheating. Macros for any number of actions, from scanning the horizon for enemies to aiming and firing, can be found all over the Internet (see &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.cheatcc.com/">http://www.cheatcc.com/</a>&gt; and &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://cheatcodes.com">http://cheatcodes.com</a>&gt; for two examples).</p>
<p class="docText">More powerful macros, like the farming macro we present in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, can basically play the game for you while you do something else. Most gamers agree that using these programs is cheating. For obvious reasons, many hard-core gamers abhor cheating.</p>
<p class="docText">We describe a number of basic cheating techniques in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>. More advanced techniques are the subject of later chapters.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAOJJLO" class="docSection2Title">Criminal Cheating</h4>
<p class="docText">We introduced the notion of professional farmers who create gold and other items to sell to gamers earlier in the chapter. Services that can level up your character for you are also common. While neither of these activities seems like cheating on the face of it, the use of such services often violates a game's terms of use (see <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>). Some people deem these activities criminal, even though there often aren't any specific laws against them. The worst kinds of things that commonly happen involve legal action by game companies against the service providers (who are most often sued for damages and economic hardship). The gamers who take advantage of the services are usually not prosecuted or sued but are simply banned from the game.</p>
<p class="docText">Cheats come closest to actual crime when they are used to make a great deal of money. A large underground economy exists in discovering, exploiting, and then selling cheats to others. Rumors abound in the underground of individuals who make thousands of dollars on a weekend by using a dupe bug (to copy items surreptitiously) and even of small teams making seven figures during the first year of a new game release. Online poker players regularly use databases that track the relative skill of each player, including hands lost and won, and they use this information to find "weak tables" where they can clean house. In at least one case, security researchers at Cigital cracked the shuffling algorithm for an online poker site and were able to predict the complete shuffle and thereby all of the players' hands in advance (see <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>).</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAPKJLO" class="docSection2Title">Turning Bits into Cash: From Exploits to Items</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1024" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1089" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1295" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1431" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1494" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1544" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2174" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2233" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2247" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2294" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>Turning virtual belongings from an MMO into actual real money is very easy. As we show in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, legitimate trading companies like IGE turn a blind eye toward the origin of many items. That means making money from an MMO is as easy as acquiring an item and selling it to a middleman.</p>
<p class="docText">Players can also cut out the middleman and sell directly to each other. A number of gamers traditionally used eBay for this until eBay stopped all trading in virtual items in 2007. A player can auction off a game item on an auction site, get paid into a PayPal account, and then meet the buyer somewhere in the game to give up the item to the buyer's character. Buyer beware (of course).</p>
<p class="docText">Exploits that take advantage of software defects in the game are much more valuable in the underground gaming economy than game currency and virtual items are. These vulnerabilities can be turned into macros and then sold to gold farms or others who use the macros to create wealth. Exploits and defects are like mints for printing money.</p>

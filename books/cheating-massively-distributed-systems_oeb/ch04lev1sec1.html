<h3 id="title-IDAZXQ3R" class="docSection1Title">Legality</h3>
<p class="docText">In the old days of computer gaming, a game came on a CD and ran only on your PC. In that case, legal agreements were set up to limit liability for the game maker and prevent piracy on the part of the gamer. The biggest problem in those days was cracking of the content protection mechanisms and the subsequent release of a "free" version of the game.</p>
<p class="docText">As we have established, most modern online games use a client-server architecture (see <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>). Originally, the server was meant only to connect players of a mostly client-based game such as a first-person shooter <a name="iddle1068" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1079" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1084" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1317" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1435" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1463" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1475" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1640" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1641" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1644" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1649" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2054" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>(FPS) game or maybe as an online license checker. Only recently has a majority of game state and game processing been relegated to the server (as is the case in MMORPG games like WoW).</p>
<p class="docText">Players of FPS games have for many years gathered at LAN parties where they would hook up their machines and play against one another. Once FPS manufacturers started protecting their client-side games with server-side technology, hooking the client games together on a LAN became more challenging. To avoid the hassle of server-side license checking, some programmers took it upon themselves to produce workarounds. Eventually, similar workarounds were applied to MMORPGs as well.</p>
<p class="docText">When three programmers wrote an open source version of Blizzard Entertainment's server software, Blizzard sued—and won. The suit is summarized on the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Web site as follows (the EFF defended the developers).</p>
<blockquote class="calibre24">
<p class="docText">At issue in this case was whether three software programmers who created the BnetD game server—which interoperates with Blizzard video games online—were in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Blizzard Games' end user license agreement (EULA).</p>
<p class="docText">BnetD was an open source program that let gamers play popular Blizzard titles like Warcraft with other gamers on servers that don't belong to Blizzard's Battle.net service. Blizzard argued that the programmers who wrote BnetD violated the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions and that the programmers also violated several parts of Blizzard's EULA, including a section on reverse engineering.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch04fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch04fn1" class="pcalibre calibre1">[1]</a></sup> The EFF Web site devoted to this case can be found at &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Emulation/Blizzard_v_bnetd/">http://www.eff.org/IP/Emulation/Blizzard_v_bnetd/</a>&gt;.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The open source server software BnetD worked fine and was easy to understand. Blizzard's problem was that buyers of the game who didn't want to pay the secondary online subscription fee to connect to commercial servers didn't have to. Blizzard thought that was unfair and a misuse of its intellectual property.</p>
<p class="docText">On the other hand, the programmers felt that they wanted to play the game just like they had played similar other games in the past—with their friends at a LAN party—or over the Internet on a shared server. They felt that Blizzard was double-dipping by charging for the game client as if it were a stand-alone game and also requiring online subscription service fees.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1321" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1322" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1323" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1500" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>Blizzard didn't see it this way. To Blizzard the open source server opened the door for people to make illegal copies of the game client and play without having a key check or an online account. Blizzard contended, and the court ultimately found that the open source server was created for pirates, not for legitimate players.</p>
<p class="docText">So just what do these EULAs and the DMCA say, anyway? With this chapter, we'll begin our foray into the legal jungle with a look at copyright law in the United States.</p>

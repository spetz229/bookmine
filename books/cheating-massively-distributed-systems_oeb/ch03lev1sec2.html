<h3 id="title-IDAWM25R" class="docSection1Title">Virtual Worlds: Game Economics and Economies</h3>
<p class="docText">Academics have studied MMOs for years. Several projects are under way to document and understand MMO player sociology (for two examples, see the PlayOn project at PARC &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/">http://blogs.parc.com/playon/</a>&gt; and the Daedalus Project &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/">http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/</a>&gt;). Sociology is fine, but in our opinion, the most interesting work involves understanding the economics of MMOs.</p>
<p class="docText">In one early study, academic Edward Castranova (now a professor at Indiana University) determined that the gross domestic product of the <a name="iddle1490" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1493" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1519" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1561" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1652" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1875" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2235" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2236" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2244" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2278" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>MMO EverQuest exceeded that of many real countries.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch03fn03">[3]</a></sup> As reported in <span class="docEmphasis">The Walrus</span> magazine:</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch03fn03" class="pcalibre calibre1">[3]</a></sup> Castranova's popular sociology paper "Virtual Worlds: A First-Hand Account of Market and Society on the Cyberian Frontier" (December 2001) can be found at &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=294828">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=294828</a>&gt;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24">
<p class="docText">The Gross National Product of EverQuest, measured by how much wealth all the players together created in a single year inside the game . . . turned out to be $2,266 U.S. per capita. By World Bank rankings, that made EverQuest richer than India, Bulgaria, or China, and nearly as wealthy as Russia.</p>

<p class="docText">It was the seventy-seventh richest country in the world.

<p class="docText">Though Castranova's estimation of EverQuest's GDP is probably too high, it is clear that the virtual worlds of online games do, in fact, create wealth out of nothing. Well, not really out of nothing—out of the time that players invest in them.</p>
<p class="docText">Professor Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago (and the author of <span class="docEmphasis">Freakonomics</span>) uses online poker to teach economics &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.pokernomics.com/">http://www.pokernomics.com/</a>&gt;. He is using the reams of data collected by online poker tracking companies (and players who track their own hands) in a large-scale analysis. One of his goals is to understand what kinds of strategies work and what kinds fail. Of course, his work might lead to better ways to play poker . . . and make money.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAGR25R" class="docSection2Title">Connections to the Real Economy</h4>
<p class="docText">Virtual world economies have not remained walled off from the real economy. Connections exist at many levels. The most obvious connection is the time gamers invest (which has obvious real-world economic value). Following closely on the heels of time is the revenue game companies generate in the real economy. But there's more. Virtual items such as pretend gold pieces or swords made exclusively of bits also have real value.</p>
<p class="docText">Most sizeable MMOs have exchange rates between virtual gold and hard currency. The Web site GameUSD.com &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://gameusd.com">http://gameusd.com</a>&gt; tracks exchange rates over time. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch03fig02">Figure 3-2</a> shows exchange rates in the first half of 2005 for WoW gold to U.S. dollars.</p>

Some game companies even employ economists to help them understand and manage their emergent economies. One of the earliest successful MMOs, Ultima Online, experienced massive inflation that led to a currency crisis in 1997. Interestingly, it turns out that the inflationary pressure came from a software exploit that allowed players to "dupe" gold (i.e., create copies of gold pieces from scratch with no work). Duping is akin to counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="docText">In any case, groups of academics are using MMOs for research purposes, focusing on which kind of economic model makes the most sense: centralized economy, free market, welfare state, and more. It turns out that game designers and game minders make critical decisions regarding the economics of their games all the time, much like central bankers do in the real world.</p>
<p class="docText">Just as there is crime in real economies, there is crime in virtual economies. Some activities are only marginally criminal (or at least against the rules of the game; see <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>). For example, gamers are often expressly forbidden from selling their characters or other objects that they acquire in the game world, but this hasn't stopped a rich middle market from developing.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAKV25R" class="docSection2Title">Middlemen</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1100" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1242" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1382" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1398" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1618" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1637" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1702" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1703" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1766" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1767" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1823" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1833" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1901" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1920" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1951" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2029" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2036" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2052" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2170" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2171" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2175" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2176" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2177" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2189" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2197" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2239" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2245" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2277" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>Game economies are certainly rich enough that they have spawned an entrepreneurial class of professionals. One early entrepreneur, Robert Kiblinger, was an Ultima Online player who went on to found UO Treasures &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.uotreasures.com/">http://www.uotreasures.com/</a>&gt;. UO Treasures is a classic middleman, buying virtual characters and items and later reselling them at a profit. This kind of activity is known in the industry as real money trading (RMT).</p>
<p class="docText">According to the book <span class="docEmphasis">Play Money</span>, the record sum for a single virtual item in a game was $100,000 paid in October 2005 for an "Asteroid Space Resort" in the Project Entropia game.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch03fn05">[5]</a></sup> Julian Dibbell, the gamer author of <span class="docEmphasis">Play Money</span>, estimates that the worldwide annual sales of virtual goods approaches $880 million and continues to grow. However, the popular virtual reality game Second Life may soon change these numbers for all time. Second Life is pushing the limits of virtual economics by explicitly allowing and supporting active trade in virtual items in its world. In fact, unlike most virtual creations in game worlds, Second Life creations belong to the creator instead of to Linden Lab (the game company). This is a novel approach to intellectual property among games. As you might imagine, this has led to some interesting legal situations. Several lawsuits are currently pending over Second Life transactions and the value of virtual property.</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch03fn05" class="pcalibre calibre1">[5]</a></sup> <span class="docEmphasis">Play Money</span> by Julian Dibbell (Basic Books, 2006).</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">The largest RMT middleman outfit is Internet Gaming Entertainment, known to gamers as IGE &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.ige.com/">http://www.ige.com/</a>&gt;. IGE was founded by child actor Brock Pierce and Alan Debonneville and in August 2005 had about 420 employees. Interestingly, IGE runs its currency trading operations in Hong Kong.

<p class="docText">Like all economies, MMOs harbor a dark side. First, companies like IGE provide easy access to real money for would-be game hackers. The problem is that middleman companies are not often very diligent about the origin of the various game items they trade in. They're just as happy to buy and sell gold that has been created through duping as they are to buy and sell <a name="iddle1064" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1214" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1432" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1542" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1859" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2098" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2116" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2173" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2242" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>legitimate level 60 characters created over months of constant gaming. (Rumor has it that the Star Wars Galaxies hacker we mentioned in Chapter 1 used IGE to launder his duped money.) <span class="docEmphasis">Wired</span> magazine reports that entrepreneurs in Russia pay workers a small base salary ($100 per week) to create in-game money that is then sold to IGE. Very productive workers can make even more real money. The disparity between developing countries' economies and first-world economies is what makes a scheme like this work.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch03fn08">[8]</a></sup></p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch03fn08" class="pcalibre calibre1">[8]</a></sup> "Boring Game?

<p class="docText">The line between creating virtual money by paying hourly workers versus using automated bots is very thin, but it seems to be important. <span class="docEmphasis">Wired</span> reports:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre24">
<p class="docText">Automation . . . is generally considered cheating, and is frowned upon. IGE CEO Brock Pierce said the company cracks down on suppliers whose volumes imply they're using bots. That leaves the other method: cheap labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Other gamers are less tolerant of this kind of play, however, and have been known to gang up and kill the hourly farmers.</p>
<p class="docText">Less legitimate game services companies come and go with some regularity. Some, like the now defunct BlackSnow Interactive (BSI), open sweatshops where low-wage hourly workers constantly "play" characters in order for them to gain experience and level up. BlackSnow was created to level up Dark Age of Camelot characters. Mythic, the company that created the game, eventually forced them to close down.</p>
<p class="docText">In early 2007, eBay announced a ban on trading in online game items. This is very likely to have a huge positive impact on the middleman market. According to news reports, eBay's share of the market was multiple millions. CNET reports, "While there is no universally agreed-upon value for the RMT market, it is assumed to be worth somewhere between $250m and $880m a year."<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch03fn09">[9]</a></sup></p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch03fn09" class="pcalibre calibre1">[9]</a></sup> "eBay Bans Auctions of Game Goods," by Daniel Terdiman (January 30, 2007; see &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029694,49287317,00.htm">http://news.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029694,49287317,00.htm</a>&gt;).</p></blockquote>

<p class="docText">The market for middlemen also includes a mercenary class of people willing to play characters or simply play games for a fee.

<h4 id="title-IDAAH35R" class="docSection2Title">Thottbot</h4>
<p class="docText">Thottbot is both an application and a Web site &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.thottbot.com/">http://www.thottbot.com/</a>&gt;, now owned, like many other game consolidation Web sites, by IGE. Thottbot amasses and collects vast amounts of information about the WoW world. Gamers install the Thottbot plug-in (called Cosmos), which communicates raw information to the Thottbot application. This information is then organized into an extensive database that players can use to improve their play.</p>
<p class="docText">The Thottbot database includes an extensive inventory that itemizes a large percentage of the virtual property that exists in the WoW universe. This database includes information on mobs (i.e., nonplayer characters, monsters, objects that can own or transport merchandise). Thottbot collects information by mining a large number of WoW clients for the data.</p>
<p class="docText">The Thottbot application tracks which character or mob has what and makes this information available to players who have installed the helper application on their PCs. The plug-in reads information from the database and displays helpful statistics about what's going on around your character. In some sense, it works like a very well informed assistant. Of course, while it's helping, it's also busy collecting information to send back to the Thottbot server.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1020" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1266" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1365" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1461" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1764" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1789" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2117" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2240" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>The Thottbot assistant provides services, such as delivering a map showing players how to get items they may want and marking that map with probability percentages so they can decide their course of action.</p>
<p class="docText">This is clearly useful information for a gamer willing to know more about the game than other players not using the service. And it's also useful for sweatshop players, who can make the best use of their labor when directed by a system like Thottbot.</p>
<p class="docText">This has led some people to question the links between Thottbot and IGE. We know that IGE owns Thottbot. And we know that Thottbot reads your inventory and other data to know what gamers who use the system have. This information could be used in many ways, from price fixing to arbitrage to market maximization.</p>
<p class="docText">IGE also purchased Allalhazam and OGaming, which are similar in nature to Thottbot. This kind of consolidation is met with mixed reviews by hard-core gamers who wonder whether the IGE philosophy will pervade the gaming world (many gamers disagree vehemently with the very idea of selling characters or items).</p>

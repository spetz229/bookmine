<h3 id="title-IDAQWUMP" class="docSection1Title">Hacking Games</h3>
<p class="docText">By now we've established a clear motive for exploiting online games. Much money can be made, gaming software was not really designed with security in mind, and games are in widespread use. The good news is that at least some game developers are aware of the problem and have begun to think about security while they design their games. The White Hat Corner presents nine rules about game development and security identified by guru game developer Matt Pritchard.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec8" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDA1WUMP" class="docSection2Title">Who Hacks Games?</h4>
<p class="docText">Game hacking is almost as old as games themselves. As online games emerged with the popularization of the Internet in the 1990s, a number of game hackers gained prominence. Many of the first game programmers were classic hackers in the MIT sense of the word—technologists interested in learning as much as they could about how the games really worked. Eventually, these hackers created systems that could be used to cheat.</p>
<p class="docText">An excellent history of cheating in the online game Counter-Strike can be found in Wikipedia &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_Counter-Strike">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_Counter-Strike</a>&gt;. This article discusses a Russian hacker calling himself Vasily (the author of the hook.dll program) and a Swedish high school student who went by the handle XQZ (and created an aimbot collection called XQZ2). These two were among the first game exploiters.</p>

<p class="docText">Game developer and guru Matt Pritchard wrote an article available on Gamasutra &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000724/pritchard_pfv.htm">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000724/pritchard_pfv.htm</a>&gt; entitled "How to Hurt the Hackers: The Scoop on Internet Cheating and How You Can Combat It."

<p class="docText">Today, groups of hackers calling themselves clans work together to compromise games. One such group is the TKC (short for Teamkill and Cheat) Community &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.tkc-community.net">http://www.tkc-community.net</a>&gt;). These loose affiliations of players develop and trade exploits among themselves, mostly for reasons of prestige. Clans keep cheats secret so that they will continue to work. A cheat in the open (including the ones covered in this book) is often a cheat with a countermeasure.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec9" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAPDVMP" class="docSection1Title">Why Hack Games?</h4>
<p class="docText">Hackers create cheats for simple reasons: money, fame, and glory.</p>
<p class="docText">In the Black Hat Corner, the cheat author Vasily discusses his motives and justifications for cheating. Interviews and manifestos can be found all over the Internet. As an example, members of the TKC Community mention a number of reasons for hacking games in their FAQ at &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://tkc-community.net/Main/modules.php?name=TKFAQ">http://tkc-community.net/Main/modules.php?name=TKFAQ</a>&gt;. They start with this little gem:</p>

<h5 id="title-IDABEVMP" class="docSection3Title">Cheating Philosophy</h5>
<blockquote class="calibre24">
<p class="docText">As with real life, there are many different types of people present in online gaming, with many different tastes. Some are content with a game as it was intended for play by the developers, while others are not. We do not agree with the notion that if one is not satisfied with a game the way it was developed, that a player should look for another game to play. When a game does not meet one's expectations, or has lost its former appeal, the use of game modification techniques is encouraged to create a better gameplay experience for the player. This same belief applies to unintended coding vulnerabilities as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Then they go on to present a list of reasons why someone might want to hack online games (and join their group):</p>
<ul class="calibre18"><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">To Prolong the Gaming Experience</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Companionship</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">To Challenge Ourselves</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Amusement</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Offline Hecklers</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">For Attention</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Non-Conformity</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Kiss Ass</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Revenge</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Advertisement</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">Get an Edge</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">By Accident</p></li><li class="calibre19"><p class="docText">To Spy</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Over time, as the economies of online games have developed and become tied in with the real economy, the original motive for cheating—gaining status—has shifted to making money. Early cheaters were basically showing off their hacking skills and building up a technical reputation. Some even tried to help the game builders (but were reportedly turned down). Most early cheats were eventually eradicated once discovered by game companies. As a result, more recent cheats are kept under close wraps and sold and traded carefully between clans.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDADGVMP" class="docSection1Title">How to Hack Games</h4>
<p class="docText">One of our goals with this book is to show you in as detailed a manner as possible how game hacks work. That means there will be plenty of code in this book. In fact, some of the things we intend to show you get downright hairy. We're forced to show you lots of code because simply describing a technique in philosophical terms is often unsatisfying and vague. To understand game hacking properly, there is no alternative to getting your hands dirty.</p>
<p class="docText">There is a catch. Getting your hands dirty by working your way through real game hacks requires an actual target. We choose to use WoW for many of our explicit examples for two reasons. The first is that WoW is the most popular MMORPG on the planet, and a majority of players have no clue what some of their gaming compatriots are doing to cheat. The second is that many of the classic techniques of game hacking have already been leveled against WoW, and we can easily show you the results. For example, when there are open source game hacking tools available (and they are abundant for WoW), we show them to you.</p>

[. . .] Yes, my position in this is well-known, I'm not against the cheating in computer games. I do not care about it—in my opinion it is not a problem at all and if it is a problem for someone, he has to sit and reconsider his life carefully. There is a lot of things you should be proud of fighting for rather than cheating. Terrorism, racism, discrimination, misery, unemployment, crime. According to UN reports, every day thousands of children are starved. Every day people in Israel, Palestine and other hot spots are dying of the war. Cities and states are attacked by terrorists. You still tell me that cheating in computer games is a most serious problem which should be solved immediately coute que coute? You must be kidding!</p>

<p class="docText">Here's a quick overview of what we intend to cover in this book on the technical front. We start off fairly light with coverage of what we call game hacking 101 techniques in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>. We begin with a farming bot that uses rudimentary techniques. The idea behind <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> is to provide some vocabulary and a list of game hacking approaches. We cover bots, GUI hacks, proxies, memory hacking, debuggers, randomness, and rootkits. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a> also covers countermeasures and shows the lengths that some game companies will go to in order to prevent cheating. We'll dive into some code that watches the watcher, so that you get a real feel for what is happening on your PC when you install a game client.</p>
<p class="docText">The next chunk of technical material comes in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, which is about bugs and flaws in games and why these make excellent game hacking targets. One of the most interesting things about our work on MMORPG security is that the kinds of security vulnerabilities we discuss are becoming more and more common in domains outside of gaming. In fact, MMORPG defects are a harbinger of things to come. Massively distributed software programs that actively manipulate state for thousands of interacting processes using central servers always have very complex time and state issues.

<p class="docText">Things start to get deeper from a technical perspective in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, which explains game client hacking in some detail. We use the metaphor of "getting around the game" to build categories of techniques, explaining what it means to go over, in, under, and way outside the game. There is lots of code in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, making the techniques we describe abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="docText">The only problem with <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a> is its smorgasbord approach to game hacking techniques. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> addresses that problem head on by combining a number of the techniques introduced in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a> into a sophisticated bot program. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a> steps through bot fundamentals and ends by describing some working debugger-based bot code.</p>
<p class="docText">The deepest, darkest techniques in the book are introduced in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> is all about reverse engineering a game. Turns out that a basic handle on reversing is necessary if you want any hope of building new techniques by analogy to the ones on display in <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapters 6</a> and <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch07.html#ch07">7</a>. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> is a basic introduction to reversing, showing you some useful heuristics we have developed over the years.</p>
<p class="docText">Total conversions and other game mods are in some sense the apex of game hacking. <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> shows you how these kinds of things are done. Once again, there is no shortage of code demonstrating exactly what we mean.</p>
<p class="docText">So enjoy your romp through this book, but don't be surprised when you need to get out your keyboard and your compiler to get things straight.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec11" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAAOVMP" class="docSection1Title">How Much Game Hacking Happens?</h4>
<p class="docText">Nobody is sure exactly how rampant cheating is in online games. If the game companies know, they aren't telling. They do, however, selectively ban suspected cheaters from their servers. In 2005, Blizzard Entertainment banned over 1,000 players from WoW for that reason.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="#ch01fn10">[10]</a></sup> The game company Valve has also banned players. But getting back into the game is often as simple as buying another copy with a different serial key and in some sense starting over.</p><blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="docFootnote1"><sup class="calibre31"><a name="ch01fn10" class="pcalibre calibre1">[10]</a></sup> See the article "World of Warcraft Players Banned for Selling Gold" at &lt;<a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7392">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7392</a>&gt;.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Game companies are ambivalent about cheating until it affects play for noncheaters in an obvious manner. In <a class="pcalibre6 pcalibre5 calibre1" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, we describe an inflation problem in Ultima Online as one example of how an inherent tolerance threshold can be crossed. In some cases, game companies use anticheating <a name="iddle1110" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle1541" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2047" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2070" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a><a name="iddle2073" class="pcalibre calibre1"></a>mechanisms as differentiators to attract gamers. Many gamers abhor cheaters and will switch games to avoid them. In other cases, small-scale cheating (such as farming) is tolerated and maybe even encouraged. (Don't forget that sweatshop farmers must purchase legitimate licenses for their workers to create value, and that means the game company is realizing revenue.) Ultimately, the cheating acceptance tradeoff is one that must be carefully negotiated by game companies.</p>

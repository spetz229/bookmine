<div class="book" title="Distributed Testing"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect19_d1e8853" class="calibre1"></a>Distributed Testing</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e8857" class="calibre1"></a><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e8862" class="calibre1"></a>One solution to cross-browser testing is outsourcing the
    problem to a dedicated cluster of browsers. This is exactly the approach
    of <a class="ulink" href="http://swarm.jquery.org">TestSwarm</a><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e8868" class="calibre1"></a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre17">The primary goal of TestSwarm is to take the complicated, and
      time-consuming, process of running JavaScript test suites in multiple
      browsers and to grossly simplify it. It achieves this goal by providing
      all the tools necessary for creating a continuous integration workflow
      for your JavaScript project.</p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre3">Rather than using plug-ins and extensions to integrate with browsers
    at a low level, TestSwarm takes the reverse approach. Browsers open up the
    TestSwarm endpoint, and automatically process tests pushed toward them.
    They can be located on any <span class="calibre1">machine</span>
    or operating system—all it takes to add a new browser is to navigate to
    the TestSwarm endpoint inside it.</p><p class="calibre3">This simple approach takes a lot of the pain and hassle out of
    running a continuous integration server. All that’s involved is ensuring a
    decent number of browsers are connected to the swarm. Indeed, this is
    something you could outsource if you have an active community, achieving
    probably the most realistic testbed you could hope for, as shown in <a class="ulink" href="ch09s04.html#fig_9_6" title="Figure 9-6. TestSwarm returns results to browsers as a grid of test suites">Figure 9-6</a>.</p><div class="book"><div class="figure"><a id="fig_9_6" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="I_mediaobject9_d1e8887" class="calibre1"></a><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages885492.png.jpg" alt="TestSwarm returns results to browsers as a grid of test suites" class="calibre5"/></div></div><p class="title4">Figure 9-6. TestSwarm returns results to browsers as a grid of test
      suites</p></div></div><p class="calibre3">The alternative is to use a company like <a class="ulink" href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e8896" class="calibre1"></a> to manage and run all those browsers in the cloud. Simply
    upload any Selenium tests and their service will do the rest, running the
    tests on different browsers and platforms, making sure they all
    pass.</p></div></div>

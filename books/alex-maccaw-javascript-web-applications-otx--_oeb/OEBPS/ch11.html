<div class="calibre7"></div><div class="book" title="Chapter 11. The Spine Library"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre7"></div><h1 class="title1"><a id="libraries---spine" class="calibre1"></a>Chapter 11. The Spine Library</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a class="ulink" href="http://maccman.github.com/spine">Spine</a> <a id="index-543U812UO2A" class="calibre1"></a><a id="index-447S833MP6G" class="calibre1"></a>is a lightweight library for JavaScript application
  development that uses many of the concepts we’ve covered in this book, such
  as MVC, events, and classes. When I say lightweight, I mean lightweight—the
  library comes in at around 500 lines of JavaScript, which is about 2K
  minified and compressed. Don’t get the wrong impression, though; Spine will
  let you build fully featured JavaScript applications while ensuring your
  code remains clean and decoupled.</p><p class="calibre3">I created Spine while writing this book because I couldn’t find a
  client-side MVC framework that quite suited my needs. The library attempts
  to enshrine many of the best practices proposed in this book, and indeed the
  book’s example application, Holla, is built using Spine.</p><p class="calibre3">Unlike widget-based libraries such as <a class="ulink" href="http://cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a>, Spine doesn’t make any
  decisions about how you display data to users. The emphasis is on
  flexibility and simplicity. Spine gives you the bare bones and gets out of
  your way so you get on with the fun stuff—developing awesome
  applications.</p><p class="calibre3">Spine includes a class library with inheritance support; <code class="literal">Spine.Class</code>; an events module, <code class="literal">Spine.Events</code>; an ORM, <code class="literal">Spine.Model</code>; and a controller class, <code class="literal">Spine.Controller</code>. Anything else you’ll need, like
  templating support or a DOM library, is up to you, so use what you’re most
  familiar with. Having said that, Spine includes specific support for jQuery
  and Zepto.js libraries, which complement it excellently.</p><p class="calibre3">Spine’s weakness at the moment is its lack of documentation. But since
  it’s still the early days of this library, the documentation situation is
  sure to improve. For now, this chapter should give you a pretty good
  introduction, and the sample applications will provide further
  explanation.</p><div class="book" title="Setup"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect111_d1e10156" class="calibre1"></a>Setup</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="I_indexterm11_d1e10160" class="calibre1"></a>Simply download Spine from the <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/maccman/spine">project’s repository</a> and
    include it in your page; Spine has no dependencies:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;script src="spine.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p class="calibre3">Spine is completely namespaced behind the <code class="literal">Spine</code> variable, so it shouldn’t conflict with
    any other variables. You can safely include libraries like jQuery, Zepto,
    or Prototype without any complications.</p></div></div></div>

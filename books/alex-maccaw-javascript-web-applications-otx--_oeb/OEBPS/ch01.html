    looked when it was first conceived. It’s easy to forget how far the
    language has come from its initial implementation in Netscape’s browser,
    to the powerful engines of today, such as Google’s V8. It’s been a rocky
    path involving renaming, merging, and the eventual standardization as
    ECMAScript. The capabilities we have today are beyond the wildest dreams
    of those early innovators.</p><p class="calibre3">Despite its success and popularity, JavaScript is still widely
    misunderstood. Few people know that it’s a powerful and dynamic
    object-oriented language. They’re surprised to learn about some of its
    more advanced features, such as prototypal inheritance, modules, and
    namespaces. So, why is JavaScript so misunderstood?</p><p class="calibre3">Part of the reason is due to previous buggy JavaScript
    implementations, and part of it is due to the name—the
    <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">Java</em></span> prefix suggests it’s somehow related to Java; in
    reality, it’s a totally different language. However, I think the real
    reason is the way most developers are introduced to the language. With
    other languages, such as Python and Ruby, developers usually make a
    concerted effort to learn the language with the help of books,
    screencasts, and tutorials. Until recently, though, JavaScript wasn’t
    given that endorsement. Developers would get requests to add a bit of form
    validation—maybe a lightbox or a photo gallery—to existing code, often on
    a tight schedule. They’d use scripts they’d find on the Internet, calling
    it a day with little understanding of the language behind it. After that
    basic exposure, some of them might even add JavaScript to their
    resumes.</p><p class="calibre3">Recently, JavaScript engines and browsers have become so powerful
    that building full-blown applications in JavaScript is not only feasible,
    but increasingly popular. Applications like Gmail and Google Maps have
    paved the way to a completely different way of thinking about web
    applications, and users are clamoring for more. Companies are hiring
    full-time JavaScript developers. No longer is JavaScript a sublanguage
    relegated to simple scripts and a bit of form validation—it is now a
    standalone language in its own right, realizing its full potential.</p><p class="calibre3">This influx of popularity means that a lot of new JavaScript
    applications are being built. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the
    language’s history, many of them are constructed very poorly. For some
    reason, when it comes to JavaScript, acknowledged patterns and best
    practices fly out the window. Developers ignore architectural models like
    the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, instead blending their
    applications into a messy soup of HTML and JavaScript.</p><p class="calibre3">This book won’t teach you much about JavaScript as a language—other
    books are better suited for that, such as Douglas Crockford’s
    <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4"><a class="ulink" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748">JavaScript: The Good
    Parts</a></em></span> (O’Reilly). However, this book will show you how
    to structure and build complex JavaScript applications, allowing you to
    create incredible web experiences.</p></div></div></div>

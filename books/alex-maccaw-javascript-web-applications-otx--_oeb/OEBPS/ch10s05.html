<div class="book" title="Using a CDN"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect110_d1e9976" class="calibre1"></a>Using a CDN</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="I_indexterm10_d1e9980" class="calibre1"></a><a id="I_indexterm10_d1e9985" class="calibre1"></a><a id="I_indexterm10_d1e9988" class="calibre1"></a>A content delivery network, or CDN, can serve static content
    on your behalf, reducing its load time. The user’s proximity to the web
    server can have an impact on load times. CDNs can deploy your content
    across multiple geographically dispersed servers, so when a user requests
    a resource, it can be served up from a server near them (ideally in the
    same country). Yahoo! has found that CDNs can improve enduser response
    times by 20% <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#cdn">or
    more</a>.</p><p class="calibre3">Depending on how much you can afford to spend, there are lot of
    companies out there offering CDNs, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.akamai.com">Akamai Technologies</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.limelightnetworks.com">Limelight Networks</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.edgecast.com">EdgeCast</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.level3.com">Level 3 Communications</a>. <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> has recently
    released an affordable option called <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">Cloud Front</a> that ties into
    its <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3 service</a> closely and
    may be a good option for startups.</p><p class="calibre3">Google offers a free CDN and loading architecture for many popular
    open source JavaScript libraries, including jQuery and jQueryUI. One of
    the advantages of using Google’s CDN is that many other sites use it too,
    increasing the likelihood that any JavaScript files you reference are
    already cached in a user’s browser.</p><p class="calibre3">Check out the list of <a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html">available
    libraries</a>. If, <a id="I_indexterm10_d1e10026" class="calibre1"></a>say, you want to include the <a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery">jQuery
    library</a>, you can either use Google’s JavaScript loader library or,
    more simply, a plain old script tag:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;!-- minimized version of the jQuery library --&gt;
&lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- minimized version of the jQuery UI library --&gt;
&lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/jquery-ui.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p class="calibre3">You’ll notice that in the example above we haven’t specified a
    protocol; instead, <code class="literal">//</code> is used. This is
    a little-known trick that ensures the script file is fetched using the
    same protocol as the host page. In other words, if your page was loaded
    securely over HTTPS, the script file will be as well, eliminating any
    security warnings. A relative URL without a scheme is valid and compliant
    to the RTF spec. More importantly, it’s got support across the board;
    heck, protocol-relative URLs even work in Internet Explorer 3.0.</p></div></div>

    <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">not</em></span> make large JavaScript applications. Instead, you
    should decouple your application into a series of fairly independent
    components. The mistake developers often make is creating applications
    with a lot of interdependency, with huge linear JavaScript files
    generating a slew of HTML tags. These sorts of applications are difficult
    to maintain and extend, so they should be avoided at all costs.</p><p class="calibre3">Paying a bit of attention to an application’s structure when you
    start building it can make a big difference to the end result. Ignore any
    preconceived notions you have about JavaScript and treat it like the
    object-oriented language <a id="I_indexterm1_d1e561" class="calibre1"></a>that it is. Use classes, inheritance, objects, and patterns
    the same way you would if you were building an application in another
    language, such as Python or Ruby. Architecture is critical to server-side
    applications, so why shouldn’t the same apply to client-side apps?</p><p class="calibre3">The approach this book advocates is the MVC pattern, a tried and
    tested way of architecting applications that ensures they can be
    effectively maintained and extended. It’s also a pattern that applies
    particularly well to JavaScript applications.</p></div></div>

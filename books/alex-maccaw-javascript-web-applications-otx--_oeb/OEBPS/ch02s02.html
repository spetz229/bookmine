    ordering. If an element and one of its ancestors have an event handler for
    the same event type, which one should fire first when the event is
    triggered? Well, you won’t be surprised to hear that Netscape and
    Microsoft had different ideas.</p><p class="calibre3">Netscape 4 supported event <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">capturing</em></span><a id="I_indexterm2_d1e1772" class="calibre1"></a>, which triggers event listeners from the top-most ancestor
    to the element in question—i.e., from the outside in.</p><p class="calibre3">Microsoft endorsed event <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">bubbling</em></span><a id="I_indexterm2_d1e1780" class="calibre1"></a>, which triggers event listeners from the element,
    propagating up through its ancestors—i.e., from the inside out.</p><p class="calibre3">Event bubbling makes more sense to me, and it is likely to be the
    model used in day-to-day development. The W3C compromised and stipulated
    support for both event models in their specification. Events conforming to
    the W3C model are first captured until they reach the target element;
    then, they bubble up again.</p><p class="calibre3">You can choose the type of event handler you want to register,
    capturing or bubbling, which is where the <code class="literal">useCapture</code> argument to <code class="literal">addEventListener()</code> comes into the picture. If
    the last argument to <code class="literal">addEventListener()</code>
    is <code class="literal">true</code>, the event handler is set for
    the capturing phase; if it is <code class="literal">false</code>,
    the event handler is set for the bubbling phase:</p><pre class="screen">// Use bubbling by passing false as the last argument
button.addEventListener("click", function(){ /* ... */ }, false);</pre><p class="calibre3">The vast majority of the time, you’ll probably be using event
    bubbling. If in doubt, pass <code class="literal">false</code> as
    the last argument to <code class="literal">addEventListener()</code>.</p></div></div>

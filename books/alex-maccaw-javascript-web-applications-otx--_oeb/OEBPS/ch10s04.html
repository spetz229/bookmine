    the Web. It was developed by the GNU project, and support for it was added
    in HTTP/1.1. Web clients indicate their support for compression by sending
    an <code class="literal">Accept-Encoding</code> header along with
    the request:</p><pre class="screen">Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate</pre><p class="calibre3">If the web server sees this header and supports any of the
    compression types listed, it may compress its response and indicate this
    via the <code class="literal">Content-Encoding</code> header:</p><pre class="screen">Content-Encoding: gzip</pre><p class="calibre3">Browsers can then decode the response properly. Obviously,
    compressing the data can reduce network time, but the true extent of this
    is often not realized. Gzip generally reduces the response size by 70%, a
    massive reduction that greatly speeds up the time it takes for your site
    to load.</p><p class="calibre3">Servers generally have to be configured over which file types should
    be gzipped. A good rule of thumb is to gzip any text response, such as
    HTML, JSON, JavaScript, and stylesheets. If the files are already
    compressed, such as images and PDFs, they shouldn’t be served with gzip
    because the recompression doesn’t reduce their size.</p><p class="calibre3">Configuring gzip depends on your web server, but if you use Apache
    2.x or later, the module you need is <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html">mod_deflate</a><a id="I_indexterm10_d1e9972" class="calibre1"></a>. For other web servers, see their documentation.</p></div></div>

    because it makes a huge difference to the user experience (UX)<a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7925" class="calibre1"></a> and can have a direct impact on revenue. Companies, such as
    the following, are studying its implications all the time:</p><div class="book"><dl class="book"><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1">Amazon</span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">100 ms of extra load time caused a 1% drop in sales (source:

          of people who clicked “back” before the page even loaded (source:
          Nicole Sullivan, Yahoo!).</p></dd></dl></div><p class="calibre3">Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed because this is
    what users are going to notice. So, the key is to make users think an
    application is fast, even if in reality it isn’t. The ability to do this
    is one of the benefits of JavaScript applications—UI doesn’t block, even
    if a background request is taking a while.</p><p class="calibre3">Let’s take the chat room scenario again. A user sends a new message,
    firing off an Ajax request to the server. We could wait until the message
    performs a roundtrip through the server and clients before appending it to
    the chat log. However, that would introduce a couple of seconds’ latency
    between the time a user submitted a new message and when it appeared in
    her chat log. The application would seem slow, which would definitely hurt
    the user experience.</p><p class="calibre3">Instead, why not create the new message locally, thereby immediately
    adding it to the chat log? From a user’s perspective, it seems like the
    message has been sent instantly. Users won’t know (or care) that the
    message hasn’t yet been delivered to other clients in the chat room.
    They’ll just be happy with a fast and snappy user experience.</p><p class="calibre3">Aside from interactions, one of the slowest parts of Web
    applications is loading in new data. It’s important to do intelligent
    preloading<a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7956" class="calibre1"></a> to try to[ predict what a user will need before he actually
    asks for it. Then, cache the data in memory; if the user needs it
    subsequently, you shouldn’t have to request it again from the server. Upon
    startup, the application should preload commonly used data. Users are more
    likely to be forgiving of slower initial load times than once the
    application’s loaded.</p><p class="calibre3">You should always give users feedback when they interact with your
    application, usually with some sort of visual indicator. In business
    jargon this is called <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">expectation managment</em></span><a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7966" class="calibre1"></a>, making sure clients are aware of a project’s status and
    ETA. The same applies to UX—users will be more patient if they’re given an
    indication that something’s happening. While users are waiting for new
    data, show them a message or a spinner. If a file’s being uploaded, show a
    progress bar and an estimated duration. All this gives a perception of
    speed, improving the user experience.<a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7970" class="calibre1"></a></p></div></div>

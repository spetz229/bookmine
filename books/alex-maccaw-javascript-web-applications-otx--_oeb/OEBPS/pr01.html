  of the Netscape browser, to the high-performance JIT interpreters of today.
  Even just five years ago developers were blown away by Ajax and the yellow
  fade technique; now, complex JavaScript apps run into the hundreds of
  thousands of lines.</p><p class="calibre3">In the last year, a new breed of JavaScript applications has appeared,
  giving an experience people were used to on the desktop, but that was
  unheard of on the Web. Gone are the slow page requests every time a user
  interacts with an application; instead, JavaScript engines are now so
  powerful we can keep state client side, giving a much more responsive and
  improved experience.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s not just JavaScript engines that have improved; CSS3 and HTML5
  specs haven’t finished the drafting stage, but they are already widely
  supported by modern browsers such as Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and—to some
  extent—IE9. Beautiful interfaces can be coded in a fraction of the time
  previously required, and without all that notorious image cutting and
  splicing. Support for HTML5 and CSS3 is getting better every day, but you’ll
  need to decide—based on your client base—whether to use these <span class="calibre1">technologies</span>.</p><p class="calibre3">Moving state to the client side is no simple task. It requires a
  completely different development approach to server-side applications. You
  need to think about structure, templating, communicating with the server,
  frameworks, and much more. That’s where this book comes in; I’ll take you
  through all the steps necessary to create state-of-the-art JavaScript
  applications.</p><div class="book" title="Who Is This Book For?"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre7"></div><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect1_d1e153" class="calibre1"></a>Who Is This Book For?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3">This book isn’t for JavaScript newbies, so if you’re unfamiliar with
    the basics of the language, I advise you to pick up one of the many good
    books on the subject, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748"><span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">JavaScript: The
    Good Parts</em></span></a> by Douglas Crockford (O’Reilly). This book
    is aimed at developers with some JavaScript experience, perhaps using a
    library like jQuery, who want to get into building more advanced
    JavaScript applications. Additionally, many sections of the
    book—especially the appendixes—will also be a useful reference for
    experienced JavaScript developers.</p></div></div></div>

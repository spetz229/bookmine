  Applications</em></span> is a Long-eared owl.</p><p class="calibre3">The Long-eared owl (<span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">Asio otus</em></span>) is a slender,
  grayish-brown woodland owl that’s characterized by long, upright ear tufts
  positioned in the middle of its head. At one time, its distinctive ears
  earned it the nickname “cat owl.”</p><p class="calibre3">Long-eared owls can be found in the open woodlands, thickets, and
  forest edges of North America, Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Their
  diets consist almost entirely of small mammals, primarily voles and mice,
  which they’re able to locate in complete darkness due to the asymmetrical
  positioning of their ear openings. They fly back and forth over low-cover
  areas to locate their food; their flight is light and buoyant and is often
  compared to that of a large moth.</p><p class="calibre3">Long-eared owls do not build their own nests; instead, they settle in
  abandoned stick nests of magpies, crows, hawks, and squirrels. They tend to
  become dispersed and territorial during their breeding season (which
  typically occurs between mid-March and early June), whereas during the
  winter months, they roost communally to keep warm, often in clusters of 7–50
  birds.</p><p class="calibre3">The cover image is from Wood’s <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">Animate Creations</em></span>.

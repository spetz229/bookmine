          and covers some of the underlying influences of its current
          implementation and community. We then give you an introduction to
          the MVC architectural pattern, in addition to exploring JavaScript’s
          constructor functions, prototypal inheritance, and how to create
          your own class library.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Events and Observing">Chapter 2</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter gives you a brief primer on browser events,
          including their history, API, and behavior. We’ll cover how to bind
          to events with jQuery, use delegation, and create custom events.
          We’ll also explore using non-DOM events with the PubSub
          pattern.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Models and Data">Chapter 3</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter explains how to use MVC models in your
          application, as well as for loading and manipulating remote data.
          We’ll explain why MVC and namespacing are important and then build
          our own ORM library to manage model data. Next, we’ll cover how to
          load in remote data using JSONP and cross-domain Ajax. Finally,
          you’ll learn how to persist model data using HTML5 Local Storage and
          submitting it to a RESTful server.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Controllers and State">Chapter 4</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter demonstrates how to use a controller pattern to
          persist state on the client side. We’ll discuss how to use modules
          to encapsulate logic and prevent global namespace pollution, then
          we’ll cover how to cleanly interface controllers with views,
          listening to events and manipulating the DOM. Finally, we’ll discuss
          routing, first using the URL’s hash fragment, and then using the
          newer HTML5 History API, making sure to explain the pros and cons of
          both approaches.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Views and Templating">Chapter 5</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This is where we cover views and JavaScript templating. We
          cover the different ways of dynamically rendering views, as well as
          various templating libraries and where to actually store the
          templates (inline in the page, in script tags, or with remote
          loading). Then, you’ll learn about data binding—connecting your
          model controllers and views to dynamically synchronize model data
          and view data.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Dependency Management">Chapter 6</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’ll get into the details of JavaScript
          dependency management using CommonJS modules. You’ll learn the
          history and thinking behind the CommonJS movement, how to create
          CommonJS modules in the browser, and various module loader libraries
          to help you with this, such as Yabble and RequireJS. <span class="calibre1">Next, we’ll</span> discuss how to
          automatically wrap up modules server side, increasing performance
          and saving time. Finally, we’ll cover various alternatives to
          CommonJS, such as Sprockets and LABjs.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Working with Files">Chapter 7</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">Here, we’ll get into some of the benefits HTML5 gives us: the
          File API. We’ll cover browser support, multiple uploads, receiving
          files that are dragged onto the browser, and files from clipboard
          events. Next, we’ll explore reading files using blobs and slices,
          and displaying the result in the browser. We’ll cover uploading
          files in the background using the new XMLHttpRequest Level 2
          specification, and finally, we’ll show you how to give your users
          live upload progress bars and how to integrate uploads with jQuery’s
          Ajax API.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. The Real-Time Web">Chapter 8</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">We’ll take a look at some of the exciting developments with
          real-time applications and WebSockets. First, the chapter covers
          real time’s rather turbulent history and its current support in the
          browsers. Then, we’ll get into the details of WebSockets and their
          high-level implementation, browser support, and JavaScript API.
          Next, we’ll demonstrate a simple RPC server that uses WebSockets to
          connect up servers and clients. We’ll then take a look at Socket.IO
          and learn how real time fits into applications’ architecture and
          user experience.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Testing and Debugging">Chapter 9</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter covers testing and debugging, a crucial part of
          JavaScript web application development. We’ll look at the issues
          surrounding cross-browser testing, which browsers you should test
          in, and unit tests and testing libraries, such as QUnit and Jasmine.
          Next, we’ll take a look at automated testing and continuous
          integration servers, such as Selenium. We’ll then get into the
          debugging side of things, exploring Firefox and WebKit’s Web
          Inspectors, the console, and using the JavaScript debugger.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Deploying">Chapter 10</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter covers another important—but often neglected—part
          of JavaScript web applications: deployment. Chiefly, we’ll consider
          performance and how to use caching, minification, gzip compression,
          and other techniques to decrease your application’s initial load
          time. Finally, we’ll briefly cover how to use CDNs to serve static
          content on your behalf, and how to use the browser’s built-in
          auditor, which can be immensely helpful in improving your site’s
          performance.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. The Spine Library">Chapter 11</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">The next three chapters give you an introduction to some
          popular JavaScript libraries for application development. Spine is a
          lightweight MVC-compliant library that uses many of the concepts
          covered in the book. We’ll take you through the core parts of the
          library: classes, events, models, and controllers. Finally, we’ll
          build an example contacts manager application that will demonstrate
          what we’ve learned from the chapter.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. The Backbone Library">Chapter 12</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">Backbone is an extremely popular library for building
          JavaScript applications, and this chapter will give you a thorough
          introduction. We’ll take you through the core concepts and classes
          of Backbone, such as models, collections, controllers, and views.
          Next, we’ll explore syncing model data with the server using RESTful
          JSON queries and how to respond to Backbone appropriately server
          side. Finally, we’ll build an example to-do list application that
          will demonstrate much of the library.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. The JavascriptMVC Library">Chapter 13</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This chapter explores the JavaScriptMVC library, a popular
          jQuery-based <span class="calibre1">framework</span> for
          building JavaScript web applications. You’ll learn all the basics of
          JavaScriptMVC, such as classes, models, and controllers, as well as
          using client-side templates to render views. The chapter ends with a
          practical CRUD list example, demonstrating how easy it is to create
          abstract, reusable, memory-safe widgets with JavaScriptMVC.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. jQuery Primer">Appendix A</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">This appendix provides a brief introduction to jQuery, which
          is useful if you feel you need to brush up on the library. Most of
          the book’s examples use jQuery, so it’s important to be familiar
          with it. We’ll cover most of the core API, such as traversing the
          DOM, manipulating the DOM, and event binding, triggering, and
          delegating. Next, we’ll approach jQuery’s Ajax API, making GET and
          POST JSON requests. We’ll then cover jQuery extensions and how to
          use encapsulation to ensure you’re being a good web citizen.
          Finally, we’ll take a look at a practical example: creating a Growl
          jQuery plug-in.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. CSS Extensions">Appendix B</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">Appendix B covers Less, a superset of CSS that extends its
          syntax with variables, mixins, operations, and nested rules. Less
          can really reduce the amount of CSS you need to write—especially
          when it comes to CSS3 vendor–specific rules. This appendix covers
          Less’s major syntax enhancements and how to use the command line’s
          tools and JavaScript library to compile Less files down to
          CSS.</p></dd><dt class="calibre8"><span class="calibre1"><a class="ulink" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. CSS3 Reference">Appendix C</a></span></dt><dd class="calibre9"><p class="calibre3">The last appendix is a CSS3 reference. It provides a bit of
          background on CSS3, explains vendor prefixes, and then takes you
          through the major additions to the specification. Among other CSS3
          features, this appendix covers rounded corners,
          <code class="literal">rgba</code> colors, drop shadows, gradients,
          transitions, and transformations. It ends with a discussion about
          graceful degradation using Modernizr and a practical example of
          using the new box-sizing specification.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div>

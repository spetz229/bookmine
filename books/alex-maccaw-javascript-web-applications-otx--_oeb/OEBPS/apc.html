<div class="book" title="Appendix C. CSS3 Reference"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="appendix---css3-reference" class="calibre1"></a>Appendix C. CSS3 Reference</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="index-478D064KP1W" class="calibre1"></a><a id="index-511T438RB4W" class="calibre1"></a>Producing beautiful interfaces in CSS2.1 was pretty tricky
  because it usually involved a lot of extra markup, images, and JavaScript.
  CSS3 attempts to solve these problems, providing a variety of really useful
  attributes and selectors to help you create amazing user interfaces.</p><p class="calibre3">Often, when designing web applications, I skip Photoshop and jump
  straight into CSS3 and HTML5. Now that there are these powerful
  technologies, designing static PSD mockups seems a bit redundant. Clients
  also tend to appreciate this because they can interact with an HTML
  prototype of the product, getting a much better feel for the user
  experience.</p><p class="calibre3">“But what about older browsers?” I hear you cry! Surely CSS3 isn’t
  ready for prime time yet? Well, the answer to that is <span class="calibre1"><em class="calibre4">graceful
  degradation</em></span><a id="I_indexterm_d1e16086" class="calibre1"></a>. Older browsers <a id="I_indexterm_d1e16092" class="calibre1"></a>will ignore your CSS3 styles, falling back to the standard
  ones. For example, in Chrome, your users will see the application in its
  full glory, gradients and all, whereas in IE7, the application will be just
  as functional, only a lot less pretty.</p><p class="calibre3">As for Internet Explorer 6, I advocate you to drop support altogether.
  Facebook, Amazon, and Google are all starting to drop support, and the small
  percentage of IE6 users just doesn’t make the effort to support it viable.
  The Web is moving on, and older technologies need to be dropped.</p><p class="calibre3">The major browsers are IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Chrome and
  Safari have a different JavaScript engine, but they share the same rendering
  engine, WebKit. Although there are subtle differences between the two
  browsers—they use different graphics libraries—fixes to Chrome are pushed
  upstream to WebKit, and vice versa.</p><p class="calibre3">Microsoft released IE9 as this book was being written. Hopefully it
  will be widely adopted before too long, because it’s quite an improvement on
  its previous browsers, and it includes a lot of CSS3 support.</p><p class="calibre3">It’s an incredibly exciting time to be a frontend developer, and you
  should consider using these new technologies immediately.</p><div class="book" title="Prefixes"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect1_d1e16106" class="calibre1"></a>Prefixes</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="I_indexterm_d1e16110" class="calibre1"></a><a id="I_indexterm_d1e16115" class="calibre1"></a>The browser vendors were implementing CSS3 before it had
    been completely standardized. For that reason, while the syntax is still
    in flux, some CSS3 styles have a browser-specific prefix. For example, the
    CSS3 gradient style is different in Firefox and <span class="calibre1">Safari. Firefox uses <code class="literal">-moz-linear-gradient</code>, and Safari (WebKit) uses
    <code class="literal">-webkit-</code></span><span class="calibre1"><code class="literal">gradient</code>; both
    syntaxes are prefixed with the vendor type.</span></p><p class="calibre3">The different prefixes used are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Chrome: <code class="literal">-webkit-</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Safari: <code class="literal">-webkit-</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Firefox: <code class="literal">-moz-</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">IE: <code class="literal">-ms-</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre3">Opera: <code class="literal">-o-</code></p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre3">For the moment, you should specify styles with the vendor prefix and
    then without. This is to ensure that when the browsers remove the prefix
    and switch over to the standardized CSS3 specification, your styles will
    still work:</p><pre class="screen">#prefix-example {
  -moz-box-shadow: 0 3px 5px #FFF;
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 3px 5px #FFF;
  box-shadow: 0 3px 5px #FFF;
}</pre></div></div></div>

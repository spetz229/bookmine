    some parts in African huts without electricity and Internet, others in
    Japanese washitsus overlooking temples and blossoming trees, and some even
    on remote Cambodian islands. In short, I had a great time writing this,
    and I hope reading it gives you just as much pleasure.</p><p class="calibre3">Some people deserve their share of the blame. Thanks go to Stuart
    Eccles, Tim Malbon, Ben Griffins, and Sean O’Halpin for giving me the
    chances and opportunity to find my passion; and to James Adam, Paul
    Battley, and Jonah Fox for mentoring and putting up with my
    asininities.</p><p class="calibre3">Thanks also to the technical reviewers, who really helped shape the
    book: Henrik Joreteg, Justin Meyer, Lea Verou, Addy Osmani, Alex Barbara,
    Max Williams, and Julio Cesar Ody.</p><p class="calibre3">Most importantly, thanks to my parents for their unwavering
    support.</p></div></div>

We live in a real-time
  world, so it’s only natural that the Web is moving in that direction. Users
  clamor for real-time communication, data, and search. Our expectations for
  how quickly the Internet should deliver us information have changed—delays
  of minutes in breaking news stories are now unacceptable. Major companies
  like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been quick to catch onto this,
  offering real-time functionality in their services. This is a growing trend
  that’s only going to get bigger.</p><div class="book" title="Real Time’s History"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title1"><a id="I_sect18_d1e7391" class="calibre1"></a>Real Time’s History</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre3"><a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7395" class="calibre1"></a><a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7400" class="calibre1"></a>Traditionally, the Web was built around the request/response
    model of HTTP: a client requests a web page, the server delivers it, and
    nothing happens again until the client requests another page. Then, Ajax
    came along and made web pages feel a bit more dynamic—requests to the
    server could now be made in the background. However, if the server had
    additional data for clients, there was no way of notifying them after the
    page was loaded; live data couldn’t be pushed to clients.</p><p class="calibre3">Lots of solutions were devised. The most basic was polling: just
    asking the server over and over again for any new information. This gave
    users the perception of real time. In practice, it introduced latency and
    performance problems because servers had to process a huge number of
    connections a second, with both TCP handshake and HTTP overheads. Although
    polling is still used, it’s by no means ideal.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, more advanced transports were devised under the umbrella term
    Comet. These techniques consisted of iframes (forever frames),
    xhr-multipart, htmlfiles, and long polling. With long polling, a client
    opens an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) connection to a server that never closes,
    leaving the client hanging. When the server has new data, it’s duly sent
    down the connection, which then closes. The whole process then repeats
    itself, essentially allowing server push.</p><p class="calibre3">Comet techniques <a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7412" class="calibre1"></a>were unstandardized hacks, and as such, browser
    compatibility was a problem. On top of that, there were performance
    issues. Every connection to the server contained a full set of HTTP
    headers, so if you needed low latency, this could be quite a problem.
    That’s not to knock Comet, though—it was a valid solution when there were
    no other alternatives.</p><p class="calibre3">Browser plug-ins, such as Adobe Flash and Java, were also used for
    server push.<a id="I_indexterm8_d1e7418" class="calibre1"></a> These would allow raw TCP socket connections with servers,
    which could be used for pushing real-time data out to clients. The caveat
    was that these plug-ins weren’t guaranteed to be installed, and they often
    suffered from firewall issues, especially on corporate networks.</p><p class="calibre3">There are now alternative solutions as part of the HTML5
    specification. However, it will be a while before all the browsers,
    particularly Internet Explorer, are up to speed with the current
    developments. Until then, Comet will remain a useful tool in any frontend
    developer’s arsenal.</p></div></div></div>

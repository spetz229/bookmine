      PostgreSQL. As of Version 0.8, SQL execution is performed with either a dynamic or persistent connection to the PostgreSQL
      RDBMS.</p><p class="calibre9">LXP also supports a few more advanced techniques commonly found in programming languages, such as variable setting,
      insertion and substitution, arrays, branching logic, loop iteration, and a basic search-and-replace variable formatting
      interface.</p><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="AEN21171" class="calibre8">Content Inclusion and Management</a></h2><p class="calibre9">The essential concept of content inclusion is that other files, or sources of data, can be
        <span><i class="EMPHASIS">included</i></span> (e.g., inserted or embedded) within a requested document's HTML output. Instructing an LXP
        document to include another file means that the output from that included file will appear inline, as if it had been part
        of the originally requested document itself. This can aid both the efficiency and maintainability of a large, dynamic web
        site.</p><p class="calibre9">LXP can natively include a variety of external files, from plain HTML, to XML, to token-delimited flat files.
        However, one of the strongest features of LXP's content inclusion capability is that LXP can embed
        <span><i class="EMPHASIS">any</i></span> content type that your Apache web server has been configured to handle.</p><p class="calibre9">Earlier incarnations of LXP had somewhat rigid support for the inclusion of PHP scripts. As of Version 0.8,
        however, LXP can include any available content type via Apache subrequests. This allows you to embed server-side
        documents written in languages including, but not limited to, <span><i class="EMPHASIS">PHP</i></span>, <span><i class="EMPHASIS">Perl</i></span>, and
        any executable CGI application. Any CGI arguments or LXP variables available to LXP are passed on to the included
        document as if it had been called directly with those variables through an HTTP request.</p><p class="calibre9">LXP also utilizes <span><i class="EMPHASIS">expat</i></span>, a nonvalidating XML parsing library. While <span><i class="EMPHASIS">expat</i></span>
        doesn't validate your XML based on a DTD, the XML to be parsed <span><i class="EMPHASIS">must at least</i></span> be
        <span><i class="EMPHASIS">well-formed</i></span> (e.g., no invalid characters, mismatched tags, etc.).</p><p class="calibre9">The XML parser implementation was written into LXP with support for easy RSS/RDF formats in particular
        (<span><i class="EMPHASIS">Rich Site Summary</i></span> and <span><i class="EMPHASIS">Resource Description Framework</i></span>, respectively). These
        file formats are available on popular web sites to provide a short summary of the information supplied on their site to
        other hosts that link to their content (e.g., the headlines from a news site, along with URL information).</p><p class="calibre9">LXP's XML method is evolving into a more generalized tool, but it can presently be used to a limited extent with
        any well-formed XML.</p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="AEN21189" class="calibre8">Direct SQL Methods and PostgreSQL Connectivity</a></h2><p class="calibre9">LXP provides both dynamic and persistent PostgreSQL database connectivity, allowing for versatile execution of SQL
        statements. The <span><i class="EMPHASIS">SQL inclusion method</i></span> allows the execution of a query from within an LXP document.
        Once a query is executed, its results are passed to the LXP parser for inline formatting. These values can either be
        displayed immediately, or set as variables for use later in the document.</p><p class="calibre9">The persistent connections, inline formatting, and direct SQL query tags lend LXP unparalleled ease of use in the
        arrangement of content from a database. An example use of the LXP database connectivity can be found in the
        <span><i class="EMPHASIS">Fingerless</i></span> LXP package, a simple and flexible weblog implementation.</p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="FINGERLESS" class="calibre8">Fingerless</a></h2><p class="calibre9"><span><i class="EMPHASIS">Fingerless</i></span>, first introduced in LXP 0.7, is an LXP-based weblog system, similar to those seen
        on sites such as <span><i class="EMPHASIS">Slashdot.org</i></span> and <span><i class="EMPHASIS">Kuro5hin.org</i></span>.</p><p class="calibre9">As of the 0.8 release, the Fingerless implementation has been re-factored into an external package utilizing
        general LXP tags and persistent SQL connectivity.  As such, this documentation will not cover the now deprecated
        Fingerless builtin methods, which will be removed from the LXP core in the next major release. For an example of a web
        site running Fingerless, however, visit: <span><i class="EMPHASIS">http://www.thelinuxreview.com</i></span>.</p></div></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><hr width="100%" class="calibre6"/><table summary="Footer navigation table" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="calibre"><tr class="calibre1"><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre3"><a href="lxp.htm" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td><td width="34%" valign="top" class="calibre4"><a href="book1.htm" accesskey="H">Home</a></td><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre5"><a href="x21206.htm" accesskey="N">Next</a></td></tr><tr class="calibre1"><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre3">LXP</td><td width="34%" valign="top" class="calibre4"><a href="lxp.htm" accesskey="U">Up</a></td><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre5">Installing and Configuring LXP</td></tr></table></div></div>

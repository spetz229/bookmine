  developed in various forms since 1977. It began as a project named Ingres at the University of California at
  Berkeley. Ingres itself was later developed commercially by Relational
  Technologies/Ingres Corporation.</p><p class="calibre9">In 1986 another team led by Michael Stonebraker from Berkeley continued the development of
  the Ingres code to create an object-relational database system called Postgres. In 1996, due to a
  new open source effort and the enhanced functionality of the software, Postgres was renamed to
  PostgreSQL, after a brief stint as Postgres95. The PostgreSQL project is still under very active
  development worldwide from a team of open source developers and contributors.</p><p class="calibre9">PostgreSQL is widely considered to be the most advanced open source database system in the
  world.  It provides many features (which are discussed in more detail in <a href="x293.htm">the Section called <i class="EMPHASIS">PostgreSQL Feature Set</i></a>") that
  are traditionally seen only in enterprise-caliber commercial products.</p><div class="NAVHEADER"><h1 class="calibre7"><a name="AEN226" class="calibre8">Open Source Free Version</a></h1><p class="calibre9">PostgreSQL is an open source project. Open source by definition means that you can obtain
    the source code, use the program, and modify it freely without the confines of proprietary
    software. In the database world, open source means that you have honest access to benchmarking
    numbers and performance statistics, which companies such as Oracle prohibit. Open source also
    means that you are free to modify PostgreSQL to fit your particular needs.</p><p class="calibre9">However, there is a misconception that since open source software is free from distribution
    restrictions, it is always free of cost to your company. This is not necessarily the case.
    It is true that you can, without external cost, download and install open source software, but
    there will always be costs associated with the time and energy your company puts into support
    and research of the application. As such, if you do not have those resources to spend, there
    are several commercial vendors and consultants who deal specifically with PostgreSQL.</p><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="AEN232" class="calibre8">Commercial PostgreSQL Products</a></h2><p class="calibre9">The Red Hat version of PostgreSQL is called Red Hat Database
      and is a very new product to the database market. Red Hat Database
      is based on the community-released open source version, PostgreSQL 7.1.
      Red Hat Database currently supports Linux only, preferably Red Hat Linux 7.1.</p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="AEN238" class="calibre8">Open Source Versus Commercial Products</a></h2><p class="calibre9">The open source version of PostgreSQL only includes the database-management system and
      the associated programming interfaces. The Red Hat version of PostgreSQL
      includes a graphical installer and limited support for the installation.</p><p class="calibre9">The main factor in deciding whether to use the open source
      version of PostgreSQL or a commercially packaged version
      should be your business requirements. If you have a knowledgeable on-site
      technical-support staff, the community version may do well for you.
      However, if you need installation, configuration, and management support,
      you may be better served by purchasing a commercial version of
      PostgreSQL.</p><p class="calibre9">If you prefer to do business with smaller consulting companies, we have compiled a
      modest list of professional companies providing support for PostgreSQL in <a href="c208.htm#COMMERCIALSUPPORT">the Section called <i class="EMPHASIS">Commercial Support</i></a>."</p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="THEBOTTOMLINE" class="calibre8">The Bottom Line</a></h2><p class="calibre9">Marketing would suggest that a commercial version of
      PostgreSQL is somehow objectively superior to an open source
      version of PostgreSQL. In reality, this is not the case. When
      deciding what version of PostgreSQL you are going to run, you need
      only be aware of your own needs.  For example, are you going to need
      installation support? Is a graphical installation important to you? If
      they are, then you should probably purchase a commercial version of
      PostgreSQL. However, if you or one of your staff are comfortable with
      compiling and configuring source code, the open source version could
      be more applicable to you.</p><p class="calibre9">There are two additional questions you may want to ask. Do you need printed
      documentation and are you willing to pay for PostgreSQL? The commercial distribution
      comes with printed documentation. However, if you are reading this book, we hope you
      won't need the additional documentation. The other question relates to cost. Red Hat Database is priced at
      $2,295.00.</p><p class="calibre9">The most important thing to remember when deciding on which version of PostgreSQL to
      use is this (from a perspective of general usage and feature availability): <span><i class="EMPHASIS">there
      is no practical difference between the open source and the commercial versions.</i></span></p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="COMMERCIALSUPPORT" class="calibre8">Commercial Support</a></h2><p class="calibre9">Outside of Red Hat, there are many companies that provide consulting
      services to the PostgreSQL community. The following is a small list of consultants

      mailing lists. There are several user mailing lists to which you can subscribe, segregated by
      topic (e.g., <span><i class="EMPHASIS">pgsql-general</i></span>, <span><i class="EMPHASIS">pgsql-hackers</i></span>, etc.).
      The mailing lists for PostgreSQL users are quite thorough, covering everything from general
      discussion to support on developing with PostgreSQL programming interfaces.

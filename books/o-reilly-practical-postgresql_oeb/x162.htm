    editing support, Michael Holloway for clutch editing, Corwin Light-Williams for his JDBC chapter, and of course, a chubby
    little Penguin named Tux. We would also like to take a moment to thank our families; it has been a long road and we
    appreciate your love and patience.</p><p class="calibre9">John would like to thank his parents for their lifelong support, and for purchasing him computer equipment in his
    formative years for better reasons than playing Wolfenstein 3D until 2:00 in the morning.</p><p class="calibre9">Joshua would like to thank God for providing a family with enough patience to tolerate the long hours needed to
    complete this book, and specifically his son, Joshua A, for being the coolest kid on the planet.</p><p class="calibre9">Last but not least, we would like to thank O'Reilly and Associates for their help in creating this book, and the
    PostgreSQL community for their technical assistance (particularly Tom Lane), and for providing such a great product.</p></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><hr width="100%" class="calibre6"/><table summary="Footer navigation table" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="calibre"><tr class="calibre1"><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre3"><a href="x106.htm" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td><td width="34%" valign="top" class="calibre4"><a href="book1.htm" accesskey="H">Home</a></td><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre5"><a href="x168.htm" accesskey="N">Next</a></td></tr><tr class="calibre1"><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre3">Conventions Used in This Book</td><td width="34%" valign="top" class="calibre4"><a href="f35.htm" accesskey="U">Up</a></td><td width="33%" valign="top" class="calibre5">Comments and Questions</td></tr></table></div></div>

Many of the
  PostgreSQL capabilities are not enabled, by default.  For example, support for the TCL language is a feature that must be
  explicitly requested during compile-time.  As there are many other features that are not configured by default, we will cover
  the various flags and options you may use to enable them when compiling PostgreSQL.  It is important that you carefully read
  through all the steps in this process before beginning installation.  </p><p class="calibre9">This chapter will walk you through the installation steps on a Linux/UNIX-style platform. Our installation platform is
  Linux, but these instructions should be compatible with most current UNIX platforms.</p><div class="NAVHEADER"><blockquote class="NOTE"><p class="calibre9"><b class="calibre10">Note: </b>Although PostgreSQL is capable of running on a Win32 platform, this book does not cover installation on Windows. The
    Win32 version of PostgreSQL requires the Cygwin environment and will not operate independently within Win32. Although Cygwin
    can be useful in many situations, the use of PostgreSQL in a Cygwin environment is not recommended.</p></blockquote></div><div class="NAVHEADER"><h1 class="calibre7"><a name="AEN375" class="calibre8">Preparing for Installation</a></h1><p class="calibre9">The installation of PostgreSQL is not difficult. However, there are some software requirements that you will need for
    the PostgreSQL compilation. All of the requirements — outside of the PostgreSQL source code — are GNU tools. If
    you are running Linux, there is a good chance that the tools are already installed.  If you are running a BSD derivative,
    such as FreeBSD or MacOS X, you may have to download the tools.</p><p class="calibre9">If you find that you are missing any of the required components, first check your vendor's web site for the packages;
    otherwise, you may download them from <span><i class="EMPHASIS">http://www.gnu.org</i></span>.  It is also essential that you have enough
    disk space available to unpack and compile the source code on the filesystem to which you install.  Disk-space requirements
    are discussed in <a href="c360.htm#DISKSPACE">the Section called <i class="EMPHASIS">Disk Space</i></a>."</p><div class="NAVHEADER"><h2 class="SECT"><a name="AEN381" class="calibre8">Required Software Packages</a></h2><p class="calibre9">You will most likely have some of the required software packages already installed on your system, if not all of

      PostgreSQL could be considered fat free.  However, PostgreSQL is a database, and as with any database, the requirements
      will grow as you continue to use PostgreSQL.</p><p class="calibre9">On an average Linux machine, you will need approximately 50 MB of hard-drive space to unpack the source and another
      60 MB of hard drive space to compile the source. If you choose to run the regression tests, you will need an additional 30
      MB. Depending on the configuration options you choose, PostgreSQL can take anywhere from 8 to 15 MB of hard drive space

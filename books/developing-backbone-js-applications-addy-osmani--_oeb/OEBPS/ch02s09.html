        Scaffolding can assist in expediting how quickly you can begin a
        new application by creating the basic files required for a
        project automatically. If you enjoy the idea of automated MVC
        scaffolding using Backbone, I’m happy to recommend checking out
        a tool called
        <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/brunch/brunch">Brunch</a>.
      </p><p class="calibre6">
        It works very well with Backbone, Underscore, jQuery and
        CoffeeScript and is even used by companies such as Red Bull and
        Jim Beam. You may have to update any third party dependencies
        (e.g. latest jQuery or Zepto) when using it, but other than that
        it should be fairly stable to use right out of the box.
      </p><p class="calibre6">
        Brunch can be installed via the nodejs package manager and is
        easy to get started with. If you happen to use Vim or Textmate
        as your editor of choice, you’ll be happy to know that there are
        Brunch bundles available for both.

      using?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre6">
        Andrew de Andrade has pointed out that DocumentCloud themselves
        usually only use a single router in most of their applications.
        You’re very likely to not require more than one or two routers
        in your own projects as the majority of your application routing
        can be kept organized in a single controller without it getting
        unwieldy.

        If you find yourself unsure of whether or not your application
        is too large to use Backbone, I recommend reading
        <a class="ulink" href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/jqcon-largescalejs-2012/">my
        post</a> on building large-scale jQuery &amp; JavaScript
        applications or reviewing my slides on client-side MVC
        architecture options. In both, I cover alternative solutions and
        my thoughts on the suitability of current MVC solutions for
        scaled application development.
      </p><p class="calibre6">
        Backbone can be used for building both trivial and complex
        applications as demonstrated by the many examples Ashkenas has
        been referencing in the Backbone documentation. As with any MVC
        framework however, it’s important to dedicate time towards
        planning out what models and views your application really
        needs. Diving straight into development without doing this can
        result in either spaghetti code or a large refactor later on and
        it’s best to avoid this where possible.
      </p><p class="calibre6">
        At the end of the day, the key to building large applications is
        not to build large applications in the first place. If you
        however find Backbone doesn’t cut it for your requirements I
        strongly recommend checking out JavaScriptMVC or SproutCore as
        these both offer a little more than Backbone out of the box.
        Dojo and Dojo Mobile may also be of interest as these have also
        been used to build significantly complex apps by other
        developers.

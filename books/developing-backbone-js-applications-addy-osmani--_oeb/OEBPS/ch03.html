    In this section of the book, we’re going to take a look at
    developing RESTful applications using Backbone.js and modern
    technology stacks. When the data for your back-end is exposed
    through a purely RESTful API, tasks such as retrieving (GET),
    creating (POST), updating (PUT) and deleting (DELETE) models are
    made easy through Backbone’s Model API. This API is so intuitive in
    fact that switching from storing records in a local data-store (e.g
    localStorage) to a database/noSQL data-store is a lot simpler than
    you may think.

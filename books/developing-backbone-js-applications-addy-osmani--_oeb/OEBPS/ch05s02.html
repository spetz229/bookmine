      QUnit is a powerful JavaScript test suite written by jQuery team
      member <a class="ulink" href="http://bassistance.de/">Jörn Zaefferer</a>
      and used by many large open-source projects (such as jQuery and
      Backbone.js) to test their code. It’s both capable of testing
      standard JavaScript code in the browser as well as code on the
      server-side (where environments supported include Rhino, V8 and
      SpiderMonkey). This makes it a robust solution for a large number
      of use-cases.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      Quite a few Backbone.js contributors feel that QUnit is a better
      introductory framework for testing if you don’t wish to start off
      with Jasmine and BDD right away. As we’ll see later on in this
      chapter, QUnit can also be combined with third-party solutions
      such as SinonJS to produce an even more powerful testing solution
      supporting spies and mocks, which some say is preferable over
      Jasmine.
    </p><p class="calibre6">
      My personal recommendation is that it’s worth comparing both
      frameworks and opting for the solution that you feel the most
      comfortable with.

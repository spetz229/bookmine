accept comment or notification text: check in, lock stealing, and
(under circumstances to be explained later in the chapter) file
registration. In each case, the operation is on hold until you type
<span><strong class="calibre5">C-c C-c</strong></span> to commit the comment
buffer. You can enter a comment right away and finish the operation,
or you can go off and do something else. VC waits patiently to commit
until you are ready. If you delete the pop-up buffer, the operation
is quietly scrubbed.</p><p class="copyright">The comment buffer is a plain-text buffer. However, each time you
commit a comment buffer, the contents are saved to a new slot in a
ring of comment buffers. You can cycle backwards in the ring with
<span><strong class="calibre5">M-p</strong></span> and forward with <span><strong class="calibre5">M-n</strong></span>, or you can search for text backwards in
the ring with <span><strong class="calibre5">M-r</strong></span> and forward with
<span><strong class="calibre5">M-s</strong></span>. By design, these are the same
keys you can use to navigate an Emacs minibuffer command history. By
far the most commonly used of these commands is <span><strong class="calibre5">M-p</strong></span>. Being able to recall and edit the last
change comment is often useful since it's common to
make a series of related changes.</p></div></div>

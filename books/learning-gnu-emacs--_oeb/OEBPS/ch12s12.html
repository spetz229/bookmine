the following maxim: <span><em class="calibre7">to use VC effectively, check in your
changes early and often!</em></span> Of course, when you are working
as part of a team of developers, you do need to take care to check in
only a consistent and working set of files each time.
There's nothing quite equal to the frustration of
discovering that you can no longer compile and test your own code
because someone else has checked in a fragmentary or broken piece of
theirs.</p><p class="copyright">If you're used to version control interfaces that
are as clumsy and difficult as bare SCCS, RCS, or—to a lesser
extent—CVS, your reflexes may prevent you from getting the most
leverage out of VC. You probably won't commit often;
you're not used to being able to instantly get
status reports on a whole subtree of files.</p><p class="copyright">It's worth a little thought and effort to reeducate
yourself. You'll find that, instead of being an
irritating minor chore, version control under VC can be tremendously
liberating. By checking changes in often, you'll
find you can afford to experiment more, because
you'll know how to revert to a known good state
quickly if need be.</p></div></div>

            <a id="gnu3-CHP-12-ITERM-2909" class="calibre2"></a>as a
front-end for multiple version control systems. The code that
actually runs the version control tools is carefully isolated from
the user-level package logic in such a way that plugging in new
systems is not very hard. VC's author originally
wrote it to handle SCCS and RCS; CVS support was added later, by a
different person, without much difficulty, and Subversion support was
an even simpler variant of the CVS code.</p><p class="copyright">There are a couple of extensions to Emacs for users of ClearCase, a
popular commercial project-management system. Whether this code is
accepted into the GNU Emacs distribution, considering the
FSF's hostile attitude towards non-freeware, is
another question. So far they have not been, but you can obtain the
packages over the internet. At the time of this writing, the best
choice appears to be <code class="calibre21">clearcase.el</code>. The author of
the first implementation, <code class="calibre21">VC-ClearCase</code>, has even
stated that he's switched over to
<code class="calibre21">clearcase.el</code>. The current download site is
<a class="calibre2" href="http://members.verizon.net/~vze24fr2/EmacsClearCase/">http://members.verizon.net/~vze24fr2/EmacsClearCase/</a>.
If it's moved by the time you read this, hopefully a
Google search will steer you in the right direction.</p><p class="copyright">By the time you read this book, then, your VC may well handle
additional systems besides the ones we have described here (though
CVS and Subversion are likely to remain the most popular ones for the
foreseeable future). If you are a skilled Emacs Lisp programmer (or
would like to become one) and have your own favorite version control
system, by all means hack the source codeâ€”extend VC to use it,
and share your results so that everyone benefits.</p></div></div>

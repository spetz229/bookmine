only a sample of what it does. Many features have been left out, and
more features are added all the time. Some topics, however, are not
covered:<a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1458" class="calibre2"></a>

         </p><div class="book"><dl class="copyright"><dt class="book"><span>Compatibility modes</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">GNU Emacs provides compatibility modes for <span><strong class="calibre5">vi</strong></span>, for example. We've left a
discussion of these modes out. If you really want to use <span><strong class="calibre5">vi</strong></span> or another editor, do so.
You're better off getting to know Emacs on its own
terms rather than pretending it is something else.</p></dd><dt class="book"><span>Many programming language modes</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">In this book, we discuss editing modes for C++, Java, Lisp, Perl, and
SQL. There are many modes for other languages, including rare
languages like Scheme. There's no way we could
discuss everything.</p></dd><dt class="book"><span>Advanced Lisp programming</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">GNU Emacs incorporates a complete Lisp interpreter. We give a very
basic and brief introduction to Emacs Lisp; <a class="calibre2" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Emacs Lisp Programming">Chapter 11</a> should be enough to get you started, but it
really only scratches the surface. We recommend the
FSF's <span><em class="calibre7">Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual</em></span>, now included in the Emacs distribution.</p></dd><dt class="book"><span>Using Emacs to access the Internet</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">When our last edition came out, it was common to use Emacs to access
Internet resources or read email. Now that isn't so
common; better mailers, browsers, and other tools are commonly in use
on all platforms.</p></dd><dt class="book"><span>Unicode support</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">At present, Emacs is on its way to full Unicode support; that is the
most important change slated for the next major release. At this
writing, Unicode support is spotty.</p></dd><dt class="book"><span>Games and amusements</span></dt><dd class="calibre20"><p class="copyright">GNU Emacs includes an eclectic bunch of games and amusements,
including the ability to pipe random quotations from Zippy the
Pinhead into the famous "Eliza"
pseudopsychoanalyst. Emacs 21 includes a Games menu under Tools with
several cool ways to waste time in Emacs (and it
doesn't even include Emacs's
version of pong, one of our favorites). Alas, we had to draw the line
somewhere. <a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1462" class="calibre2"></a>

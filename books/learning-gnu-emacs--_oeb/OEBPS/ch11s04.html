            <a id="gnu3-CHP-11-ITERM-2820" class="calibre2"></a>see how all these tools can be
put together in really powerful ways. Most of the rest of the chapter
consists of examples of building relatively real and useful new
features for Emacs. You can use them as learning tools for how to
build your own, and you may be able to use them as-is, or with a
little tweaking, in your own daily work.</p><p class="copyright">The example we're about to look at is something that
one of the authors developed over a decade ago to help with the
tedium of creating new files in development projects where a certain
amount of structure and standard documentation were always needed.
Many coding and writing projects have this characteristic; each file
needs some boilerplate, but it needs to be adjusted to the details of
the file. Emacs turned out to be very much up to the task of
automating a lot of the drudge work, and this template system has
been heavily used ever since.</p><p class="copyright">Most of the code in this example should already make sense to you. A
couple of aspects that will be explained more thoroughly in the next
section about programming a major mode. In particular,
don't worry too much yet about exactly what a
"hook" function is, or <span><strong class="calibre5">funcall</strong></span>. For now it's
sufficient to know that the <span><strong class="calibre5">file-not-found-hook</strong></span> allows us to run code when
the user uses <span><strong class="calibre5">find-file</strong></span> to open a
file that doesn't exist yet (exactly the time at
which we'd like to offer our template services).</p><p class="copyright">Before launching into the code, it's worth looking
at an example of it in action. You'd set up your
template by creating a file named
<span><em class="calibre7">file-template-java</em></span> at the

regular expression facilities, which is no surprise. The first
section sets up some variables that configure the operation of the
template system. <span><strong class="calibre5">template-file-name</strong></span>
determines the file name (or prefix) that is used to search for
templates; the default value of <span><strong class="calibre5">file-template</strong></span> is probably fine. <span><strong class="calibre5">template-replacements-alist</strong></span> sets up the
standard placeholders, and the mechanism by which they get replaced
by appropriate values. Adding entries to this list is one way to
extend the system. Each entry consists of the placeholder to be
replaced, followed by the Lisp function to be executed to produce its
replacement. The way this function can be stored in a list and
executed when appropriate later is one of the great things about Lisp
and is discussed in more depth in the calculator mode example in the
next section. The placeholders supported are:</p><div class="book"><dl class="copyright"><dt class="book"><span>

searching the directory hierarchy above the file being created,
looking for a file with the right name to be considered a file
template (if <span><strong class="calibre5">template-file-name</strong></span> has
been left at its default value, this looks for either a file named
<span><em class="calibre7">file-template</em></span> or
<span><em class="calibre7">file-template-ext</em></span> where <span><em class="calibre7">ext</em></span>
is the extension at the end of the name of the file being created).
It just keeps lopping the last directory off the path in which
it's looking, starting with the location of the new
file, and seeing if it can read a file with one of those names in the
current directory, until it runs out of directories.</p><p class="copyright">The function <span><strong class="calibre5">template-file-not-found-hook</strong></span> is the
"main program" of the template
system. It gets "hooked in" to the
normal Emacs <span><strong class="calibre5">find-file</strong></span> process, and
called whenever <span><strong class="calibre5">find-file</strong></span>
doesn't find the file the user asked for (in other
words, a new file is being created). It uses <span><strong class="calibre5">condition-case</strong></span> (a mechanism similar to
exception handling in C++ and Java) to make sure it gets a chance to
clean up after itself if the user cancels the process of filling in
the template file. It checks whether the template file can be found,
asks users if they want to use it, and (if they do) loads it into the
new buffer and performs the placeholder substitutions. For an
explanation of the list manipulation and <span><strong class="calibre5">funcall</strong></span> code that makes the substitutions
work, read the discussion of Calculator mode in the next section.
Finally, it jumps to the beginning of the new buffer and marks it as
unchanged (because, as far as users are concerned,
it's a brand new buffer on which
they've not yet had to expend any effort).</p><p class="copyright">Immediately after the function definition is the chunk of code that
hooks it into the <span><strong class="calibre5">find-file</strong></span>
mechanism. The <span><strong class="calibre5">file-not-found-hooks</strong></span>
is a variable that Emacs uses to keep track of things to do when a
requested file is not found. (Giving you opportunities to change or
enhance normal behavior through
"hooks" is a wonderful trait of
Emacs that is discussed in more depth following the Calculator mode
example later in this chapter.) Our code checks to make sure
it's not already hooked up (so you
don't end up having it run twice or more if you
re-load the library file during an Emacs session), and then installs
our hook at the end of the list if it's not there.</p><p class="copyright">The rest of the file is helper functions to handle the more complex
placeholders. <span><strong class="calibre5">template-insert-java-package</strong></span> figures out the
value that should replace <code class="calibre21">%package%</code>, while
<span><strong class="calibre5">template-insert-class-name</strong></span> figures
out the Java class name that replaces <code class="calibre21">%class%</code>.</p><p class="copyright">The last function call in the file, <code class="calibre21">(provide
'template)</code>, records the fact that a
"feature" named
"template" has been loaded
successfully. The <span><strong class="calibre5">provide</strong></span> function
works with <span><strong class="calibre5">require</strong></span> to allow
libraries to be loaded just once. When the function
<code class="calibre21">(require</code> '<code class="calibre21">template)</code> is
executed, Emacs checks whether the feature
"template" has ever been provided.
If it has, it does nothing, otherwise, it calls <span><strong class="calibre5">load-library</strong></span> to load it. It's
a good practice to have your libraries support this mechanism, so
that they can be gracefully and efficiently used by other libraries
through the <span><strong class="calibre5">require</strong></span> mechanism.
You'll find this pattern throughout the Emacs
library sources.</p><div class="book"><br class="book"/><hr class="calibre4"/><div class="book"><p class="copyright"><sup class="calibre6">[<a id="ftn.gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-7" href="#gnu3-CHP-11-FNOTE-7" class="calibre2">7</a>] </sup>The version presented in this example is simplified for reasons

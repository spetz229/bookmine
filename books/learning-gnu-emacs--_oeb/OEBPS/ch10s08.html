customizations. If Emacs isn't doing what you expect
it to, you might want to try inhibiting any global customization file
by starting Emacs with no customization.</p><p class="copyright">You can do that by using
one<a id="gnu3-CHP-10-ITERM-2733" class="calibre2"></a>
of these command-line options when you invoke Emacs.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">
                  <strong class="calibre5"><code class="calibre21">--no-init-file</code></strong>,<strong class="calibre5"><code class="calibre21"> -q</code></strong>
                  <span><em class="calibre7">load neither ~/.emacs nor default.el</em></span>
               </p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">
                  <strong class="calibre5"><code class="calibre21">--no-site-file </code></strong> 
                  <span><em class="calibre7">do not load
site-start.el</em></span>
               </p></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">If you normally start Emacs from an icon, it's
helpful to learn how to start it from the command-line for cases like
this. (You may also want to use the -<code class="calibre21">debug</code> option
sometime to help you figure out what's wrong with
your <span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file if it is messed up following a
change.) <a class="calibre2" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Platform-Specific Considerations">Chapter 13</a> describes how to start Emacs
from the command-line for Mac OS X and Windows users.</p><p class="copyright">You can also inhibit global initialization by creating a one-line
<span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file in your home directory. It should
look exactly like this:</p><a id="I_10_tt563" class="calibre2"></a><pre class="programlisting">(setq inhibit-default-init t) ; no global initialization</pre><p class="copyright">Start Emacs again. This file prevents Emacs from reading its global
initialization file.</p><p class="copyright">There's still one awkward situation: what if
you're sitting down at someone
else's system? You start Emacs, and all of a sudden
you're faced with someone else's
"private" key bindings and
features. Even in this situation, there's a
solution:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Try using the command <span><strong class="calibre5">emacs -q</strong></span>. The
<span><strong class="calibre5">-q</strong></span> option tells Emacs not to read
the user's <span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file before
starting. By doing this, you'll avoid the
user's private customizations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="copyright">Let's say that after this step, you still
don't have your own customizations. If you want to
make Emacs read your <span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file, even when
you're using someone else's
account, give the command <span><strong class="calibre5">emacs -u</strong></span>
                  <span><em class="calibre7">yourname</em></span>. For example: <span><strong class="calibre5">emacs -u deb</strong></span> starts Emacs with the user
Deb's initialization file
(<span><em class="calibre7">/home/deb/.emacs</em></span>).</p></li></ul></div><p class="copyright">The <code class="calibre21">-u</code> option may not work unless
you're on a network where users have a shared home
directory structure. It assumes either that you have the same home
directory on every system, or that you have a different home
directory on every system and an up-to-date
<span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file in all of your home directories.</p><p class="copyright">If all that fails, fear not. You have more options.
Let's take the worst case scenario:
you're on someone else's system and
you can't start Emacs from the command line. Go
ahead and start Emacs. You can temporarily overwrite the other
user's key bindings by loading up your own key
bindings file in a buffer and running it with <span><strong class="calibre5">M-x eval-buffer</strong></span>.</p><p class="copyright">You probably should make a separate file with key bindings and other
variable options rather than using your <span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span>
file. That's because many times your
<span><em class="calibre7">.emacs</em></span> file will have requests to load libraries
that exist on a path that works only from your own system. If you
find yourself jumping to a lot of different machines,
it's worth the effort to create a portable
"rebinding" file and put it
somewhere accessible like a web page or a shared file server. Then
you can evaluate it manually from your current Emacs.</p></div></div>

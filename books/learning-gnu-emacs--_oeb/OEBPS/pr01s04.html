            <a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1455" class="calibre2"></a>You don't need to
know its history to use GNU Emacs, but its origins are an interesting
part of computer history. The Free Software Foundation (FSF), which
maintains and distributes GNU Emacs, has become an important part of
computer culture.</p><p class="copyright">
            <a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1456" class="calibre2"></a>A long
time ago (1975) at MIT, Richard Stallman wrote the first Emacs
editor. According to the folklore, the original Emacs editor was a
set of macros for TECO, an almost incomprehensible and now obsolete
line editor. The name Emacs stands for "Editing
Macros." Tradition also has it that Emacs is a play
on the name of a favorite ice cream store. Much has happened since
1975. TECO has slipped into deserved obscurity, and Emacs has been
rewritten as an independent program. Several commercial versions of
Emacs appeared, of which Unipress Emacs and CCA Emacs were the most
important. For several years, these commercial implementations were
the Emacs editors you were most likely to run across outside of the
academic world.</p><p class="copyright">Stallman's Emacs became prominent with the birth of
the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the GNU Project in 1984. GNU
stands for "GNU's Not
Unix" and refers to a complete Unix-like operating
system (OS) that Stallman and his associates were building.</p><p class="copyright">Stallman founded the FSF to guarantee that some software would always
remain free. Note that <span><em class="calibre7">Free</em></span> does not necessarily
mean cheap (you may have to pay a fee to cover the cost of
distribution); it most definitely does mean liberated from
restrictions about how it can be used and specifically how it can be
shared.</p><p class="copyright">Stallman is widely recognized as the founder of the free software
movement, which was an important predecessor of the open source
movement. Linux is now the most prominent example of open source
software, and it falls under the GNU Public License or GPL (available
online at <a class="calibre2" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>).
Stallman argues that much of Linux outside the kernel itself is GNU
software and so he refers to it as GNU/Linux. All controversies
aside, Stallman's contribution to the open source
movement cannot be overestimated. GNU software and open source
software distributed under the GPL are a mainstay for developers and
computer users all over the world.</p><p class="copyright">
            <a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-ITERM-1457" class="calibre2"></a>The
FSF was created precisely to distribute programs under terms that
encourage you to share, rather than hoard, software. The GPL is
designed to prevent an unfortunately common practice—namely, a
company taking public domain code, making a few modifications and bug
fixes, and then copyrighting the modified version. Once a company
does this, the program has essentially become private property and
disappears from the public domain. Stallman formed the foundation
because he finds this practice abhorrent. As he explains in the GNU
Manifesto, "I cannot in good conscience sign a
nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement . . . So that
I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to
put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be
able to get along without any software that is not
free." Elsewhere in the manifesto, Stallman calls
sharing software the "fundamental act of friendship
among programmers." Their software is free because
it <span><em class="calibre7">can</em></span> be shared and will
<span><em class="calibre7">always</em></span> be shareable—without restriction.
FSF software is not under restrictive copyright laws, which Stallman
objects to in principle. In fact, he coined the term
<span><em class="calibre7">copyleft</em></span> to describe the FSF's
sharable software base.<sup class="calibre6">[<a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3" href="#ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3" class="calibre2">3</a>]</sup>
         </p><p class="copyright">Since GNU Emacs was first released, many other pieces of the GNU
operating environment have fallen into place: C and C++ compilers
(<span><em class="calibre7">gcc</em></span> and <span><em class="calibre7">g++</em></span>), a very
powerful debugger (<span><em class="calibre7">gdb</em></span>), substitutes for
<span><strong class="calibre5">lex</strong></span> and <span><strong class="calibre5">yacc</strong></span> (called <span><em class="calibre7">flex</em></span> and
<span><em class="calibre7">bison</em></span>, respectively), a Unix shell
(<span><em class="calibre7">bash</em></span>, which stands for
"Bourne-Again Shell"), the Gimp (a
graphics tool comparable to Adobe PhotoShop), GNOME (a desktop
environment for Linux), and many other programs and libraries. Many
important open source projects that originally used variants of the
GPL or other licensing schemes have adopted the GPL as their license,
including Python, Mozilla, and Zope. Author David Wheeler argues that
all open source projects should release their software under a
GPL-compatible license<sup class="calibre6">[<a id="gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-4" href="#ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-4" class="calibre2">4</a>]</sup> (see <a class="calibre2" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html</a>
for his views and some statistics about GPL'd
software). With Linux, GNU tools, and other GPL'd
software, it's possible to have a complete operating
environment consistent with the values set forth by the FSF.</p><div class="book"><br class="book"/><hr class="calibre4"/><div class="book"><p class="copyright"><sup class="calibre6">[<a id="ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3" href="#gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-3" class="calibre2">3</a>] </sup>FSF programs such as Emacs
are often distributed with commercial systems. Even in these cases,
the General Public License guarantees your right to use and give away
their programs without restriction. Of course, the license does not
apply to other proprietary software with which GNU tools have been
shipped.</p></div><div class="book"><p class="copyright"><sup class="calibre6">[<a id="ftn.gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-4" href="#gnu3-PREFACE-2-FNOTE-4" class="calibre2">4</a>] </sup>GPL-compatible is a critical
distinction for many organizations. As our reviewer Mike Trent points
out, many organizations release their software under a modified GPL
because the GPL's license is actually
"viral." That is, if one line of
GPL'd code appears in a project, the entire project
must be GPL'd. This means corporations interested in
protecting their assets but still wanting to share code with the open
source community cannot use the GPL without some modification.</p></div></div></div></div>

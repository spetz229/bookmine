<h3 id="title-IDA5YHCN" class="docSection1Title">Summary</h3>
<p class="docText1">End-of-lifecycle issues for tasks, threads, services, and applications can add complexity to their design and implementation. Java does not provide a preemptive mechanism for cancelling activities or terminating threads. Instead, it provides a cooperative interruption mechanism that can be used to facilitate cancellation, but it is up to you to construct protocols for cancellation and use them consistently. Using <tt class="calibre25">FutureTask</tt> and the <tt class="calibre25">Executor</tt> framework simplifies building cancellable tasks and services.</p>

<h3 id="631532-832" class="docSection1Title">Summary</h3>
<p class="docText1">The <tt class="calibre25">Executor</tt> framework is a powerful and flexible framework for concurrently executing tasks. It offers a number of tuning options, such as policies for creating and tearing down threads, handling queued tasks, and what to do with excess tasks, and provides several hooks for extending its behavior. As in most powerful frameworks, however, there are combinations of settings that do not work well together; some types of tasks require specific execution policies, and some combinations of tuning parameters may produce strange results.</p>

<h3 id="title-IDAAMTIR" class="docSection1Title">Summary</h3>
<p class="docText1">GUI frameworks are nearly always implemented as single-threaded subsystems in which all presentation-related code runs as tasks in an event thread. Because there is only a single event thread, long-running tasks can compromise responsiveness and so should be executed in background threads. Helper classes like <tt class="calibre25">SwingWorker</tt> or the <tt class="calibre25">BackgroundTask</tt> class built here, which provide support for cancellation, progress indication, and completion indication, can simplify the development of long-running tasks that have both GUI and non-GUI components.</p>

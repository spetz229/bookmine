<h3 id="title-IDAVQRXH" class="docSection1Title">16.1. What is a Memory Model, and Why would I Want One?</h3>
<p class="docText1">Suppose one thread assigns a value to <tt class="calibre25">aVariable</tt>:</p>
<div class="docText2"><pre class="calibre36">aVariable = 3;</pre></div><p class="calibre1">Â </p>
<p class="docText1">A memory model addresses the question "Under what conditions does a thread that reads <tt class="calibre25">aVariable</tt> see the value 3?" This may sound like a dumb question, but in the absence of synchronization, there are a number of reasons a threadmight not immediatelyor eversee the results of an operation in another thread. Compilers may generate instructions in a different order than the "obvious" one suggested by the source code, or store variables in registers instead of in memory; processors may execute instructions in parallel or out of order; caches may vary the order in which writes to variables are committed to main memory; and values stored in processor-local caches may not be visible to other processors. These factors can prevent a thread from seeing the most up-to-date value for a variable and can cause memory actions in other threads to appear to happen out of orderif you don't use adequate synchronization.</p>
<p class="docText1">In a single-threaded environment, all these tricks played on our program by the environment are hidden from us and have no effect other than to speed up execution. The Java Language Specification requires the JVM to maintain <span class="docEmphasis">withinthread as-if-serial semantics</span>: as long as the program has the same result as if it were executed in program order in a strictly sequential environment, all these games are permissible. And that's a good thing, too, because these rearrangements are responsible for much of the improvement in computing performance <a name="iddle1196" class="calibre18" id="iddle1196"></a><a name="iddle2620" class="calibre18" id="iddle2620"></a><a name="iddle3195" class="calibre18" id="iddle3195"></a><a name="iddle3200" class="calibre18" id="iddle3200"></a><a name="iddle3201" class="calibre18" id="iddle3201"></a><a name="iddle3205" class="calibre18" id="iddle3205"></a><a name="iddle3222" class="calibre18" id="iddle3222"></a><a name="iddle3223" class="calibre18" id="iddle3223"></a><a name="iddle3263" class="calibre18" id="iddle3263"></a><a name="iddle3264" class="calibre18" id="iddle3264"></a><a name="iddle4160" class="calibre18" id="iddle4160"></a><a name="iddle4233" class="calibre18" id="iddle4233"></a><a name="iddle4234" class="calibre18" id="iddle4234"></a><a name="iddle5102" class="calibre18" id="iddle5102"></a><a name="iddle5103" class="calibre18" id="iddle5103"></a>in recent years. Certainly higher clock rates have contributed to improved performance, but so has increased parallelismpipelined superscalar execution units, dynamic instruction scheduling, speculative execution, and sophisticated multilevel memory caches. As processors have become more sophisticated, so too have compilers, rearranging instructions to facilitate optimal execution and using sophisticated global register-allocation algorithms. And as processor manufacturers transition to multicore processors, largely because clock rates are getting harder to increase economically, hardware parallelism will only increase.</p>
<p class="docText1">In a multithreaded environment, the illusion of sequentiality cannot be maintained without significant performance cost. Sincemost of the time threads within a concurrent application are each "doing their own thing", excessive inter-thread coordination would only slow down the application to no real benefit. It is only when multiple threads share data that it is necessary to coordinate their activities, and the JVM relies on the program to identify when this is happening by using synchronization.</p>
<p class="docText1">The JMM specifies the minimal guarantees the JVM must make about when writes to variables become visible to other threads. It was designed to balance the need for predictability and ease of program development with the realities of implementing high-performance JVMs on a wide range of popular processor architectures. Some aspects of the JMM may be disturbing at first if you are not familiar with the tricks used by modern processors and compilers to squeeze extra performance out of your program.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDA2WRXH" class="docSection2Title">16.1.1. Platform Memory Models</h4>
<p class="docText1">In a shared-memory multiprocessor architecture, each processor has its own cache that is periodically reconciled with main memory. Processor architectures provide varying degrees of <span class="docEmphasis">cache coherence</span>; some provide minimal guarantees that allow different processors to see different values for the same memory location at virtually any time. The operating system, compiler, and runtime (and sometimes, the program, too) must make up the difference between what the hardware provides and what thread safety requires.</p>
<p class="docText1">Ensuring that every processor knows what every other processor is doing at all times is expensive. Most of the time this information is not needed, so processors relax their memory-coherency guarantees to improve performance. An architecture's <span class="docEmphasis">memory model</span> tells programs what guarantees they can expect from the memory system, and specifies the special instructions required (called <span class="docEmphasis">memory barriers</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">fences</span>) to get the additional memory coordination guarantees required when sharing data. In order to shield the Java developer from the differences between memory models across architectures, Java provides its own memory model, and the JVMdeals with the differences between the JMMand the underlying platform's memory model by inserting memory barriers at the appropriate places.</p>
<p class="docText1">One convenient mental model for program execution is to imagine that there is a single order in which the operations happen in a program, regardless of what processor they execute on, and that each read of a variable will see the last write in the execution order to that variable by any processor. This happy, if unrealistic, model is called <span class="docEmphasis">sequential consistency</span>. Software developers often <a name="iddle1040" class="calibre18" id="iddle1040"></a><a name="iddle2775" class="calibre18" id="iddle2775"></a><a name="iddle3203" class="calibre18" id="iddle3203"></a><a name="iddle3204" class="calibre18" id="iddle3204"></a><a name="iddle3856" class="calibre18" id="iddle3856"></a>mistakenly assume sequential consistency, but no modern multiprocessor offers sequential consistency and the JMM does not either. The classic sequential computing model, the von Neumann model, is only a vague approximation of how modern multiprocessors behave.</p>
<p class="docText1">The bottom line is that modern shared-memory multiprocessors (and compilers) can do some surprising things when data is shared across threads, unless you've told them not to through the use of memory barriers. Fortunately, Java programs need not specify the placement of memory barriers; they need only identify when shared state is being accessed, through the proper use of synchronization.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAWRYIU" class="docSection2Title">16.1.2. Reordering</h4>
<p class="docText1">In describing race conditions and atomicity failures in <a class="calibre2" href="ch02_split_000.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, we used interaction diagrams depicting "unlucky timing" where the scheduler interleaved operations so as to cause incorrect results in insufficiently synchronized programs. To make matters worse, the JMM can permit actions to appear to execute in different orders from the perspective of different threads, making reasoning about ordering in the absence of synchronization even more complicated. The various reasons why operations might be delayed or appear to execute out of order can all be grouped into the general category of <span class="docEmphasis">reordering</span>.</p>
<p class="docText1"><tt class="calibre25">PossibleReordering</tt> in <a class="calibre2" href="#ch16list01">Listing 16.1</a> illustrates how difficult it is to reason about the behavior of even the simplest concurrent programs unless they are correctly synchronized. It is fairly easy to imagine how <tt class="calibre25">PossibleReordering</tt> could print (1, 0), or (0, 1), or (1, 1): thread <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> could run to completion before <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> starts, <span class="docEmphasis">B</span> could run to completion before <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> starts, or their actions could be interleaved. But, strangely, <tt class="calibre25">PossibleReordering</tt> can also print (0, 0)! The actions in each thread have no dataflow dependence on each other, and accordingly can be executed out of order. (Even if they are executed in order, the timing by which caches are flushed to main memory can make it appear, from the perspective of <span class="docEmphasis">B</span>, that the assignments in <span class="docEmphasis">A</span> occurred in the opposite order.) <a class="calibre2" href="#ch16fig01">Figure 16.1</a> shows a possible interleaving with reordering that results in printing (0, 0).</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAU30IU" class="docSection2Title">16.1.4. Piggybacking on Synchronization</h4>
<p class="docText1">Because of the strength of the <span class="docEmphasis">happens-before</span> ordering, you can sometimes piggyback on the visibility properties of an existing synchronization. This entails combining the program order rule for <span class="docEmphasis">happens-before</span> with one of the other ordering rules (usually the monitor lock or volatile variable rule) to order accesses to a variable not otherwise guarded by a lock. This technique is very sensitive to the order in which statements occur and is therefore quite fragile; it is an advanced technique that should be reserved for squeezing the last drop of performance out of the most performance-critical classes like <tt class="calibre25">ReentrantLock</tt>.</p>
<p class="docText1">The implementation of the protected <tt class="calibre25">AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> methods in <tt class="calibre25">FutureTask</tt> illustrates piggybacking. AQS maintains an integer of synchronizer state that <tt class="calibre25">FutureTask</tt> uses to store the task state: running, completed, or <a name="iddle2190" class="calibre18" id="iddle2190"></a>cancelled. But <tt class="calibre25">FutureTask</tt> also maintains additional variables, such as the result of the computation. When one thread calls <tt class="calibre25">set</tt> to save the result and another thread calls <tt class="calibre25">get</tt> to retrieve it, the two had better be ordered by <span class="docEmphasis">happens-before</span>. This could be done by making the reference to the result <tt class="calibre25">volatile</tt>, but it is possible to exploit existing synchronization to achieve the same result at lower cost.</p>
<p class="docText1"><tt class="calibre25">FutureTask</tt> is carefully crafted to ensure that a successful call to <tt class="calibre25">tryReleaseShared</tt> always <span class="docEmphasis">happens-before</span> a subsequent call to <tt class="calibre25">TRyAcquireShared</tt>; <tt class="calibre25">try-ReleaseShared</tt> always writes to a volatile variable that is read by <tt class="calibre25">TRyAcquire-Shared</tt>. <a class="calibre2" href="#ch16list02">Listing 16.2</a> shows the <tt class="calibre25">innerSet</tt> and <tt class="calibre25">innerGet</tt> methods that are called when the result is saved or retrieved; since <tt class="calibre25">innerSet</tt> writes <tt class="calibre25">result</tt> before calling <tt class="calibre25">releaseShared</tt> (which calls <tt class="calibre25">tryReleaseShared</tt>) and <tt class="calibre25">innerGet</tt> reads <tt class="calibre25">result</tt> after calling <tt class="calibre25">acquireShared</tt> (which calls <tt class="calibre25">TRyAcquireShared</tt>), the program order rule combines with the volatile variable rule to ensure that the write of <tt class="calibre25">result</tt> in <tt class="calibre25">innerGet</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">happens-before</span> the read of <tt class="calibre25">result</tt> in <tt class="calibre25">innerGet</tt>.</p>

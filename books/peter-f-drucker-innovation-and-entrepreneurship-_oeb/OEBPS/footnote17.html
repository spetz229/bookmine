<p class="footnote" id="footnote17"> <span class="footnotePara"><a href="020-chapter13.html#footnote17" class="calibre">*</a> All these approaches have their origin in a book of mine published twenty years ago, <span class="italic">Managing for Results</span> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964), the first systematic work on business strategy, to my knowledge. This in turn grew out of the Entrepreneurship Seminar I ran in the late fifties at New York University. The analysis presented in <span class="italic">Managing for Results</span> (Chapters 1â€”5), with its ranking of all products and services into a small number of categories according to their performance, characteristics, and life expectancies, is still a useful tool for the analysis of product-life and product-health.</span></p></div>

<p class="chapterHeadA">I</p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">All experienced physicians have seen “miracle cures.” Patients suffering from terminal illnesses recover suddenly—sometimes spontaneously, sometimes by going to faith healers, by switching to some absurd diet, or by sleeping during the day and being up and about all night. Only a bigot denies that such cures happen and dismisses them as “unscientific.” They are real enough. Yet no physician is going to put miracle cures into a textbook or into a course to be taught to medical students. They cannot be replicated, cannot be taught, cannot be learned. They are also extremely rare; the overwhelming majority of terminal cases do die, after all.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, there are innovations that do not proceed from the sources described in the preceding chapters, innovations that are not developed in any organized, purposeful, systematic manner. There are innovators who are “kissed by the Muses,” and whose innovations are the result of a “flash of genius” rather than of hard, organized, purposeful work. But such innovations cannot be replicated. They cannot be taught and they cannot be learned. There is no known way to teach someone how to be a genius. But also, contrary to popular belief in the romance of invention and innovation, “flashes of genius” are uncommonly rare. What is worse, I know of not one such “flash of genius” that turned into an innovation. They all remained brilliant ideas.</p>
<p class="para">The greatest inventive genius in recorded history was surely Leonardo da Vinci. There is a breathtaking idea—submarine or helicopter or automatic forge—on every single page of his notebooks. But not one of these could have been converted into an innovation with the technology and the materials of 1500. Indeed, for none of them would there <a id="page142" class="calibre"></a>have been any receptivity in the society and economy of the time. Every schoolboy knows of James Watt as the “inventor” of the steam engine, which he was not. Historians of technology know that Thomas Newcomen in 1712 built the first steam engine which actually performed useful work: it pumped the water out of an English coal mine. Both men were organized, systematic, purposeful innovators. Watt’s steam engine in particular is the very model of an innovation in which newly available knowledge (how to ream a smooth cylinder) and the design of a “missing link” (the condenser) were combined into a process need—based innovation, the receptivity for which had been created by Newcomen’s engine (several thousand were by then in use). But the true “inventor” of the combustion engine, and with it of what we call modern technology, was neither Watt nor Newcomen. It was the great Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle, who did so in a “flash of genius.” Only Boyle’s engine did not work and could not have worked. For Boyle used the explosion of gun-power to drive the piston, and this so fouled the cylinder that it had to be taken apart and cleaned after each stroke. Boyle’s idea enabled first Denis Papin (who had been Boyle’s assistant in building the gunpowder engine), then Newcomen, and finally Watt, to develop a working combustion engine. All Boyle, the genius, had was a brilliant idea. It belongs in the history of ideas and not in the history of technology or of innovation.</p>
<p class="para">The purposeful innovation resulting from analysis, system, and hard work is all that can be discussed and presented as the practice of innovation. But this is all that need be presented since it surely covers at least 90 percent of all effective innovations. And the extraordinary performer in innovation, as in every other area, will be effective only if grounded in the discipline and master of it.</p>
<p class="para">What, then, are the principles of innovation, representing the hard core of the discipline? There are a number of “do’s”—things that have to be done. There are also a few “dont’s”—things that had better not be done. And then there are what I would call “conditions.”</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">II</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE DO</span>’<span class="smallCaps">S</span></p>
<p class="para">1. Purposeful, systematic innovation begins with the analysis of the opportunities. It begins with thinking through what I have called the sources of innovative opportunities. In different areas, different sources <a id="page143" class="calibre"></a>will have different importance at different times. Demographics, for instance, may be of very little concern to innovators in fundamental industrial processes, to someone looking, say, for the “missing link” in a process such as papermaking, where there is a clear incongruity between economic realities. New knowledge, by the same token, may be of very little relevance to someone innovating a new social instrument to satisfy a need created by changing demographics. But all the sources of innovative opportunity should be systematically analyzed and systematically studied. It is not enough to be alerted to them. The search has to be organized, and must be done on a regular, systematic basis.</p>
<p class="para">2. Innovation is both conceptual and perceptual. The second imperative of innovation is therefore to go out to look, to ask, to listen. This cannot be stressed too often. Successful innovators use both the right side and the left side of their brains. They look at figures, and they look at people. They work out analytically what the innovation has to be to satisfy an opportunity. And then they go out and look at the customers, the users, to see what their expectations, their values, their needs are.</p>
<p class="para">Receptivity can be perceived, as can values. One can perceive that this or that approach will not fit in with the expectations or the habits of the people who have to use it. And then one can ask: “What does this innovation have to reflect so that the people who have to use it will <span class="italic">want</span> to use it, and see in it <span class="italic">their</span> opportunity?” Otherwise one runs the risk of having the right innovation in the wrong form—as happened to the leading producer of computer programs for learning in American schools, whose excellent and effective programs were not used by teachers scared stiff of the computer, who perceived the machine as something that, far from being helpful, threatened them.</p>
<p class="para">3. An innovation, to be effective, has to be simple and it has to be focused. It should do only one thing, otherwise, it confuses. If it is not simple, it won’t work. Everything new runs into trouble; if complicated, it cannot be repaired or fixed. All effective innovations are breathtakingly simple. Indeed, the greatest praise an innovation can receive is for people to say: “This is obvious. Why didn’t I think of it?”</p>
<p class="para">Even the innovation that creates new uses and new markets should be directed toward a specific, clear, designed application. It should be focused on a specific need that it satisfies, on a specific end result that it produces.</p>
<p class="para">4. Effective innovations start small. They are not grandiose. They try to do one specific thing. It may be to enable a moving vehicle to draw electric power while it runs along rails—the innovation that made possi<a id="page144" class="calibre"></a>ble the electric streetcar. Or it may be as elementary as putting the same number of matches into a matchbox (it used to be fifty), which made possible the automatic filling of matchboxes and gave the Swedish originators of the idea a world monopoly on matches for almost half a century. Grandiose ideas, plans that aim at “revolutionizing an industry,” are unlikely to work.</p>
<p class="para">Innovations had better be capable of being started small, requiring at first little money, few people, and only a small and limited market. Otherwise, there is not enough time to make the adjustments and changes that are almost always needed for an innovation to succeed. Initially innovations rarely are more than “almost right.” The necessary changes can be made only if the scale is small and the requirements for people and money fairly modest.</p>
<p class="para">5. But—and this is the final “do”—a successful innovation aims at leadership. It does not aim necessarily at becoming eventually a “big business” in fact, no one can foretell whether a given innovation will end up as a big business or a modest achievement. But if an innovation does not aim at leadership from the beginning, it is unlikely to be innovative enough, and therefore unlikely to be capable of establishing itself. Strategies (to be discussed in Chapters 16 through 19) vary greatly, from those that aim at dominance in an industry or a market to those that aim at finding and occupying a small “ecological niche” in a process or market. But all entrepreneurial strategies, that is, all strategies aimed at exploiting an innovation, must achieve leadership within a given environment. Otherwise they will simply create an opportunity for the competition.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">III</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">THE DONT’S</span></p>
<p class="para">And now the few important “dont’s.” 1. The first is simply not to try to be clever. Innovations have to be handled by ordinary human beings, and if they are to attain any size and importance at all, by morons or near-morons. Incompetence, after all, is the only thing in abundant and never-failing supply. Anything too clever, whether in design or execution, is almost bound to fail.</p>
<p class="para">2. Don’t diversify, don’t splinter, don’t try to do too many things at once. This is, of course, the corollary to the “do”: be focused! Innova<a id="page145" class="calibre"></a>tions that stray from a core are likely to become diffuse. They remain ideas and do not become innovations. The core does not have to be technology or knowledge. In fact, market knowledge supplies a better core of unity in any enterprise, whether business or public-service institution, than knowledge or technology do. But there has to be a core of unity to innovative efforts or they are likely to fly apart. An innovation needs the concentrated energy of a unified effort behind it. It also requires that the people who put it into effect understand each other, and this, too, requires a unity, a common core. This, too, is imperiled by diversity and splintering.</p>
<p class="para">3. Finally, don’t try to innovate for the future. Innovate for the present! An innovation may have long-range impact; it may not reach its full maturity until twenty years later. The computer, as we have seen, did not really begin to have any sizable impact on the way business was being done until the early 1970s, twenty-five years after the first working models were introduced. But from the first day the computer had some specific current applications, whether scientific calculation, making payroll, or simulation to train pilots to fly airplanes. It is not good enough to be able to say, “In twenty-five years there will be so many very old people that they will need this.” One has to be able to say, “There are enough old people around today for this to make a difference to them. Of course, time is with us—in twenty-five years there will be many more.” But unless there is an immediate application in the present, an innovation is like the drawings in Leonardo da Vinci’s notebook—a “brilliant idea.” Very few of us have Leonardo’s genius and can expect that our notebooks alone will assure immortality.</p>
<p class="para">The first innovator who fully understood this third caveat was probably Edison. Every other electrical inventor of the time began to work around 1860 or 1865 on what eventually became the light bulb. Edison waited for ten years until the knowledge became available; up to that point, work on the light bulb was “of the future.” But when the knowledge became available—when, in other words, a light bulb could become “the present”—Edison organized his tremendous energies and an extraordinarily capable staff and concentrated for a couple of years on that one innovative opportunity.</p>
<p class="para">Innovative opportunities sometimes have long lead times. In pharmaceutical research, ten years of research and development work are by no means uncommon or particularly long. And yet no pharmaceu<a id="page146" class="calibre"></a>tical company would dream of starting a research project for something which does not, if successful, have immediate application as a drug for health-care needs that already exist.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB1"><span class="smallCaps">THREE CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p class="para">Finally, there are three conditions. All three are obvious but often go disregarded.</p>
<p class="para">1. <span class="italic">Innovation is work.</span> It requires knowledge. It often requires great ingenuity. There are clearly people who are more talented innovators than the rest of us. Also, innovators rarely work in more than one area. For all his tremendous innovative capacity, Edison worked only in the electrical field. And an innovator in financial areas, Citibank in New York, for instance, is unlikely to embark on innovations in retailing or health care. In innovation as in any other work there is talent, there is ingenuity, there is predisposition. But when all is said and done, innovation becomes hard, focused, purposeful work making very great demands on diligence, on persistence, and on commitment. If these are lacking, no amount of talent, ingenuity, or knowledge will avail.</p>
<p class="para">2. <span class="italic">To succeed, innovators must build on their strengths.</span> Successful innovators look at opportunities over a wide range. But then they ask, “Which of these opportunities fits <span class="italic">me,</span> fits <span class="italic">this</span> company, puts to work what we (or I) are good at and have shown capacity for in performance?” In this respect, of course, innovation is no different from other work. But it may be more important in innovation to build on one’s strengths because of the risks of innovation and the resulting premium on knowledge and performance capacity. And in innovation, as in any other venture, there must also be a temperamental “fit.” Businesses do not do well in something they do not really respect. No pharmaceutical company—run as it has to be by scientifically minded people who see themselves as “serious”—has done well in anything so “frivolous” as lipsticks or perfumes. Innovators similarly need to be temperamentally attuned to the innovative opportunity. It must be important to them and make sense to them. Otherwise they will not be willing to put in the persistent, hard, frustrating work that successful innovation always requires.</p>
<p class="para">3. And finally, <span class="italic">innovation is an effect in economy and society, a</span> change in the behavior of customers, of teachers, of farmers, of eye surgeons—of people in general. Or it is a change in a process—that <a id="page147" class="calibre"></a>is, in how people work and produce something. Innovation therefore always has to be close to the market, focused on the market, indeed market-driven.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB1"><span class="smallCaps">THE CONSERVATIVE INNOVATOR</span></p>
<p class="para">A year or two ago I attended a university symposium on entrepreneurship at which a number of psychologists spoke. Although their papers disagreed on everything else, they all talked of an “entrepreneurial personality,” which was characterized by a “propensity for risk-taking.”</p>
<p class="para">A well-known and successful innovator and entrepreneur who had built a process-based innovation into a substantial worldwide business in the space of twenty-five years was then asked to comment. He said: “I find myself baffled by your papers. I think I know as many successful innovators and entrepreneurs as anyone, beginning with myself. I have never come across an ‘entrepreneurial personality.’ The successful ones I know all have, however, one thing—and only one thing—in common: they are <span class="italic">not</span> ‘risk-takers.’ They try to define the risks they have to take and to minimize them as much as possible. Otherwise none of us could have succeeded. As for myself, if I had wanted to be a risk-taker, I would have gone into real estate or commodity trading, or I would have become the professional painter my mother wanted me to be.”</p>
<p class="para">This jibes with my own experience. I, too, know a good many successful innovators and entrepreneurs. Not one of them has a “propensity for risk-taking.”</p>
<p class="para">The popular picture of innovators—half pop-psychology, half Hollywood—makes them look like a cross between Superman and the Knights of the Round Table. Alas, most of them in real life are unromantic figures, and much more likely to spend hours on a cash-flow projection than to dash off looking for “risks.” Of course innovation is risky. But so is stepping into the car to drive to the supermarket for a loaf of bread. All economic activity is by definition “high-risk.” And defending yesterday—that is, not innovating—is far more risky than making tomorrow. The innovators I know are successful to the extent to which they define risks and confine them. They are successful to the extent to which they systematically analyze the sources of innovative opportunity, then pinpoint the opportunity and exploit it. Whether opportuni<a id="page148" class="calibre"></a>ties of small and clearly definable risk, such as exploiting the unexpected or a process need, or opportunities of much greater but still definable risk, as in knowledge-based innovation.</p>
<p class="para">Successful innovators are conservative. They have to be. They are not “risk-focused” they are “opportunity-focused.”</p>

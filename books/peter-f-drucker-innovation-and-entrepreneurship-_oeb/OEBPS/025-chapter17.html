<div class="contents">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Two completely different entrepreneurial strategies were summed up by another battle-winning Confederate general in America’s Civil War, who said: “Hit Them Where They Ain’t.” They might be called creative imitation and entrepreneurial judo, respectively.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">I</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">CREATIVE IMITATION</span></p>
<p class="para">Creative imitation<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote29.html" id="footnote29" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> is clearly a contradiction in terms. What is creative must surely be original. And if there is one thing imitation is not, it <span class="italic">is</span> “original.” Yet the term fits. It describes a strategy that is “imitation” in its substance. What the entrepreneur does is something somebody else has already done. But it is “creative” because the entrepreneur applying the strategy of “creative imitation” understands what the innovation represents better than the people who made it and who innovated.</p>
<p class="para">The foremost practitioner of this strategy and the most brilliant one is IBM. But it is also very largely the strategy that Procter &amp; Gamble has been using to obtain and maintain leadership in the soap, detergent, and toiletries markets. And the Japanese Hattori Company, whose Seiko watches have become the world’s leader, also owes its domination of the market to creative imitation.</p>
<p class="para">In the early thirties IBM built a high-speed calculating machine to do calculations for the astronomers at New York’s Columbia University. A few years later it built a machine that was already designed as a computer—again, to do astronomical calculations, this time at Harvard. And by the end of World War II, IBM had built a real computer<a id="page229" class="calibre"></a>—the first one, by the way, that had the features of the true computer: a “memory” and the capacity to be “programmed.” And yet there are good reasons why the history books pay scant attention to IBM as a computer innovator. For as soon as it had finished its advanced 1945 computer—the first computer to be shown to a lay public in its showroom in midtown New York, where it drew immense crowds—IBM abandoned its own design and switched to the design of its rival, the ENIAC developed at the University of Pennsylvania. The ENIAC was far better suited to business applications such as payroll, only its designers did not see this. IBM structured the ENIAC so that it could be manufactured and serviced and could do mundane “numbers crunching.” When IBM’s version of the ENIAC came out in 1953, it at once set the standard for commercial, multipurpose, mainframe computers.</p>
<p class="para">This is the strategy of “creative imitation.” It waits until somebody else has established the new, but only “approximately.” Then it goes to work. And within a short time it comes out with what the new really should be to satisfy the customer, to do the work customers want and pay for. The creative imitation has then set the standard and takes over the market.</p>
<p class="para">IBM practiced creative imitation again with the personal computer. The idea was Apple’s. As described earlier (in Chapter 3), everybody at IBM “knew” that a small, freestanding computer was a mistake—uneconomical, far from optimal, and expensive. And yet it succeeded. IBM immediately went to work to design a machine that would become the standard in the personal computer field and dominate or at least lead the entire field. The result was the PC. Within two years it had taken over from Apple leadership in the personal computer field, becoming the fastest-selling brand and the standard in the field.</p>
<p class="para">Procter &amp; Gamble acts very much the same way in the market for detergents, soaps, toiletries, and processed foods.</p>
<p class="para">When semiconductors became available, everyone in the watch industry knew that they could be used to power a watch much more accurately, much more reliably, and much more cheaply than traditional watch movements. The Swiss soon brought out a quartz-powered digital watch. But they had so much investment in traditional watchmaking that they decided on a gradual introduction of quartz-powered digital watches over a long period of time, during which these new timepieces would remain expensive luxuries.</p>
<a id="page230" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Meanwhile, the Hattori Company in Japan had long been making conventional watches for the Japanese market. It saw the opportunity and went in for creative imitation, developing the quartz-powered digital watch as the standard timepiece. By the time the Swiss had woken up, it was too late. Seiko watches had become the world’s bestsellers, with the Swiss almost pushed out of the market.</p>
<p class="para">Like being “Fustest with the Mostest,” creative imitation is a strategy aimed at market or industry leadership, if not at market or industry dominance. But it is much less risky. By the time the creative imitator moves, the market has been established and the new venture has been accepted. Indeed, there is usually more demand for it than the original innovator can easily supply. The market segmentations are known or at least knowable. By then, too, market research can find out what customers buy, how they buy, what constitutes value for them, and so on. Most of the uncertainties that abound when the first innovator appears have been dispelled or can at least be analyzed and studied. No one has to explain any more what a personal computer or a digital watch are and what they can do.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, the original innovator may do it right the first time, thus closing the door to creative imitation. There is the risk of an innovator bringing out and doing the right job with vitamins as Hoffmann-LaRoche did, or with Nylon as did DuPont, or as Wang did with the word processor. But the number of entrepreneurs engaging in creative imitation, and their substantial success, indicates that perhaps the risk of the first innovator’s preempting the market by getting it right is not an overwhelming one.</p>
<p class="para">Another good example of creative imitation is Tylenol, the “non-aspirin aspirin.” This case shows more clearly than any other I know what the strategy consists of, what its requirements are, and how it works.</p>
<p class="para">Acetaminophen (the substance that is sold under the Tylenol brand name in the U.S.) had been used for many years as a painkiller, but until recently it was available in the United States only by prescription. Until recently also, aspirin, the much older pain-killing substance, was considered perfectly safe and had the pain-relief market to itself. Acetaminophen is a less potent drug than aspirin. It is effective as a painkiller but has no anti-inflammatory effect and also no effect on blood coagulation. Because of this it is free from the side effects, especially gastric upsets and stomach bleeding, which aspirin can cause, particularly if used in <a id="page231" class="calibre"></a>large doses and over long periods of time for an illness like arthritis.</p>
<p class="para">When acetaminophen became available without prescription, the first brand on the market was presented and promoted as a drug for those who suffered side effects from aspirin. It was eminently successful, indeed, far more successful than its makers had anticipated. But it was this very success that created the opportunity for creative imitation. Johnson &amp; Johnson realized that there was a market for a drug that <span class="italic">replaced</span> aspirin as the painkiller of choice, with aspirin confined to the fairly small market where anti-inflammatory and blood coagulation effects were needed. From the start Tylenol was promoted as the safe, <span class="italic">universal</span> painkiller. Within a year or two it had the market.</p>
<p class="para">Creative imitation, these cases show, does not exploit the failure of the pioneers as failure is commonly understood. On the contrary, the pioneer must be successful. The Apple computer was a great success story, and so was the acetaminophen brand that Tylenol ultimately pushed out of market leadership. But the original innovators failed to understand their success. The makers of the Apple were product-focused rather than user-focused, and therefore offered additional hardware where the user needed programs and software. In the Tylenol case, the original innovators failed to realize what their own success meant.</p>
<p class="para">The creative innovator exploits the success of others. Creative imitation is not “innovation” in the sense in which the term is most commonly understood. The creative imitator does not invent a product or service; he perfects and positions it. In the form in which it has been introduced, it lacks something. It may be additional product features. It may be segmentation of product or services so that slightly different versions fit slightly different markets. It might be proper positioning of the product in the market. Or creative imitation supplies something that is still lacking.</p>
<p class="para">The creative imitator looks at products or services from the viewpoint of the customer. IBM’s personal computer is practically indistinguishable from the Apple in its technical features, but IBM from the beginning offered the customer programs and software. Apple maintained traditional computer distribution through specialty stores. IBM—in a radical break with its own traditions—developed all kinds of distribution channels, specialty stores, major retailers like Sears, Roebuck, its own retail stores, and so on. It made it easy for the consumer to buy and it made it easy for the consumer to use the product. These, <a id="page232" class="calibre"></a>rather than hardware features, were the “innovations” that gave IBM the personal computer market.</p>
<p class="para">All told, creative imitation starts out with markets rather than with products, and with customers rather than with producers. It is both market-focused and market-driven.</p>
<p class="para">These cases show what the strategy of creative imitation requires:</p>
<p class="para">It requires a rapidly growing market. Creative imitators do not succeed by taking away customers from the pioneers who have first introduced a new product or service; they serve markets the pioneers have created but do not adequately service. Creative imitation satisfies <span class="italic">a</span> demand that already exists rather than creating one.</p>
<p class="para">The strategy has its own risks, and they are considerable. Creative imitators are easily tempted to splinter their efforts in the attempt to hedge their bets. Another danger is to misread the trend and imitate creatively what then turns out not to be the winning development in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="para">IBM, the world’s foremost creative imitator, exemplifies these dangers. It has successfully imitated every major development in the office-automation field. As a result, <span class="italic">it</span> has the leading product in every single area. But because they originated in imitation, the products are so diverse and so little compatible with one another that it is all but impossible to build an integrated, automated office out of IBM building blocks. It is thus still doubtful that IBM can maintain leadership in the automated office and provide the integrated system for it. Yet this is where the main market of the future is going to be in all probability. And this risk, <span class="italic">the risk of being too clever,</span> is inherent in the creative imitation strategy.</p>
<p class="para">Creative imitation is likely to work most effectively in high-tech areas for one simple reason: high-tech innovators are least likely to be market-focused, and most likely to be technology-and product-focused. They therefore tend to misunderstand their own success and to fail to exploit and supply the demand they have created. But as acetaminophen and the Seiko watch show, they are by no means the only ones to do so.</p>
<p class="para">Because creative imitation aims at market dominance, it is best suited to a major product, process, or service: the personal computer, the worldwide watch market, or a market as large as that for pain relief. But the strategy requires less of a market than being “Fustest with the Mostest.” It carries less risk. By the time creative imitators go to work, <a id="page233" class="calibre"></a>the market has already been identified and the demand has already been created. What it lacks in risk, however, creative imitation makes up for in its requirements for alertness, for flexibility, for willingness to accept the verdict of the market, and above all, for hard work and massive efforts.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">II</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">ENTREPRENEURIAL JUDO</span></p>
<p class="para">In 1947, Bell Laboratories invented the transistor. It was at once realized that the transistor was going to replace the vacuum tube, especially in consumer electronics such as the radio and the brand-new television set. Everybody knew this; but nobody did anything about it. The leading manufacturers—at that time they were all Americans—began to study the transistor and to make plans for conversion to the transistor “sometime around 1970.” Till then, they proclaimed, the transistor “would not be ready.” Sony was practically unknown outside of Japan and was not even in consumer electronics at the time. But Akio Morita, Sony’s president, read about the transistor in the newspapers. As a result, he went to the United States and bought a license for the new transistor from Bell Labs for a ridiculous sum, all of $25,000. Two years later, Sony brought out the first portable transistor radio, which weighed less than one-fifth of comparable vacuum tube radios on the market, and cost less than one-third. Three years later, Sony had the market for cheap radios in the United States; and live years later, the Japanese had captured the radio market all over the world.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, this is a classic case of the rejection of the unexpected success. The Americans rejected the transistor because it was “not invented here,” that is, not invented by the electrical and electronic leaders, RCA and G.E. It is a typical example of pride in doing things the hard way. The Americans were so proud of the wonderful radios of those days, the great Super Heterodyne sets that were such marvels of craftsmanship. Compared to them, they thought silicon chips low grade, if not indeed beneath their dignity.</p>
<p class="para">But Sony’s success is not the real story. How do we explain that the Japanese repeated this same strategy again and again, and always with success, always surprising the Americans? They repeated it with television sets and digital watches and hand-held calculators. They repeated <a id="page234" class="calibre"></a>it with copiers when they moved in and took away a large share of the market from the original inventor, the Xerox Company. The Japanese, in other words, have been successful again and again in practicing “entrepreneurial judo” against the Americans.</p>
<p class="para">But so did MCI and Sprint when they used the Bell Telephone System’s (AT&amp;T) own pricing to take away from the Bell System a very large part of the long-distance business (see Chapter 6). So did ROLM when it used Bell System’s policies against it to take away a large part of the private branch exchange (PBX) market. And so did Citibank when it started a consumer bank in Germany, the <span class="italic">“Familienbank”</span> (Family Bank), which within a few short years came to dominate German consumer finance.</p>
<p class="para">The German banks knew that ordinary consumers had obtained purchasing power and had become desirable clients. They went through the motions of offering consumers banking services. But they really did not want them. Consumers, they felt, were beneath the dignity of a major bank, with its business customers and its rich investment clients. If consumers needed an account at all, they should have it with the postal savings bank. Whatever their advertisements said to the contrary, the banks made it abundantly clear when consumers came into the august offices of the local branch that they had little use for them.</p>
<p class="para">This was the opening Citibank exploited when it founded its German <span class="italic">Familienbank,</span> which catered to none but individual consumers, designed the services consumers needed, and made it easy for consumers to do business with a bank. Despite the tremendous strength of the German banks and their pervasive presence in a country where there is a branch of a major bank on the corner of every downtown street, Citibank’s <span class="italic">Familienbank</span> attained dominance in the German consumer banking business within five years or so.</p>
<p class="para">All these newcomers—the Japanese, MCI, ROLM, Citibank—practiced “entrepreneurial judo.” Of the entrepreneurial strategies, especially the strategies aimed at obtaining leadership and dominance in an industry or a market, entrepreneurial judo is by all odds the least risky and the most likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="para">Every policeman knows that a habitual criminal will always commit his crime the same way—whether it is cracking a safe or entering a building he wants to loot. He leaves behind a “signature,” which is as individual and as distinct as a fingerprint. And he will not change that <a id="page235" class="calibre"></a>signature even though it leads to his being caught time and again.</p>
<p class="para">But it is not only the criminal who is set in his habits. All of us are.</p>
<p class="para">And so are businesses and industries. The habit will be persisted in even though it leads again and again to loss of leadership and loss of market. The American manufacturers persisted in the habits that enabled the Japanese to take over their market again and again.</p>
<p class="para">If the criminal is caught, he rarely accepts that his habit has betrayed him. On the contrary, he will find all kinds of excuses—and continue the habit that led to his being captured. Similarly, businesses that are being betrayed by their habits will not admit it and will find all kinds of excuses. The American electronics manufacturers, for instance, attribute the Japanese successes to “low labor costs” in Japan. Yet the few American manufacturers that have faced up to reality, for example, RCA and Magnavox in television sets, are able to turn out in the United States products at prices competitive with those of the Japanese, and competitive also in quality, despite their paying American wages and union benefits. The German banks uniformly explain the success of Citibank’s <span class="italic">Familienbank</span> by its taking risks they themselves would not touch. But <span class="italic">Familienbank</span> has lower credit losses with consumer loans than the German banks, and its lending requirements are as strict as those of the Germans. The German banks know this, of course. Yet they keep on explaining away their failure and <span class="italic">Familienbank</span> ‘s success. This is typical. And it explains why the same strategy—the same entrepreneurial judo—can be used over and over again.</p>
<p class="para">There are in particular five fairly common bad habits that enable newcomers to use entrepreneurial judo and to catapult themselves into a leadership position in an industry against the entrenched, established companies.</p>
<p class="para">1. The first is what American slang calls “NIH” (“Not Invented Here”), the arrogance that leads a company or an industry to believe that something new cannot be any good unless they themselves thought of it. And so the new invention is spurned, as was the transistor by the American electronics manufacturers.</p>
<p class="para">2. The second is the tendency to “cream” a market, that is, to get the high-profit part of it.</p>
<p class="para">This is basically what Xerox did and what made it an easy target for the Japanese imitators of its copying machines. Xerox focused its strategy on the big users, the buyers of large numbers of machines or of expensive, high-performance machines. It did not reject the others; but <a id="page236" class="calibre"></a>it did not go after them. In particular, it did not see fit to give them service. In the end it was dissatisfaction with the service—or rather, with the lack of service—Xerox provided for its smaller customers that made them receptive to competitors’ machines.</p>
<p class="para">“Creaming” is a violation of elementary managerial and economic precepts. It is always punished by loss of market.</p>
<p class="para">Xerox was resting on its laurels. They were indeed substantial and well earned, but no business ever gets paid for what it did in the past. “Creaming” attempts to get paid for past contributions. Once a business gets into that habit, it is likely to continue in it and thus continue to be vulnerable to entrepreneurial judo.</p>
<p class="para">3. Even more debilitating is the third bad habit: the belief in “quality.” “Quality” in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for. A product is not “quality” because it is hard to make and costs a lot of money, as manufacturers typically believe. That is incompetence. Customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value. Nothing else constitutes “quality.”</p>
<p class="para">The American electronics manufacturers in the 1950s believed that their products with all those wonderful vacuum tubes were “quality” because they had put in thirty years of effort making radio sets more complicated, bigger, and more expensive. They considered the product to be “quality” because it needed a great deal of skill to turn out, whereas a transistor radio is simple and can be made by unskilled labor on the assembly line. But in consumer terms, the transistor radio is clearly far superior “quality.” It weighs much less so that it can be taken on a trip to the beach or to a picnic. It rarely goes wrong; there are no tubes to replace. It costs a great deal less. And in range and fidelity it very soon surpassed even the most magnificent Super Heterodyne with sixteen vacuum tubes, one of which always burned out just when needed.</p>
<p class="para">4. Closely related to both “creaming” and “quality” is the fourth bad habit, the delusion of the “premium” price. A “premium” price is always an invitation to the competitor.</p>
<p class="para">For two hundred years, since the time of J. B. Say in France and of David Ricardo in England in the early years of the nineteenth century, economists have known that the only way to get a higher profit margin, except through a monopoly, is through lower costs. The attempt to achieve a higher profit margin through a higher price is always self-<a id="page237" class="calibre"></a>defeating. It holds an umbrella over the competitor. What looks like higher profits for the established leader is in effect a subsidy to the newcomer who, in a very few years, will unseat the leader and claim the throne for himself. “Premium” prices, instead of being an occasion for joy—and a reason for a higher stock price or a higher price/earnings multiple—should always be considered a threat and dangerous vulnerability.</p>
<p class="para">Yet the delusion of higher profits to be achieved through “premium” prices is almost universal, even though it always opens the door to entrepreneurial judo.</p>
<p class="para">5. Finally, there is a fifth bad habit that is typical of established businesses and leads to their downfall—Xerox is a good example. They maximize rather than optimize. As the market grows and develops, they try to satisfy every single user through the same product or service.</p>
<p class="para">A new analytical instrument to test chemical reaction is being introduced, for instance. At first its market is quite limited, let’s say to industrial laboratories. But then university laboratories, research institutes, and hospitals all begin to buy the instrument, but each wants something slightly different. And so the manufacturer puts in one feature to satisfy this customer, then another one to satisfy that customer, and so on, until what started out as a simple instrument has become complicated. The manufacturer has maximized what the instrument can do. As a result, the instrument no longer satisfies anyone. For, by trying to satisfy everybody, one always ends up satisfying nobody. The instrument also has become expensive, as well as being hard to use and hard to maintain. But the manufacturer is proud of the instrument; indeed, his full-page advertisement lists sixty-four different things it can do.</p>
<p class="para">This manufacturer will almost certainly become the victim of entrepreneurial judo. What he thinks is his very strength will be turned against him. The newcomer will come in with an instrument designed to satisfy one of the markets, the hospital, for instance. It will not contain a single feature the hospital people do not need, and do not need every day. But everything the hospital needs will be there and with higher performance capacity than the multipurpose instrument can possibly offer. The same manufacturer will then bring out a model for the research laboratory, for the government laboratory, for industry—and in no time at all the newcomer will have taken away the markets with instruments that are specifically designed for their users, instruments that optimize rather than maximize.</p>
<a id="page238" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Similarly, when the Japanese came in with their copiers in competition with Xerox, they designed machines that fitted specific groups of users—for example, the small office, whether that of the dentist, the doctor, or the school principal. They did not try to match the features of which the Xerox people themselves were the proudest, such as the speed of the machine or the clarity of the copy. They gave the small office what the small office needed most, a simple machine at a low cost. And once they had established themselves in that market, they then moved in on the other markets, each with a product designed to serve optimally a specific market segment.</p>
<p class="para">Sony similarly first moved into the low end of the radio market, the market for cheap portables with limited range. Once it had established itself there, it moved in on the other market segments.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="para">Entrepreneurial judo aims first at securing a beachhead, and one which the established leaders either do not defend at all or defend only halfheartedly—the way the Germans did not counterattack when Citibank established its <span class="italic">Familienbank.</span> Once that beachhead has been secured, that is, once the newcomers have an adequate market and an adequate revenue stream, they then move on to the rest of the “beach” and finally to the whole “island.” In each case, they repeat the strategy. They design a product or a service which is specific to a given market segment and optimal for it. And the established leaders hardly ever beat them to this game. Hardly ever do the established leaders manage to change their own behavior before the newcomers have taken over the leadership and acquired dominance.</p>
<p class="para">There are three situations in which the entrepreneurial judo strategy is likely to be particularly successful.</p>
<p class="para">The first is the common situation in which the established leaders refuse to act on the unexpected, whether success or failure, and either overlook it altogether or try to brush it aside. This is what Sony exploited.</p>
<p class="para">The second situation is the Xerox situation. A new technology emerges and grows fast. But the innovators who have brought to the market the new technology (or the new service) behave like the classical “monopolists”: they use their leadership position to “cream” the market and to get “premium” prices. They either do not know or refuse to acknowledge what has been amply proven: that a leadership position, let alone any kind of monopoly, can only be maintained if the <a id="page239" class="calibre"></a>leader behaves as a “benevolent monopolist” (the term is Joseph Schumpeter’s).</p>
<p class="para">A benevolent monopolist cuts his prices before a competitor can cut them. And he makes his product obsolete and introduces new product before a competitor can do so. There are enough examples of this around to prove the validity of the thesis. It is the way in which the DuPont Company has acted for many years and in which the American Bell Telephone System (AT&amp;T) used to act before it was overcome by the inflationary problems of the 1970s. But if the leader uses his leadership position to raise prices or to raise profit margins except by lowering his cost, he sets himself up to be knocked down by anyone who uses entrepreneurial judo against him.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, the leader in a rapidly growing new market or new technology who tries to maximize rather than to optimize will soon make himself vulnerable to entrepreneurial judo.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, entrepreneurial judo works as a strategy when market or industry structure changes fast—which is the <span class="italic">Familienbank</span> story. As Germany became prosperous in the fifties and sixties, ordinary people became customers for financial services beyond the traditional savings account or the traditional mortgage. But the German banks stuck to their old markets.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="para">Entrepreneurial judo is always market-focused and market-driven. The starting point may be technology, as it was when Akio Morita traveled to the United States from a Japan that had barely emerged from the destruction of World War II to acquire a transistor license. Morita looked at the market segment which the existing technology satisfied the least, simply because of the weight and fragility of vacuum tubes: the market for portables. He then designed the right radio for that market, a market of young people with little money but also fairly simple demands with respect to range of the instrument and to quality of sound, a market, in other words, that the old technology simply could not adequately serve.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, the long-distance discounters in the United States who saw the opportunity to buy from the Bell Telephone System wholesale and to resell retail, designed a service first for the fairly modest number of substantial businesses that were too small to build their own longdistance system but large enough to have heavy long-distance bills. Only after they had secured a substantial share of that <a id="page240" class="calibre"></a>market did they move out and try to go after both the very big and the small users.</p>
<p class="para">To use the entrepreneurial judo strategy, one starts out with an analysis of the industry, the producers and the suppliers, their habits, especially their bad habits, and their policies. But then one looks at the markets and tries to pinpoint the place where an alternative strategy would meet with the greatest success and the least resistance.</p>
<p class="para">Entrepreneurial judo requires some degree of genuine innovation. It is, as a rule, not good enough to offer the same product or the same service at lower cost. There has to be something that distinguishes <span class="italic">it</span> from what already exists. When the ROLM Company offered a private branch exchange—a switchboard for business and office users—in competition with AT&amp;T, it built in additional features designed around a small computer. These were not high-tech, let alone new inventions. Indeed, AT&amp;T itself had designed similar features. But AT&amp;T did not push them—and ROLM did. Similarly, when Citibank went into Germany with the <span class="italic">Familienbank,</span> it put in some innovative services which German banks as a rule did not offer to small depositors, such as travelers checks or tax advice.</p>
<p class="para">It is not enough, in other words, for the newcomer simply to do as good a job as the established leader at a lower cost or with better service. The newcomers have to make themselves distinct.</p>
<p class="para">Like being “Fustest with the Mostest” and creative imitation, entrepreneurial judo aims at obtaining leadership position and eventually dominance. But it does not do so by competing with the leaders—or at least not where the leaders are aware of competitive challenge or worried about it. Entrepreneurial judo “Hits Them Where They Ain’t.”</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote25"> <span class="footnotePara"><a href="024-chapter16.html#footnote25" class="calibre">*</a> The 1952 edition of the <span class="italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary</span> still defined strategy as: “Generalship; the art of war; management of an army or armies in a campaign.” Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., first applied the term to the conduct of a business in 1962 in his pioneering <span class="italic">Strategy and Structure</span> (Cambridge, Mass.: M.I.T. Press), which studied the evolution of management in the big corporation. But shortly thereafter, in 1963, when I wrote the first analysis of business strategy, the publisher and I found that the word could not be used in the title without risk of serious misunderstanding. Booksellers, magazine editors, and senior business executives all assured us that “strategy” for them meant the conduct of military or election campaigns. The book discussed most that is now considered “strategy.” It uses the word in the text. But the title we chose was <span class="italic">Managing for Results.</span></span></p></div>

<p class="chapterOpenerText">Of late, “strategy in business”<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote25.html" id="footnote25" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> has become the “in” word, with any number of books written about it.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote26.html" id="footnote26" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">†</sup></a></span> However, I have not come across any discussion of entrepreneurial strategies. Yet they are important; they are distinct; and they are different.</p>
<p class="para">There are four specifically entrepreneurial strategies:</p>
<p class="colophon"> </p>
<p class="para">1. Being “Fustest with the Mostest”</p>
<p class="para">2. “Hitting Them Where They Ain’t”</p>
<p class="para">3. Finding and occupying a specialized “ecological niche”</p>
<p class="para">4. Changing the economic characteristics of a product, a market, or an industry.</p>
<p class="colophon"> </p>
<p class="para">These four strategies are not mutually exclusive. One and the same entrepreneur often combines two, sometimes even elements of three, in one strategy. They are also not always sharply differentiated; the same strategy might, for instance, be classified as “Hitting Them Where They Ain’t” or as “Finding and occupying a specialized ‘ecological niche.’” Still, each of these four has its prerequisites. Each fits certain kinds of innovation and does not fit others. Each requires specific behavior on the part of the entrepreneur. Finally, each has its own limitations and carries its own risks.</p>
<a id="page218" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="chapterHeadA">I</p>
<p class="colophon"> </p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="smallCaps">BEING “FUSTEST WITH THE MOSTEST</span>”</p>
<p class="para">Being “Fustest with the Mostest” was how a Confederate cavalry general in America’s Civil War explained consistently winning his battles. In this strategy the entrepreneur aims at leadership, if not at dominance of a new market or a new industry. Being “Fustest with the Mostest” does not necessarily aim at creating a big business right away, though often this is indeed the aim. But it aims from the start at a permanent leadership position.</p>
<p class="para">Being “Fustest with the Mostest” is the approach that many people consider the entrepreneurial strategy <span class="italic">par excellence.</span> Indeed, <span class="italic">if</span> one were to go by the popular books on entrepreneurs,<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote27.html" id="footnote27" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> one would conclude that being “Fustest with the Mostest” is the only entrepreneurial strategy—and a good many entrepreneurs, especially the high-tech ones, seem to be of the same opinion.</p>
<p class="para">They are wrong, however. To be sure, a good many entrepreneurs have indeed chosen this strategy. Yet being “Fustest with the Mostest” is not even the dominant entrepreneurial strategy, let alone the one with the lowest risk or the highest success ratio. On the contrary, of all entrepreneurial strategies it is the greatest gamble. And it is unforgiving, making no allowances for mistakes and permitting no second chance.</p>
<p class="para">But if successful, being “Fustest with the Mostest” is highly rewarding.</p>
<p class="para">Here are some examples to show what this strategy consists of and what it requires.</p>
<p class="para">Hoffmann-LaRoche of Basel, Switzerland, has for many years been the world’s largest and in all probability its most profitable pharmaceutical company. But its origins were quite humble: until the mid1920s, Hoffmann-LaRoche was a small and struggling manufacturing chemist, making a few textile dyes. It was totally overshadowed by the huge German dye-stuff makers and two or three much bigger chemical firms in its own country. Then it gambled on the newly discovered vitamins at a time when the scientific world still could not quite accept <a id="page219" class="calibre"></a>that such substances existed. It acquired the vitamin patents—nobody else wanted them. It hired the discoverers away from Zurich University at several times the salaries they could hope to get as professors, salaries even industry had never paid before. And it invested all the money it had and all <span class="italic">it</span> could borrow in manufacturing and marketing these new substances.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Sixty</span> years later, long after all vitamin patents have expired, Hoffmann-LaRoche has nearly half the world’s vitamin market, now amounting to billions of dollars a year. The company followed the same strategy twice more: in the 1930s, when it went into the new sulfa drugs even though most scientists of the time “knew” that systemic drugs could not be effective against infections; and twenty years later, in the mid-fifties, when it went into the muscle-relaxing tranquilizers, Librium and Valium—at that time considered equally heretical and incompatible with what “every scientist knew.”</p>
<p class="para">DuPont followed the same strategy. When it came up with Nylon, the first truly synthetic fiber, after fifteen years of hard, frustrating research, DuPont at once mounted massive efforts, built huge plants, went into mass advertising—the company had never before had consumer products to advertise—and created the industry we now call plastics.</p>
<p class="para">These are “big-company” stories, it will be said. But Hoffmann-LaRoche was not a big company when it started. And here are some more recent examples of companies that started from nothing with a strategy of getting there “Fustest with the Mostest.”</p>
<p class="para">The word processor is not much of a “scientific” invention. It hooks up three existing instruments: a typewriter, a display screen, and a fairly elementary computer. But this combination of existing elements has resulted in a genuine innovation that is radically changing office work. Dr. An Wang was a lone entrepreneur when he conceived of the combination some time in the mid-fifties. He had no track record as an entrepreneur and a minimum of financial backing. Yet he clearly aimed from the beginning at creating a new industry and at changing office work—and Wang Laboratories has, of course, become a very big company.</p>
<p class="para">Similarly, the two young engineers who started the Apple computer in the proverbial garage, without financial backers or previous business experience, aimed from the beginning at creating an industry and dominating it.</p>
<a id="page220" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Not every “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy needs to aim at creating a big business, though it must always aim at creating a business that dominates its market. The 3M Company in St. Paul, Minnesota, does not—as a matter of deliberate policy, it seems—attempt an innovation that might result in a big business by itself. Nor does Johnson &amp; Johnson, the health-care and hygiene producer. Both companies are among the most fertile and most successful innovators. Both look for innovations that will lead to medium-sized rather than to giant enterprises, which are, however, dominant in their markets.</p>
<p class="para">Being “Fustest with the Mostest” is not confined to businesses. It is also available to public-service institutions. When Wilhclm von Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809—an event mentioned before in this book—he clearly aimed at being “Fustest with the Mostest.” Prussia had just been defeated by Napoleon and had barely escaped total dismemberment. It was bankrupt, politically, militarily, and, above all, financially. It looked very much the way Germany was to look after Hitler’s defeat in 1945. Yet Humboldt went out to build the largest university the Western world had ever seen or heard of—three to four times as large as anything then in existence. He went out to hire the leading scholars in every single discipline, beginning with the foremost philosopher of the time, Georg W.F. Hegel. And he paid his professors up to ten times as much as professors had ever been paid before, at a period when first-class scholars were going begging since the Napoleonic wars had forced many old and famous universities to disband.</p>
<p class="para">A hundred years later, in the early years of this century, two surgeons in Rochester, an obscure Minnesota town far from population centers or medical schools, decided to establish a medical center based on totally new—and totally heretical—concepts of medical practice, and especially on building teams in which outstanding specialists would work together under a coordinating team leader. Frederick William Taylor, the so-called father of scientific management, had never met the Mayo Brothers. But in his well-known testimony before the Congress in 1911, he called the Mayo Clinic the “only complete and successful scientific management” he knew. These unknown provincial surgeons aimed from the beginning at dominance of the field, at attracting outstanding practitioners in every branch of medicine and the most gifted of the younger men, and at attracting also patients able and willing to pay what were then outrageous fees.</p>
<a id="page221" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">And twenty-five years later, the strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” was used by the March of Dimes to organize research into infantile paralysis (polio). Instead of aiming at gathering new knowledge step by step, as all earlier medical research had done, the March of Dimes aimed from the beginning at total victory over a completely mysterious disease. No one before had ever organized a “research lab without walls,” in which a large number of scientists in a multitude of research institutions were commissioned to work on specific stages of a planned and managed research program. The March of Dimes established the pattern on which the United States, a little later, organized the first great research projects of World War II: the atom bomb, the radar lab, the proximity fuse, and then another fifteen years later, “Putting a Man on the Moon”—all innovative efforts using the “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy.</p>
<p class="para">These examples show, first, that being “Fustest with the Mostest” requires an ambitious aim; otherwise it is bound to fail. It always aims at creating a new industry or a new market. At the least, as in the case of the Mayo Clinic or the March of Dimes, being “Fustest with the Mostest” aims at creating a quite different and highly unconventional process. The DuPonts surely did not say to themselves in the mid-twenties when they brought in Carothers: “We will establish the plastics industry” (indeed, the term was rarely used until the 1950s). But enough of the internal DuPont documents of the time have been published to show that the top management people did aim at creating a new industry. They were far from convinced that Carothers and his research would succeed. But they knew that they would have founded something big and brand new in the event of success, and something that would go far beyond a single product or even beyond a single major product line. Dr. Wang did not coin the term “the Office of the Future,” as far as I know. But in his first advertisements, he announced a new office environment and new concepts of office work. Both the DuPonts and Wang from the beginning clearly aimed at dominating the industry they hoped they would succeed in creating.</p>
<p class="para">The best example of what is implied in the strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” is not a business case but Humboldt’s University of Berlin. Humboldt was actually not a bit interested in a university, as such. It was for him the means to create a new and different <span class="italic">political</span> order, which would be neither the absolute monarchy of the eighteenth century nor the democracy of the French Revolution in which the <a id="page222" class="calibre"></a>bourgeoisie ruled. Rather, it would be a balanced system, in which a totally apolitical professional civil service and an equally apolitical professional officer corps, recruited and promoted strictly by merit, would be autonomous in their very narrow spheres. These people—today we would call them technocrats—would have limited tasks and would be under the strict supervision of an independent professional judiciary. But within these limits they would be the masters. There would then be two spheres of individual freedom for the bourgeoisie, a moral and cultural one, and an economic one.</p>
<p class="para">Humboldt had presented this concept earlier in book form.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote28.html" id="footnote28" class="calibre"><sup class="calibre2">*</sup></a></span> After the total defeat of the Prussian monarchy by Napoleon in 1806, the collapse paralyzed all the forces that would otherwise have stopped Humboldt—the king, the aristocracy, the military. He ran with the opportunity and founded the University of Berlin as the main carrier of his political concepts, with brilliant success. The University of Berlin did indeed create the peculiar political structure the Germans in the nineteenth century called the <span class="italic">“Rechtsstaat”</span> (the Lawful State), in which an autonomous and self-governing elite of civil servants and general staff officers was in full control of the political and military sphere; an autonomous and self-governing elite of educated people <span class="italic">(“die Gebildeten Staende”)</span> organized around self-governing universities provided a “liberal” cultural sphere; and in which there was an autonomous and largely unrestricted economy. This structure first gave Prussia the moral and cultural, and soon thereafter the political and economic ascendancy in Germany. Both leadership in Europe and admiration outside of it followed in short order, especially on the part of the British and the Americans for whom the Germans, until 1890 or so, were the cultural and intellectual models. All this was exactly what Humboldt in the hour of darkest defeat and total despair had envisaged and aimed at. Indeed, he spelled out his aims clearly in the prospectus and the charter of his university.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps because “Fustest with the Mostest” must aim at creating something truly new, something truly different, nonexperts and outsiders seem to do as well as the experts, in fact, often better. HoffmannLaRoche, for instance, did not owe its strategy to chemists, but to a musician who had married the granddaughter of the company’s foun<a id="page223" class="calibre"></a>der and needed more money to support his orchestra than the company then provided through its meager dividends. To this day the company has never been managed by chemists, but always by financial men who have made their career in a major Swiss bank. Wilhelm von Humboldt himself was a diplomat with no earlier ties to academia or experience in it. The DuPont top management people were businessmen rather than chemists and researchers. And while the Brothers Mayo were well-trained surgeons, they were totally outside the medical establishment of the time and isolated from it.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, there are also the true “insiders,” Dr. Wang or the people at 3M or the young computer engineers who designed the Apple computer. But when it comes to being “Fustest with the Mostest,” the outsider may have an advantage. He does not know what everybody within the field knows, and therefore does not know what cannot be done.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">II</p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">The strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” has to hit right on target or it misses altogether. Or, to vary the metaphor, being “Fustest with the Mostest” is very much like a moon shot: a deviation of a fraction of a minute of the arc and the missile disappears into outer space. And once launched, the “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy is difficult to adjust or to correct.</p>
<p class="para">To use this strategy, in other words, requires thought and careful analysis. The entrepreneur of so much of the popular literature or of Hollywood movies, the person who suddenly has a “brilliant idea” and rushes off to put it into effect, is not going to succeed with it. In fact, for this strategy to succeed at all, the innovation must be based on a careful and deliberate attempt to exploit one of the major opportunities for innovation that were discussed in Chapters 3 to 9.</p>
<p class="para">There is, for instance, no better example of exploiting a <span class="italic">change in perception</span> than Humboldt’s University of Berlin. The French Revolution with its Terror, followed by Napoleon’s ruthless wars of conquest, had left the educated bourgeoisie disillusioned with politics; and yet they also quite clearly would have rejected any attempt to move the clock back and return to the absolute monarchy of the eighteenth century, let alone to feudalism. They needed a “liberal” but apolitical sphere, coupled with an apolitical government based on the same prin<a id="page224" class="calibre"></a>ciples of law and education in which they themselves believed. And all of them at the time were followers of Adam Smith, whose Wealth of Nations was probably the most widely read and most highly respected political book of the period. It was this which Humboldt’s political structure exploited and which his plan for the University of Berlin translated into institutional reality.</p>
<p class="para">Wang’s word processor brilliantly exploited a process need. By the 1970s the fear of the computer that had been rampant in offices only a little while earlier was beginning to be replaced by the question, “And what will the computer do for me?” By that time, office workers had become familiar with the computer in such activities as making payroll or controlling inventories; they also by that time had acquired office copiers so that the paperload in every office was going up very sharply. Wang’s word processor then addressed itself to the one remaining nonautomated chore, a chore every office worker hated: rewriting letters, speeches, reports, manuscripts to embody minor changes, and having to do so again and again.</p>
<p class="para">Hoffmann-LaRoche, in picking the vitamins in the early twenties, exploited new knowledge. The musician who laid down its strategy understood the “structure of scientific revolutions” a full thirty years before a philosopher, Thomas Kuhn, wrote the celebrated book by that title. He understood that a new basic theorem in science, even though buttressed by enough evidence to make it impossible to reject, will still not be accepted by a majority of scientists should it conflict with basic theorems they have grown up with and hold as articles of faith. They pay no attention to it for a long time, until the old “paradigm,” the old basic theory, becomes totally untenable. And during that time those who accept the new theorem and run with it have the field all to themselves.</p>
<p class="para">Only with such a base in careful analysis can the strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” possibly succeed.</p>
<p class="para">Even then, it requires extreme concentration of effort. There has to be one clear-cut goal and all efforts have to be focused on it. And when this effort begins to produce results, the innovator has to be ready to mobilize resources massively. As soon as DuPont had a usable synthetic fiber—long before the market had begun to respond to it—the company built large factories and bombarded both textile manufacturers and the general public with advertisements, trial presentations, and samples.</p>
<a id="page225" class="calibre"></a>
<p class="para">Then, after the innovation has become a successful business, the work really begins. Then the strategy of “Fustest with the Mostest” demands substantial and continuing efforts to retain a leadership position; otherwise, all one has done is create a market for a competitor. The innovator has to run even harder now that he has leadership than he ran before and to continue his innovative efforts on a very large scale. The research budget must be higher after the innovation has successfully been accomplished than it was before. New uses have to be found; new customers must be identified, and persuaded to try the new materials. Above all, the entrepreneur who has succeeded in being “Fustest with the Mostest” has to make his product or his process obsolete before a competitor can do it. Work on the successor to the successful product or process has to start immediately, with the same concentration of effort and the same investment of resources that led to the initial success.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, the entrepreneur who has attained leadership by being “Fustest with the Mostest” has to be the one who systematically cuts the price of his own product or process. To keep prices high simply holds an umbrella over potential competitors and encourages them (on this, see the next chapter, “Hit Them Where They Ain’t”).</p>
<p class="para">This was established by the longest-lived private monopoly in economic history, the Dynamite Cartel, founded by Alfred Nobel after his invention of dynamite. The Dynamite Cartel maintained a worldwide monopoly until World War I and even beyond, long after the Nobel patents had expired. It did this by cutting price every time demand rose by 10 to 20 percent. By that time, the companies in the cartel had fully depreciated the investment they had had to make to get the additional production. This made it unattractive for any potential competitor to build new dynamite factories, while the cartel itself maintained its profitability. It is no accident that DuPont has consistently followed this policy in the United States, for the DuPont Company was the American member of the Dynamite Cartel. But Wang has done the same with respect to the word processor, Apple with respect to its computers, and 3M with respect to all its products.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA">III</p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">These are all success stories. They do not show how risky the strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” actually is. The failures disap<a id="page226" class="calibre"></a>peared. Yet we know that for everyone who succeeds with this strategy, many more fail. There is only one chance with the “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy. If it does not work right away, it is a total failure.</p>
<p class="para">Everyone knows the old Swiss story of Wilhelm Tell the archer, whom the tyrant promised to pardon if he succeeded in shooting an apple off his son’s head on the first try. If he failed, he would either kill the child or be killed himself. This is exactly the situation of the entrepreneur in the “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy. There can be no “almost-success” or “near-miss.” There is only success or failure.</p>
<p class="para">Even the successes may be perceived only by hindsight. At least we know that in two of the examples failure was very close; a combination of luck and chance saved them.</p>
<p class="para">Nylon only succeeded because of a fluke. There was no market for a synthetic fiber in the mid-thirties. It was far too expensive to compete with cotton and rayon, the cheap fibers of the time, and was actually even more expensive than silk, the luxury fiber which the Japanese in the severe depression of the late thirties had to sell for whatever price they could get What saved Nylon was the outbreak of World War II, which stopped Japanese silk exports. By the time the Japanese could start up their silk industry again, around 1950 or so, Nylon was firmly entrenched, with its cost and price down to a fraction of what both had been in the late thirties. The story of 3M’s best known product, Scotch Tape, was told earlier. Again, but for pure accident, Scotch Tape would have been a failure.</p>
<p class="para">The strategy of being “Fustest with the Mostest” is indeed so risky that an entire major strategy—the one that will be discussed in the next chapter under the heading Creative Imitation—is based on the assumption that being “Fustest with the Mostest” will fail far more often than it can possibly succeed. It will fail because the will is lacking. It will fail because efforts are inadequate. It will fail because, despite successful innovation, not enough resources are deployed, are available, or are being put to work to exploit success, and so on. While the strategy is indeed highly rewarding when successful, it is much too risky and much too difficult to be used for anything but major innovations, for creating a new political order as Humboldt successfully did, or a whole new field of therapy as Hoffmann-LaRoche did with the vitamins, or a new approach to medical diagnosis and practice as the Mayo Brothers set out to do. In effect, it fits a fairly small minority of innovations. It requires profound analysis and a genuine understanding of the sources of inno<a id="page227" class="calibre"></a>vation and of their dynamics. It requires an extreme concentration of effort and substantial resources. In most cases alternative strategies are available and preferable—not primarily because they carry less risk, but because for most innovations the opportunity is not great enough to justify the cost, the effort, and the investment of resources required for the “Fustest with the Mostest” strategy.</p>

<div class="contents">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Most of the literature on entrepreneurship <span class="italic">is</span> anecdotal and of the “Look, Ma, no hands” variety. The best of that genre may be the book by George Gilder: <span class="italic">The Spirit of Enterprise</span> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1984). It consists mainly of stories of individuals who have founded new businesses; there is little discussion of what one can learn from their example. The book limits itself to new small businesses and omits discussion of entrepreneurship in both the existing business and the public-service institution. But at least Gilder does not make the mistake of confining entrepreneurship to high tech.</p>
<p class="para">Far more useful to the entrepreneur—and to those who want to understand entrepreneurship—are the studies by Karl H. Vesper of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, especially his <span class="italic">New Venture Strategy</span> (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1980), and his annual publication, <span class="italic">Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research</span> (Babson Park, Mass.: Babson College). Vesper, too, confines himself to the new and especially to the small business. But within these limits, his stimulating works are full of insights and practical wisdom.</p>
<p class="para">The Center for Entrepreneurial Management (83 Spring Street, New York, N.Y. 10012), founded and directed by Joseph R. Mancuso, focuses entirely on “How to Do It” in the small business, as does Mancuso’s well-known text <span class="italic">How to Start, Finance and Manage Your Own Small Business</span> (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978).</p>
<p class="para">Entrepreneurial management in the existing and especially in the large business is the subject of two very different books that complement each other. Andrew S. Grove, one of the founders and now the president of Intel Corporation, discusses the policies and practices needed to maintain entrepreneurship in the business that has grown fast and to large size in his <span class="italic">High-Output Management</span> (New York: Random House, 1983). Rosabeth M. Canter, an organizational psycholo<a id="page276" class="calibre"></a>gist at Yale University, discusses the attitudes and behavior of corporate leaders in entrepreneurial companies in her book <span class="italic">The Change Masters</span> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1983). By far the most penetrating discussion of entrepreneurship in existing businesses is the almost inaccessible article by two members of the consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Company, Richard E. Cavenaugh and Donald K. Clifford, Jr.: “Lessons from America’s Mid-Sized Growth Companies,” <span class="italic">McKinsey Quarterly</span> (Autumn 1983). Publication of a book by the same authors, based on the article and the study on which it reports, is expected in 1985 or 1986.</p>
<p class="para">Of the many books on strategy, the most useful may be Michael Porter’s <span class="italic">Competitive Strategies</span> (New York: Free Press, 1980).</p>
<p class="para">In my own earlier works, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial management are discussed in <span class="italic">Managing for Results</span> (New York: Harper <span class="italic">&amp;</span> Row, 1964), especially Chapters 1—5, and in <span class="italic">Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</span> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973), Chapters 11–14 (The Service Institution) and Chapters 53–61 (Strategies and Structures).</p>

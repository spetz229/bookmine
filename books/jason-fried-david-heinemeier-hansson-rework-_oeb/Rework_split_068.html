<p class="calibre7">How should you keep track of what customers want? Don't. Listen, but then forget what people said. Seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre17">There's no need for a spreadsheet, database, or filing system. The requests that really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over. After a while, you won't be able to forget them. Your customers will be your memory. They'll keep reminding you. They'll show you which things you truly need to worry about.</p>
<p class="calibre17">If there's a request that you keep forgetting, that's a sign that it isn't very important. The really important stuff doesn't go away.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_100"></div></div>

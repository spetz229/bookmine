<p class="calibre7">The business world is full of "professionals" who wear the uniform and try to seem perfect. In truth, they just come off as stiff and boring. No one can relate to people like that.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real. It's why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. Don't worry about how you're supposed to sound and how you're supposed to act. Show the world what you're really like, warts and all.</p>
<p class="calibre17">There's a beauty to imperfection. This is the essence of the Japanese principle of <em class="italic1">wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi</em> values character and uniqueness over a shiny facade. It teaches that cracks and scratches in things should be embraced. It's also about simplicity. You strip things down and then use what you have. Leonard Koren, author of a book on <em class="italic1">wabi-sabi</em>, gives this advice: Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things clean and unencumbered but don't sterilize.<a id="filepos185168" class="calibre16"></a><a href="Rework_split_085.html#filepos197153" class="calibre9"><sup class="calibre20"><span class="calibre6">*</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre17">It's a beautiful way to put it: Leave the poetry in <a class="calibre16"></a>what you make. When something becomes too polished, it loses its soul. It seems robotic.</p>
<p class="calibre17">So talk like you really talk. Reveal things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, even if you're not done yet. It's OK if it's not perfect. You might not seem as professional, but you will seem a lot more genuine.</p>

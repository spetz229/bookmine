<p class="calibre7">"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"</p>
<p class="calibre17">Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a <em class="italic1">real</em> problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary.</p>
<p class="calibre17">At this stage, it's silly to worry about whether or not your concept will scale from five to five thousand people (or from a hundred thousand to 100 million people). Getting a product or service off the ground is hard enough without inventing even more obstacles. Optimize for now and worry about the future later.</p>
<p class="calibre17">The ability to change course is one of the big advantages of being small. Compared with larger competitors, you're way more capable of making quick, sweeping changes. Big companies just can't move that fast. So pay attention to today and worry about later when it gets here. Otherwise you'll waste energy, time, and money fixating on problems that may never materialize.</p>

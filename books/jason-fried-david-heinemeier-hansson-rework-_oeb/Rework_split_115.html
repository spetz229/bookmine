<p class="calibre7">The dream employee for a lot of companies is a twenty-something with as little of a life as possible outside of work--someone who'll be fine working fourteen-hour days and sleeping under his desk.</p>
<p class="calibre17">But packing a room full of these burn-the-midnight-oil types isn't as great as it seems. It lets you get away with lousy execution. It perpetuates myths like "This is the only way we can compete against the big guys." You don't need more hours; you need <em class="italic1">better</em> hours.</p>
<p class="calibre17">When people have something to do at home, they get down to business. They get their work done at the office because they have somewhere else to be. They find ways to be more efficient because they have to. They need to pick up the kids or get to choir practice. So they use their time wisely.</p>
<p class="calibre17">As the saying goes, "If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know." You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing. You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life--at least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.</p>

<p class="calibre7">Some companies are addicted to hiring. Some even hire when they aren't hiring. They'll hear about someone great and invent a position or title just to lure them in. And there they'll sit--parked in a position that doesn't matter, doing work that isn't important.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Pass on hiring people you don't need, even if you think that person's a great catch. You'll be doing your company more harm than good if you bring in talented people who have nothing important to do.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Problems start when you have more people than you need. You start inventing work to keep everyone busy. Artificial work leads to artificial projects. And those artificial projects lead to real costs and complexity.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Don't worry about "the one that got away." It's much worse to have people on staff who aren't doing anything meaningful. There's plenty of talent out there. When you do have a real need, you'll find someone who fits well.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Great has nothing to do with it. If you don't need someone, you don't need someone.</p>

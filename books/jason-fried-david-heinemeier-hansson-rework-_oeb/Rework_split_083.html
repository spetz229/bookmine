<p class="calibre7">Do you have a marketing department? If not, good. If you do, don't think these are the only people responsible for marketing. Accounting is a department. Marketing isn't. Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Just as you cannot not communicate, you cannot not market:</p>
<ul class="calibre23"><li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">Every time you answer the phone, it's marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">Every time you send an e-mail, it's marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">Every time someone uses your product, it's marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">Every word you write on your Web site is marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">If you build software, every error message is marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">If you're in the restaurant business, the after-dinner mint is marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">If you're in the retail business, the checkout counter is marketing.</p></li>
<li class="calibre24"><p class="calibre7">If you're in a service business, your invoice is marketing.</p></li>
</ul><p class="calibre17">Recognize that all of these little things are more important than choosing which piece of swag to throw into a conference goodie bag. Marketing isn't just a <a class="calibre16"></a>few individual events. It's the sum total of everything you do.</p>

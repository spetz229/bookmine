<p class="calibre7">The most common excuse people give: "There's not enough time." They claim they'd love to start a company, learn an instrument, market an invention, write a book, or whatever, but there just aren't enough hours in the day.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Come on. There's always enough time if you spend it right. And don't think you have to quit your day job, either. Hang onto it and start work on your project at night.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Instead of watching TV or playing World of Warcraft, work on your idea. Instead of going to bed at ten, go to bed at eleven. We're not talking about all-nighters or sixteen-hour days--we're talking about squeezing out a few extra hours a week. That's enough time to get something going.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Once you do that, you'll learn whether your excitement and interest is real or just a passing phase. If it doesn't pan out, you just keep going to work every day like you've been doing all along. You didn't risk or lose anything, other than a bit of time, so it's no big deal.</p>
<p class="calibre17">When you want something bad enough, you make the time--regardless of your other obligations. The truth is most people just don't want it bad enough. Then they protect their ego with the excuse of time. <a class="calibre16"></a>Don't let yourself off the hook with excuses. It's entirely your responsibility to make your dreams come true.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Besides, the <em class="italic1">perfect</em> time never arrives. You're always too young or old or busy or broke or something else. If you constantly fret about timing things perfectly, they'll never happen.</p>

<h2 id="filepos65837" class="calibre19"><span class="calibre2"><a class="calibre13"></a><strong class="calibre14">You need less than you think</strong></span></h2><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre7">Do you really need ten people or will two or three do for now?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need $500,000 or is $50,000 (or $5,000) enough for now?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need six months or can you make something in two?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need a big office or can you share office space (or work from home) for a while?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need a warehouse or can you rent a small storage space (or use your garage or basement) or outsource it completely?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need to buy advertising and hire a PR firm or are there other ways to get noticed?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need to build a factory or can you hire someone else to manufacture your products?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need an accountant or can you use Quicken and do it yourself?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need an IT department or can you outsource it?</p>
<p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre16"></a>Do you really need a full-time support person or can you handle inquiries on your own?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need to open a retail store or can you sell your product online?</p>
<p class="calibre11">Do you really need fancy business cards, letterhead, and brochures or can you forego that stuff?</p>
<p class="calibre11">    You get the point. Maybe eventually you'll need to go the bigger, more expensive route, but not right now.</p>
<p class="calibre17">There's nothing wrong with being frugal. When we launched our first product, we did it on the cheap. We didn't get our own office; we shared space with another company. We didn't get a bank of servers; we had only one. We didn't advertise; we promoted by sharing our experiences online. We didn't hire someone to answer customer e-mails; the company founder answered them himself. And everything worked out just fine.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too.</p>

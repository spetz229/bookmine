<h2 id="filepos166011" class="calibre19"><span class="calibre2"><a class="calibre13"></a><strong class="calibre14">Don't confuse enthusiasm with priority</strong></span></h2><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre7">Coming up with a great idea gives you a rush. You start imagining the possibilities and the benefits. And of course, you want all that right away. So you drop everything else you're working on and begin pursuing your latest, greatest idea.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Bad move. The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of its true worth. What seems like a sure-fire hit right now often gets downgraded to just a "nice to have" by morning. And "nice to have" isn't worth putting everything else on hold.</p>
<p class="calibre17">We have ideas for new features all the time. On top of that, we get dozens of interesting ideas from customers every day too. Sure, it'd be fun to immediately chase all these ideas to see where they lead. But if we did that, we'd just wind up running on a treadmill and never get anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre17">So let your latest grand ideas cool off for a while first. By all means, have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don't act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind.</p>

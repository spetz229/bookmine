<p class="calibre7">Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don't need heavy direction. They don't need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do--set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.--but they do it by themselves and for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre17">These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they've gotten done. They don't need a lot of hand-holding or supervision.</p>
<p class="calibre17">How can you spot these people? Look at their backgrounds. They have set the tone for how they've worked at other jobs. They've run something on their own or launched some kind of project.</p>
<p class="calibre17">You want someone who's capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through. Finding these people frees the rest of your team to work more and manage less.</p>

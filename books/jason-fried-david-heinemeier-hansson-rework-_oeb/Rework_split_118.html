<h2 id="filepos251913" class="calibre19"><span class="calibre2"><a class="calibre13"></a><strong class="calibre14">Four-letter words</strong></span></h2><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre7">There are four-letter words you should never use in business. They're not <em class="italic1">fuck</em> or <em class="italic1">shit</em>. They're <em class="italic1">need, must, can't, easy, just, only</em>, and <em class="italic1">fast</em>. These words get in the way of healthy communication. They are red flags that introduce animosity, torpedo good discussions, and cause projects to be late.</p>
<p class="calibre17">When you use these four-letter words, you create a black-and-white situation. But the truth is rarely black and white. So people get upset and problems ensue. Tension and conflict are injected unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Here's what's wrong with some of them:</p>
<div class="calibre4"><blockquote class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre22">Need</strong>. Very few things actually need to get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with that?"</p>
<p class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre22">Can't</strong>. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they?</p>
<p class="calibre11"><a class="calibre16"></a><strong class="calibre22">Easy</strong>. <em class="italic1">Easy</em> is a word that's used to describe other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?" But notice how rarely people describe their own tasks as easy. For you, it's "Let me look into it"--but for others, it's "Get it done."</p>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre17">These four-letter words often pop up during debates (and also watch out for their cousins: <em class="italic1">everyone, no one, always</em>, and <em class="italic1">never)</em>. Once uttered, they make it tough to find a solution. They box you into a corner by pitting two absolutes against each other. That's when head-butting occurs. You squeeze out any middle ground.</p>
<p class="calibre17">And these words are especially dangerous when you string them together: "We need to add this feature now. We can't launch without this feature. Everyone wants it. It's only one little thing so it will be easy. You should be able to get it in there fast!" Only thirty-six words, but a hundred assumptions. That's a recipe for disaster.</p>

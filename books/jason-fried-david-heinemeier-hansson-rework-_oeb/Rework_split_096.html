<p class="calibre7">With a small team, you need people who are going to <em class="italic1">do</em> work, not delegate work. Everyone's got to be producing. No one can be above the work.</p>
<p class="calibre17">That means you need to avoid hiring delegators, those people who love telling others what to do. Delegators are dead weight for a small team. They clog the pipes for others by coming up with busywork. And when they run out of work to assign, they make up more--regardless of whether it needs to be done.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Delegators love to pull people into meetings, too. In fact, meetings are a delegator's best friend. That's where he gets to seem important. Meanwhile, everyone else who attends is pulled away from getting real work done.</p>

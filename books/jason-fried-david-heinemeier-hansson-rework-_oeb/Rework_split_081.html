<strong class="calibre14"><em class="italic">Wall Street Journal</em></strong></span></h2><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre7">Forget about <em class="italic1">Time, Forbes, Newsweek, Business Week</em>, the <em class="italic1">New York Times</em>, and the <em class="italic1">Wall Street Journal</em>. Pitching a reporter at one of these places is practically impossible. Good luck even getting ahold of that guy. And even if you do, he probably won't care anyway. You're not big enough to matter.</p>
<p class="calibre17">You're better off focusing on getting your story into a trade publication or picked up by a niche blogger. With these outlets, the barrier is much lower. You can send an e-mail and get a response (and maybe even a post) the same day. There's no editorial board or PR person involved. There's no pipeline your message has to go through.</p>
<p class="calibre17">These guys are actually hungry for fresh meat. They thrive on being tastemakers, finding the new thing, and getting the ball rolling. That's why many big-time reporters now use these smaller sites to find new stories. Stories that start on the fringe can go mainstream quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre17">We've been written up in big mainstream publications like <em class="italic1">Wired</em> and <em class="italic1">Time</em>, but we've found that we actually get more hits when we're profiled on sites like Daring Fireball, a site for Mac nerds, or Lifehacker, a productivity site. Links from these places result in notable spikes in <a class="calibre16"></a>our traffic and sales. Articles in big-time publications are nice, but they don't result in the same level of direct, instant activity.</p>

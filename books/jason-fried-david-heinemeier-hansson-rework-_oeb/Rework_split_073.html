<p class="calibre7">You can advertise. You can hire salespeople. You can sponsor events. But your competitors are doing the same things. How does that help you stand out?</p>
<p class="calibre17">Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them. Teaching probably isn't something your competitors are even thinking about. Most businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them.</p>
<p class="calibre17">The Hoefler Type Foundry teaches designers about type at <a href="http://Typography.com" class="calibre9">Typography.com</a>. Etsy, an online store for things handmade, holds entrepreneurial workshops that explain "best practices" and promotional ideas to people who sell at the site. Gary Vaynerchuk, who owns a large wine shop, teaches people about wine online at Wine Library TV, and tens of thousands of people watch every day.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Teach and you'll form a bond you just don't get from traditional marketing tactics. Buying people's attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing. Earning their loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection. They'll trust you more. They'll respect you more. Even if they don't use your product, they can still be your fans.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Teaching is something individuals and small companies <a class="calibre16"></a>can do that bigger competitors can't. Big companies can afford a Super Bowl ad; you can't. But you can afford to teach, and that's something they'll never do, because big companies are obsessed with secrecy. Everything at those places has to get filtered through a lawyer and go through layers of red tape. Teaching is your chance to outmaneuver them.</p>

<p class="calibre7">Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works. Imagine that someone wanted to make a reality show about your business. What would they share? Now stop waiting for someone else and do it yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Think no one will care? Think again. Even seemingly boring jobs can be fascinating when presented right. What could be more boring than commercial fishing and trucking? Yet the Discovery Channel and History Channel have turned these professions into highly rated shows: <em class="italic1">Deadliest Catch</em> and <em class="italic1">Ice Road Truckers</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre17">It doesn't need to be a dangerous job, either. People love finding out the little secrets of all kinds of businesses, even one that makes those tiny marshmallows in breakfast cereals. That's why the Food Network's <em class="italic1">Unwrapped--</em>which explores the secrets behind lunch-box treats, soda pop, movie candy, and more--is such a popular program.</p>
<p class="calibre17">People are curious about how things are made. It's why they like factory tours or behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs. They want to see how the sets are built, how the animation is done, how the director cast the film, etc. They want to know how and why other people make decisions.</p>
<p class="calibre17"><a class="calibre16"></a>Letting people behind the curtain changes your relationship with them. They'll feel a bond with you and see you as human beings instead of a faceless company. They'll see the sweat and effort that goes into what you sell. They'll develop a deeper level of understanding and appreciation for what you do.</p>

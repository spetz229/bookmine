<h2 id="filepos68745" class="calibre19"><span class="calibre2"><a class="calibre13"></a><strong class="calibre14">Start a business, not a startup</strong></span></h2><div class="calibre4"></div>
<p class="calibre7">Ah, the startup. It's a special breed of company that gets a lot of attention (especially in the tech world).</p>
<p class="calibre17">The start up is a magical place. It's a place where expenses are someone else's problem. It's a place where that pesky thing called revenue is never an issue. It's a place where you can spend other people's money until you figure out a way to make your own. It's a place where the laws of business physics don't apply.</p>
<p class="calibre17">The problem with this magical place is it's a fairy tale. The truth is every business, new or old, is governed by the same set of market forces and economic rules. Revenue in, expenses out. Turn a profit or wind up gone.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Startups try to ignore this reality. They are run by people trying to postpone the inevitable, i.e., that moment when their business has to grow up, turn a profit, and be a real, sustainable business.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Anyone who takes a "we'll figure out how to profit in the future" attitude to business is being ridiculous. That's like building a rocket ship but starting off by saying, "Let's pretend gravity doesn't exist." <em class="italic1">A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre17">So don't use the idea of a startup as a crutch. Instead, start an actual business. Actual businesses have to <a class="calibre16"></a>deal with actual things like bills and payroll. Actual businesses worry about profit from day one. Actual businesses don't mask deep problems by saying, "It's OK, we're a startup." Act like an actual business and you'll have a much better shot at succeeding.</p>

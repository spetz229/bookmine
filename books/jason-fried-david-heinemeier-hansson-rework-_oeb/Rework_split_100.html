<p class="calibre7">It's crazy not to hire the best people just because they live far away. Especially now that there's so much technology out there making it easier to bring everyone together online.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Our headquarters are in Chicago, but more than half of our team lives elsewhere. We've got people in Spain, Canada, Idaho, Oklahoma, and elsewhere. Had we limited our search only to people in Chicago, we would have missed out on half of the great people we have.</p>
<p class="calibre17">To make sure your remote team stays in touch, have at least a few hours a day of real-time overlap. Working in time zones where there's no workday overlap at all is tough. If you face that situation, someone might need to shift hours a bit so they start a little later or earlier in the day, so you're available at the same time. You don't need eight hours of overlap, though. (Actually, we've found it preferable to <em class="italic1">not</em> have complete overlap--you get more alone time that way.) Two to four hours of overlap should be plenty.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Also, meet in person once in a while. You should see each other at least every few months. We make sure our whole team gets together a few times a year. These are great times to review progress, discuss what's going <a class="calibre16"></a>right or wrong, plan for the future, and get reacquainted with one another on a personal level.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Geography just doesn't matter anymore. Hire the best talent, regardless of where it is.</p>

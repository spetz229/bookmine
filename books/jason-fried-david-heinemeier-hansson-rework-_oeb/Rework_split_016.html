<p class="calibre7">We all have that one friend who says, "I had the idea for eBay. If only I had acted on it, I'd be a billionaire!" That logic is pathetic and delusional. Having the idea for eBay has nothing to do with actually creating eBay. What you <em class="italic1">do</em> is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Think your idea's that valuable? Then go try to sell it and see what you get for it. <em class="italic1">Not much</em> is probably the answer. Until you actually start making something, your brilliant idea is just that, an idea. And everyone's got one of those.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Stanley Kubrick gave this advice to aspiring filmmakers: "Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all."<a id="filepos51688" class="calibre16"></a><a href="Rework_split_027.html#filepos77868" class="calibre9"><sup class="calibre20"><span class="calibre6">*</span></sup></a> Kubrick knew that when you're new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin. So get a camera, hit Record, and start shooting.</p>
<p class="calibre17">Ideas are cheap and plentiful. The original pitch idea is such a small part of a business that it's almost negligible. The real question is how well you execute.</p>

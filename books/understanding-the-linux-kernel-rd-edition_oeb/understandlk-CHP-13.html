<div class="calibre23"></div><h2 class="docPrefaceTitle">Chapter 13. I/O Architecture and Device Drivers</h2>
<p class="docText1">The Virtual File System in the last chapter depends on lower-level functions to carry out each read, write, or other operation in a manner suited to each device. The previous chapter included a brief discussion of how operations are handled by different filesystems. In this chapter, we look at how the kernel invokes the operations on actual devices.</p>
<p class="docText1">In the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-1.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-1">I/O Architecture</a>," we give a brief survey of the 80 x 86 I/O architecture. In the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-2.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-2">The Device Driver Model</a>," we introduce the Linux device driver model. Next, in the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-3.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-3">Device Files</a>," we show how the VFS associates a special file called "device file" with each different hardware device, so that application programs can use all kinds of devices in the same way. We then introduce in the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-4.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-4">Device Drivers</a>" some common characteristics of device drivers. Finally, in the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-5.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-5">Character Device Drivers</a>," we illustrate the overall organization of character device drivers in Linux. We'll defer the discussion of block device drivers to the next chapters.</p>
<p class="docText1">Readers interested in developing device drivers on their own may want to refer to Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman's <span class="docEmphasis">Linux Device Drivers</span>, Third Edition (O'Reilly).</p>

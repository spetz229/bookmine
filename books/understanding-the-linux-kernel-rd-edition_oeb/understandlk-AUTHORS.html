About the Authors
<p class="docText1"><span class="calibre5">Daniel P. Bovet</span> received his Ph.D. in computer science at UCLA in 1968 and is a full professor at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy. He had to wait over 25 years before being able to teach an operating systems course in a proper manner, due to the lack of source code for modern, well-designed systems. Now, thanks to cheap PCs and Linux, Dan and Marco are able to cover all the facets of an operating system and can hand out tough, satisfying homework to their students. (These young students working at home on their PCs are really spoiled; they never had to fight with punched cards.) In fact, Dan was so fascinated by the accomplishments of Linus Torvalds and his followers that he spent the last few years trying to unravel some of Linux's mysteries. It seemed natural, after all that work, to write a book about what he found.</p>
<p class="docText1"><span class="calibre5">Marco Cesati</span> received a degree in mathematics in 1992 and a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Rome, La Sapienza, in 1995. He is now a research assistant in the computer science department of the School of Engineering at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata. In the past, he has served as a system administrator and Unix programmer for the university (as a Ph.D. student) and for several institutions (as a consultant). During the last few years, he has been continuously involved in teaching his students how to change the Linux kernel in strange and funny ways.</p>

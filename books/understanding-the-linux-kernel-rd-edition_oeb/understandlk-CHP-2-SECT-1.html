<p class="docText1">Programmers casually refer to a <span class="docEmphasis">memory address</span> as the way to access the contents of a memory cell. But when dealing with 80 x 86 microprocessors, we have to distinguish three kinds of addresses:</p>
<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0301"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0302"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0303"></a><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0304"></a><dl class="docText1"><dt class="calibre7"><br class="calibre7"/><p class="calibre14"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">Logical address</span></span></p></dt>
<dd class="calibre20"><p class="docList">Included in the machine language instructions to specify the address of an operand or of an instruction. This type of address embodies the well-known 80 x 86 segmented architecture that forces MS-DOS<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0301"></a> 
 and Windows<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0302"></a> 
 programmers to divide their programs into segments<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0303"></a> 
. Each logical address consists of a <span class="docEmphasis">segment</span> and an <span class="docEmphasis">offset</span><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0304"></a> 
 (or <span class="docEmphasis">displacement</span>) that denotes the distance from the start of the segment to the actual address.</p></dd><dt class="calibre7"><br class="calibre7"/><p class="calibre14"><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">Linear address</span> (also known as virtual address)</span></p></dt>

<p class="docText1">The Memory Management Unit (MMU) transforms a logical address into a linear address by means of a hardware circuit called a segmentation unit<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0305"></a> 
; subsequently, a second hardware circuit called a paging unit<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0306"></a> 
 transforms the linear address into a physical address (see <a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="#understandlk-CHP-2-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</a>).</p>

<p class="docText1">In multiprocessor systems, all CPUs usually share the same memory; this means that RAM chips may be accessed concurrently by independent CPUs. Because read or write operations on a RAM chip must be performed serially, a hardware circuit called a <span class="docEmphasis">memory arbiter</span> is inserted between the bus and every RAM chip. Its role is to grant access to a CPU if the chip is free and to delay it if the chip is busy servicing a request by another processor. Even uniprocessor systems use memory arbiters<a name="IDX-CHP-2-0307"></a> 
, because they include specialized processors called <span class="docEmphasis">DMA controllers</span><a name="IDX-CHP-2-0308"></a> 
 that operate concurrently with the CPU (see the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-4.html#understandlk-CHP-13-SECT-4.5">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>" in <a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13.html#understandlk-CHP-13">Chapter 13</a>). In the case of multiprocessor systems, the structure of the arbiter is more complex because it has more input ports. The dual Pentium, for instance, maintains a two-port arbiter at each chip entrance and requires that the two CPUs exchange synchronization messages before attempting to use the common bus. From the programming point of view, the arbiter is hidden because it is managed by hardware circuits.</p>

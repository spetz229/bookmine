<div class="calibre23"></div><h2 class="docPrefaceTitle">Chapter 7. Process Scheduling</h2>
<p class="docText1">Like every time sharing<a name="IDX-CHP-7-1810"></a> 
 system, Linux achieves the magical effect of an apparent simultaneous execution of multiple processes by switching from one process to another in a very short time frame. Process switching itself was discussed in <a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-3.html#understandlk-CHP-3">Chapter 3</a>; this chapter deals with <span class="docEmphasis">scheduling</span><a name="IDX-CHP-7-1811"></a> 
, which is concerned with when to switch and which process to choose.</p>
<p class="docText1">The chapter consists of three parts. The section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-1.html#understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-1">Scheduling Policy</a>" introduces the choices made by Linux in the abstract to schedule processes. The section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-2.html#understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-2">The Scheduling Algorithm</a>" discusses the data structures used to implement scheduling and the corresponding algorithm. Finally, the section "<a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-6.html#understandlk-CHP-7-SECT-6">System Calls Related to Scheduling</a>" describes the system calls that affect process scheduling.</p>
<p class="docText1">To simplify the description, we refer as usual to the 80 x 86 architecture; in particular, we assume that the system uses the Uniform Memory Access model, and that the system tick is set to 1 ms.</p>

<p class="docText1">Signals were introduced by the first Unix systems to allow interactions between User Mode processes; the kernel also uses them to notify processes of system events. Signals have been around for 30 years with only minor changes.</p>
<p class="docText1">The first sections of this chapter examine in detail how signals<a name="IDX-CHP-11-2592"></a> 
 are handled by the Linux kernel, then we discuss the system calls that allow processes to exchange signals.</p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title">Organization of the Material</h3>
<p class="docText1">When we began to write this book, we were faced with a critical decision: should we refer to a specific hardware platform or skip the hardware-dependent details and concentrate on the pure hardware-independent parts of the kernel?</p>
<p class="docText1">Others books on Linux kernel internals have chosen the latter approach; we decided to adopt the former one for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="calibre11"><li class="calibre12"><p class="docText1">Efficient kernels take advantage of most available hardware features, such as addressing techniques, caches, processor exceptions, special instructions, processor control registers, and so on. If we want to convince you that the kernel indeed does quite a good job in performing a specific task, we must first tell what kind of support comes from the hardware.</p></li><li class="calibre12"><p class="docText1">Even if a large portion of a Unix kernel source code is processor-independent and coded in C language, a small and critical part is coded in assembly language. A thorough knowledge of the kernel, therefore, requires the study of a few assembly language fragments that interact with the hardware.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText1">When covering hardware features, our strategy is quite simple: only sketch the features that are totally hardware-driven while detailing those that need some software support. In fact, we are interested in kernel design rather than in computer architecture.</p>
<p class="docText1">Our next step in choosing our path consisted of selecting the computer system to describe. Although Linux is now running on several kinds of personal computers and workstations, we decided to concentrate on the very popular and cheap IBM-compatible personal computersand thus on the 80 x 86 microprocessors and on some support chips included in these personal computers. The term 80 x 86 <span class="docEmphasis">microprocessor</span> will be used in the forthcoming chapters to denote the Intel 80386, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium 4 microprocessors or compatible models. In a few cases, explicit references will be made to specific models.</p>
<p class="docText1">One more choice we had to make was the order to follow in studying Linux components. We tried a bottom-up approach: start with topics that are hardware-dependent and end with those that are totally hardware-independent. In fact, we'll make many references to the 80 x 86 microprocessors in the first part of the book, while the rest of it is relatively hardware-independent. Significant exceptions are made in <a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-13.html#understandlk-CHP-13">Chapter 13</a> and <a class="pcalibre5 docLink pcalibre1" href="understandlk-CHP-14.html#understandlk-CHP-14">Chapter 14</a>. In practice, following a bottom-up approach is not as simple as it looks, because the areas of memory management, process management, and filesystems are intertwined; a few forward referencesthat is, references to topics yet to be explainedare unavoidable.</p>
<p class="docText1">Each chapter starts with a theoretical overview of the topics covered. The material is then presented according to the bottom-up approach. We start with the data structures needed to support the functionalities described in the chapter. Then we usually move from the lowest level of functions to higher levels, often ending by showing how system calls issued by user applications are supported.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">A Feegle Glossary, adjusted for
those of a delicate disposition
(A Work in Progress by Miss Perspicacia Tick)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bigjobs: Human beings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Big Man: Chief of the clan (usually the husband of the kelda).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blethers: Rubbish, nonsense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Boggin': To be desperate, as in "I'm boggin' for a cup of tea."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bunty: A weak person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cack yer kecks: Er, to put it delicately…to be very, very frightened. As it were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Carlin: Old woman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Cludgie: The privy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crivens!: A general exclamation that can mean anything from "My goodness!" to "I've just lost my temper and there is going to be trouble."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dree your/my/his/her weird: Face the fate that is in store for you/me/him/her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Een: Eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Eldritch: Weird, strange. Sometimes means oblong, too, for some reason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fash: Worry, upset.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Geas: A very important obligation, backed up by tradition and magic. Not a bird.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Gonnagle: The bard of the clan, skilled in musical instruments, poems, stories, and songs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hag: A witch of any age.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hag o' hags: A very important witch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hagging/Haggling: Anything a witch does.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hiddlins: Secrets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Kelda: The female head of the clan, and eventually the mother of most of it. Feegle babies are very small, and a kelda will have hundreds in her lifetime.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lang syne: Long ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Last World: The Feegles believe that they are dead. This world is so nice, they argue, that they must have been really good in a past life and then died and ended up here. Appearing to die here means merely going back to the Last World, which they believe is rather dull.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mudlin: Useless person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Pished: I am assured that this means "tired."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Schemie: An unpleasant person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Scuggan: A really unpleasant person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Scunner: A generally unpleasant person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ships: Woolly things that eat grass and go baa. Easily confused with the other kind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Spavie: See Mudlin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Special Sheep Liniment: Probably moonshine whisky, I am very sorry to say. No one knows what it'd do to sheep, but it is said that a drop of it is good for shepherds on a cold winter's night and for Feegles at any time at all. Do not try to make this at home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Spog: A leather pouch, worn on the front of his belt, where a Feegle keeps his valuables and uneaten food, interesting insects, useful bits of twig, lucky dirt, and so on. It is not a good idea to fish around in a spog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Steamie: Found only in the big Feegle mounds in the mountains, where there's enough water to allow regular bathing; it's a kind of sauna. Feegles on the Chalk tend to rely on the fact that you can get only so much dirt on you before it starts to fall off of its own accord.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Waily: A general cry of despair.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">When the storm came, it hit the hills like a hammer. No sky should hold as much snow as this, and because no sky could, the snow fell, fell in a wall of white.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a small hill of snow where there had been, a few hours ago, a little cluster of thorn trees on an ancient mound. This time last year there had been a few early primroses; now there was just snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Part of the snow moved. A piece about the size of an apple rose up, with smoke pouring out around it. A hand no larger than a rabbit's paw waved the smoke away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A very small but very angry blue face, with the lump of snow still balanced on top of it, looked out at the sudden white wilderness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, crivens!" it grumbled. "Will ye no' look at this? 'Tis the work o' the Wintersmith! Noo there's a scunner that willna tak' ‘no' fra' an answer!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Other lumps of snow were pushed up. More heads peered out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh waily, waily, waily!" said one of them. "He's found the big wee hag again!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The first head turned toward this head, and said, "Daft Wullie?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, Rob?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Did I no' tell ye to lay off that waily business?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, Rob, ye did that," said the head addressed as Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So why did ye just do it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry, Rob. It kinda bursted oot."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's so dispiritin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry, Rob."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody sighed. "But I fear ye're right, Wullie. He's come for the big wee hag, right enough. Who's watchin' over her doon at the farm?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wee Dangerous Spike, Rob."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob looked up at clouds so full of snow that they sagged in the middle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Okay," he said, and sighed again. "It's time fra' the Hero."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He ducked out of sight, the plug of snow dropping neatly back into place, and slid down into the heart of the Feegle mound.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was quite big inside. A human could just about stand up in the middle, but would then bend double with coughing because the middle was where there was a hole to let smoke out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All around the inner wall were tiers of galleries, and every one of them was packed with Feegles. Usually the place was awash with noise, but now it was frighteningly quiet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody walked across the floor to the fire, where his wife, Jeannie, was waiting. She stood straight and proud, like a kelda should, but close up it seemed to him that she had been crying. He put his arm around her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right, ye probably ken what's happenin'," he told the blue-and-red audience looking down on him. "This is nae common storm. The Wintersmith has found the big wee hag—noo then, settle doon!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He waited until the shouting and sword rattling had died down, then went on: "We canna fight the Wintersmith for her! That's her road! We canna walk it for her! But the hag o' hags has set us on another path! It's a dark one, and dangerous!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A cheer went up. Feegles liked the idea of this, at least.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Right!" said Rob, satisfied. "Ah'm awa' tae fetch the Hero!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a lot of laughter at this, and Big Yan, the tallest of the Feegles, shouted, "It's tae soon. We've only had time tae gie him a couple o' heroing lessons! He's still nae more than a big streak o' nothin'!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He'll be a Hero for the big wee hag and that's an end o' it," said Rob sharply. "Noo, off ye go, the whole boilin' o' ye! Tae the chalk pit! Dig me a path tae the Underworld!"</div>

      <div class="paragraph">It had to be the Wintersmith, Tiffany Aching told herself, standing in front of her father in the freezing farmhouse. She could feel it out there. This wasn't normal weather even for midwinter, and this was springtime. It was a challenge. Or perhaps it was just a game. It was hard to tell, with the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Only it can't be a game because the lambs are dying. I'm only just thirteen, and my father, and a lot of other people older than me, want me to do something. And I can't. The Wintersmith has found me again. He is here now, and I'm too weak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It would be easier if they were bullying me, but no, they're begging. My father's face is gray with worry and he's begging. My father is begging me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh no, he's taking his hat off. He's taking off his hat to speak to me!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They think magic comes free when I snap my fingers. But if I can't do this for them, now, what good am I? I can't let them see I'm afraid. Witches aren't allowed to be afraid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And this is my fault. I: I started all this. I must finish it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mr. Aching cleared his throat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"…And, er, if you could…er, magic it away, uh, or something? For us…?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everything in the room was gray, because the light from the windows was coming through snow. No one had wasted time digging the horrible stuff away from the houses. Every person who could hold a shovel was needed elsewhere, and still there were not enough of them. As it was, most people had been up all night, walking the flocks of yearlings, trying to keep the new lambs safe…in the dark, in the snow….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her snow. It was a message to her. A challenge. A summons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right," she said. "I'll see what I can do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good girl," said her father, grinning with relief. No, not a good girl, thought Tiffany. I brought this on us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You'll have to make a big fire, up by the sheds," she said aloud. "I mean a big fire, do you understand? Make it out of anything that will burn, and you must keep it going. It'll keep trying to go out, but you must keep it going. Keep piling on the fuel, whatever happens. The fire must not go out!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She made sure that the "not!" was loud and frightening. She didn't want people's minds to wander. She put on the heavy brown woollen cloak that Miss Treason had made for her and grabbed the black pointy hat that hung on the back of the farmhouse door. There was a sort of communal grunt from the people who'd crowded into the kitchen, and some of them backed away. We want a witch now, we need a witch now, but—we'll back away now, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was the magic of the pointy hat. It was what Miss Treason called "Boffo."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany Aching stepped out into the narrow corridor that had been cut through the snow-filled farmyard where the drifts were more than twice the height of a man. At least the deep snow kept off the worst of the wind, which was made of knives.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A track had been cleared all the way to the paddock, but it had been heavy going. When there are fifteen feet of snow everywhere, how can you clear it? Where can you clear it to?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She waited by the cart sheds while the men hacked and scraped at the snowbanks. They were tired to the bone by now; they'd been digging for hours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The important thing was—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But there were lots of important things. It was important to look calm and confident, it was important to keep your mind clear, it was important not to show how pants-wettingly scared you were….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She held out a hand, caught a snowflake, and took a good look at it. It wasn't one of the normal ones, oh no. It was one of his special snowflakes. That was nasty. He was taunting her. Now she could hate him. She'd never hated him before. But he was killing the lambs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She shivered and pulled the cloak around her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This I choose to do," she croaked, her breath leaving little clouds in the air. She cleared her throat and started again. "This I choose to do. If there is a price, this I choose to pay. If it is my death, then I choose to die. Where this takes me, there I choose to go. I choose. This I choose to do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't a spell, except in her own head, but if you couldn't make spells work in your own head, you couldn't make them work at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany wrapped her cloak around her against the clawing wind and watched dully as the men brought straw and wood. The fire started slowly, as if frightened to show enthusiasm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd done this before, hadn't she? Dozens of times. The trick was not that hard when you got the feel of it, but she'd done it with time to get her mind right, and anyway, she'd never done it with anything more than a kitchen fire to warm her freezing feet. In theory it should be just as easy with a big fire and a field of snow, right?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Right?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fire began to roar up. Her father put his hand on her shoulder. Tiffany jumped. She'd forgotten how quietly he could move.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What was that about choosing?" he said. She'd forgotten what good hearing he had, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's a…witch thing," she answered, trying not to look at his face. "So that if this…doesn't work, it's no one's fault but mine." And this is my fault, she added to herself. It's unfair, but no one said it wasn't going to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her father's hand caught her chin and gently turned her head around. How soft his hands are, Tiffany thought. Big man's hands but soft as a baby's, because of the grease on the sheep's fleeces.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We shouldn't have asked you, should we…" he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, you should have asked me, Tiffany thought. The lambs are dying under the dreadful snow. And I should have said no, I should have said I'm not that good yet. But the lambs are dying under the dreadful snow!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There will be other lambs, said her Second Thoughts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But these aren't those lambs, are they? These are the lambs that are dying, here and now. And they're dying because I listened to my feet and dared to dance with the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can do it," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her father held her chin and stared into her eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you sure, jiggit?" he asked. It was the nickname her grandmother had had for her—Granny Aching, who never lost a lamb to the dreadful snow. He'd never used it before. Why had it risen up in his mind now?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!" She pushed his hand away, and broke his gaze before she could burst into tears.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I…haven't told your mother this yet," said her father very slowly, as if the words required enormous care, "but I can't find your brother. I think he was trying to help. Abe Swindell said he saw him with his little shovel. Er…I'm sure he's all right, but…keep an eye open for him, will you? He's got his red coat on."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">His face, with no expression at all, was heartbreaking to see. Little Wentworth, nearly seven years old, always running after the men, always wanting to be one of them, always trying to help…how easily a small body could get overlooked…. The snow was still coming fast. The horribly wrong snowflakes were white on her father's shoulders. It's these little things you remember when the bottom falls out of the world, and you're falling—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That wasn't just unfair; that was…cruel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember the hat you wear! Remember the job that is in front of you! Balance! Balance is the thing. Hold balance in the center, hold the balance….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany extended her numb hands to the fire, to draw out the warmth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Remember, don't let the fire go out," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've got men bringing up wood from all over," said her father. "I told 'em to bring all the coal from the forge, too. It won't run out of feeding, I promise you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The flame danced and curved toward Tiffany's hands. The trick was, the trick, the trick…was to fold the heat somewhere close, draw it with you and…balance. Forget everything else!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll come with—" her father began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! Watch the fire!" Tiffany shouted, too loud, frantic with fear. "You will do what I say!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I am not your daughter today! her mind screamed. I am your witch! I will protect you!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She turned before he could see her face and ran through the flakes, along the track that had been cut toward the lower paddocks. The snow had been trodden down into a lumpy, hummocky path, made slippery with fresh snow. Exhausted men with shovels pressed themselves into the snowbanks on either side rather than get in her way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She reached the wider area where other shepherds were digging into the wall of snow. It tumbled in lumps around them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Stop! Get back!" her voice shouted, while her mind wept.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The men obeyed quickly. The mouth that had given that order had a pointy hat above it. You didn't argue with that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember the heat, the heat, remember the heat, balance, balance…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was witching cut to the bone. No toys, no wands, no Boffo, no headology, no tricks. All that mattered was how good you were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But sometimes you had to trick yourself. She wasn't the Summer Lady and she wasn't Granny Weatherwax. She needed to give herself all the help she could.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She pulled the little silver horse out of her pocket. It was greasy and stained, and she'd meant to clean it, but there had been no time, no time….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Like a knight putting on his helmet, she fastened the silver chain around her neck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She should have practiced more. She should have listened to people. She should have listened to herself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She took a deep breath and held out her hands on either side of her, palms up. On her right hand a white scar glowed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Thunder on my right hand," she said. "Lightning in my left hand. Fire behind me. Frost in front of me."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She stepped forward until she was only a few inches away from the snowbank. She could feel its coldness already pulling the heat out of her. Well, so be it. She took a few deep breaths. This I choose to do….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Frost to fire," she whispered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the yard, the fire went white and roared like a furnace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The snow wall spluttered and then exploded into steam, sending chunks of snow into the air. Tiffany walked forward slowly. Snow pulled back from her hands like mist at sunrise. It melted in the heat of her, becoming a tunnel in the deep drift, fleeing from her, writhing around her in clouds of cold fog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes! She smiled desperately. It was true. If you had the perfect center, if you got your mind right, you could balance. In the middle of the seesaw is a place that never moves….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her boots squelched over warm water. There was fresh green grass under the snow, because the awful storm had been so late in the year. She walked on, heading to where the lambing pens were buried.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her father stared at the fire. It was burning white-hot, like a furnace, eating through the wood as if driven by a gale. It was collapsing into ashes in front of his eyes….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Water was pouring around Tiffany's boots now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes! But don't think about it! Hold the balance! More heat! Frost to fire!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a bleat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sheep could live under the snow, at least for a while. But as Granny Aching used to say, when the gods made sheep, they must've left their brains in their other coat. In a panic, and sheep were always just an inch from panicking, they'd trample their own lambs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now ewes and lambs appeared, steaming and bewildered as the snow melted around them, as if they were sculptures left behind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany moved on, staring straight ahead of her, only just aware of the excited cries of the men behind her. They were following her, pulling the ewes free, cradling the lambs….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her father yelled at the other men. Some of them were hacking at a farm cart, throwing the wood down into the white-hot flames. Others were dragging furniture up from the house. Wheels, tables, straw bales, chairs—the fire took everything, gulped it down, and roared for more. And there wasn't any more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No red coat. No red coat! Balance, balance. Tiffany waded on, water and sheep pouring past her. The tunnel ceiling fell in a splashing and slithering of slush. She ignored it. Fresh snowflakes fell down through the hole and boiled in the air above her head. She ignored that, too. And then, ahead of her…a glimpse of red.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Frost to fire! The snow fled, and there he was. She picked him up, held him close, sent some of her heat into him, felt him stir, whispered: "It weighed at least forty pounds! At least forty pounds!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wentworth coughed and opened his eyes. Tears falling like melting snow, she ran over to a shepherd and thrust the boy into his arms.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Take him to his mother! Do it now!" The man grabbed the boy and ran, frightened of her fierceness. Today she was their witch!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany turned back. There were more lambs to be saved.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her father's coat landed on the starving flames, glowed for a moment, then fell into gray ashes. The other men were ready; they grabbed the man as he went to jump after it and pulled him back, kicking and shouting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The flint cobbles had melted like butter. They spluttered for a moment, then froze.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fire went out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany Aching looked up, into the eyes of the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And up on the roof of the cart shed, the small voice belonging to Wee Dangerous Spike said, "Ach, crivens!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">All this hasn't happened yet. It might not happen at all. The future is always a bit wobbly. Any little thing, like the fall of a snowflake or the dropping of the wrong kind of spoon, can send it spinning off along a new path. Or perhaps not.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where it all began was last autumn, on the day with a cat in it….</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
    
    
     
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">This is Tiffany Aching, riding a broomstick through the mountain forests a hundred miles away. It's a very old broomstick, and she's flying it just above the ground; it's got two smaller broomsticks stuck on the back like training wheels, to stop it from tipping over. It belongs, appropriately, to a very old witch called Miss Treason, who's even worse at flying than Tiffany and is 113 years old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany is slightly more than one hundred years younger than that, taller than she was even a month ago, and not as certain of anything at all as she was a year ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She is training to be a witch. Witches usually wear black, but as far as she could tell, the only reason that witches wore black was that they'd always worn black. This did not seem a good enough reason, so she tended to wear blue or green. She didn't laugh with scorn at finery because she'd never seen any.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You couldn't escape the pointy hat, though. There was nothing magical about a pointy hat except that it said that the woman underneath it was a witch. People paid attention to a pointy hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even so, it was hard to be a witch in the village where you'd grown up. It was hard to be a witch to people who knew you as "Joe Aching's girl" and had seen you running around with only your undershirt on when you were two years old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Going away had helped. Most people Tiffany knew hadn't been more than ten miles away from the spot where they were born, so if you'd gone to mysterious foreign parts, that made you a bit mysterious, too. You came back slightly different. A witch needed to be different.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on magic of the zap!-glingle-glingle-glingle variety. There was no school and nothing that was exactly like a lesson. But it wasn't wise to try to learn witching all by yourself, especially if you had a natural talent. If you got it wrong, you could go from ignorant to cackling in a week….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When you got right down to it, it was all about cackling. No one ever talked about this, though. Witches said things like "You can never be too old, too skinny, or too warty," but they never mentioned the cackling. Not properly. They watched out for it, though, all the time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was all too easy to become a cackler. Most witches lived by themselves (cat optional) and might go for weeks without ever seeing another witch. In those times when people hated witches, they were often accused of talking to their cats. Of course they talked to their cats. After three weeks without an intelligent conversation that wasn't about cows, you'd talk to the wall. And that was an early sign of cackling.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Cackling," to a witch, didn't just mean nasty laughter. It meant your mind drifting away from its anchor. It meant you losing your grip. It meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people's problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time, each bit so small that you'd hardly notice it, until you thought that it was normal to stop washing and wear a kettle on your head. It meant you thinking that the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you better than them. It meant thinking that right and wrong were negotiable. And, in the end, it meant you "going to the dark," as the witches said. That was a bad road. At the end of that road were poisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What stopped this was the habit of visiting. Witches visited other witches all the time, sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup of tea and a bun. Partly this was for gossip, of course, because witches love gossip, especially if it's more exciting than truthful. But mostly it was to keep an eye on one another.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Today Tiffany was visiting Granny Weatherwax, who was in the opinion of most witches (including Granny herself) the most powerful witch in the mountains. It was all very polite. No one said, "Not gone bats, then?" or "Certainly not! I'm as sharp as a spoon!" They didn't need to. They understood what it was all about, so they talked of other things. But when she was in a mood, Granny Weatherwax could be hard work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She sat silently in her rocking chair. Some people are good at talking, but Granny Weatherwax was good at silence. She could sit so quiet and still that she faded. You forgot she was there. The room became empty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It upset people. It was probably meant to. But Tiffany had learned silence too, from Granny Aching, her real grandmother. Now she was learning that if you made yourself really quiet, you could become almost invisible.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax was an expert.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany thought of it as the I'm-not-here spell, if it was a spell. She reasoned that everyone had something inside them that told the world they were there. That was why you could often sense when someone was behind you, even if they were making no sound at all. You were receiving their I-am-here signal.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some people had a very strong one. They were the people who got served first in shops. Granny Weatherwax had an I-am-here signal that bounced off the mountains when she wanted it to; when she walked into a forest, all the wolves and bears ran out the other side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She could turn it off, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She was doing that now. Tiffany was having to concentrate to see her. Most of her mind was telling her that there was no one there at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, she thought, that's about enough of that. She coughed. Suddenly Granny Weatherwax had always been there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Miss Treason is very well," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A fine woman," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She has her funny ways," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We're none of us perfect," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's trying some new eyes," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's good."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They're a couple of ravens…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's just as well," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Better than the mouse she usually uses," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I expect they are."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a bit more of this, until Tiffany began to get annoyed at doing all the work. There was such a thing as common politeness, after all. Oh well, she knew what to do about it now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mrs. Earwig's written another book," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I heard," said Granny. The shadows in the room maybe grew a little darker.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, that explained the sulk. Even thinking about Mrs. Earwig made Granny Weatherwax angry. Mrs. Earwig was all wrong to Granny Weatherwax. She wasn't born locally, which was almost a crime to begin with. She wrote books, and Granny Weatherwax didn't trust books. And Mrs. Earwig (pronounced "Ah-wij," at least by Mrs. Earwig) believed in shiny wands and magical amulets and mystic runes and the power of the stars, while Granny Weatherwax believed in cups of tea, dry biscuits, washing every morning in cold water, and, well, she believed mostly in Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mrs. Earwig was popular among the younger witches, because if you did witchcraft her way, you could wear so much jewelry that you could barely walk. Granny Weatherwax wasn't popular with anyone much—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">—except when they needed her. When Death was standing by the cradle or the axe slipped in the woods and blood was soaking into the moss, you sent someone hurrying to the cold, gnarly little cottage in the clearing. When all hope was gone, you called for Granny Weatherwax, because she was the best.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And she always came. Always. But popular? No. Need is not the same as like. Granny Weatherwax was for when things were serious.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany did like her, though, in an odd kind of way. She thought Granny Weatherwax liked her, too. She let Tiffany call her Granny to her face, when all the other young witches had to call her Mistress Weatherwax. Sometimes Tiffany thought that if you were friendly to Granny Weatherwax, she tested you to see how friendly you would stay. Everything about Granny Weatherwax was a test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The new book is called First Flights in Witchcraft," she went on, watching the old witch carefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax smiled. That is, her mouth went up at the corners.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hah!" she said. "I've said it before and I'll say it again: You can't learn witchin' from books. Letice Earwig thinks you can become a witch by goin' shoppin'." She gave Tiffany a piercing look, as if she were making up her mind about something. Then she said: "An' I'll wager she don't know how to do this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She picked up her cup of hot tea, curling her hand around it. Then she reached out with her other hand and took Tiffany's hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ready?" said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"For wha—" Tiffany began, and then she felt her hand get hot. The heat spread up her arm, warming it to the bone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Feelin' it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The warmth died away. And Granny Weatherwax, still watching Tiffany's face, turned the teacup upside down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The tea dropped out in one lump. It was frozen solid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany was old enough not to say, "How did you do that?" Granny Weatherwax didn't answer silly questions or, for that matter, many questions at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You moved the heat," Tiffany said. "You took the heat out of the tea and moved it through you to me, yes?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, but it never touched me," said Granny triumphantly. "It's all about balance, do you see? Balance is the trick. Keep the balance and—" She stopped. "You've ridden on a seesaw? One end goes up, one end goes down. But the bit in the middle, right in the middle, that stays where it is. Upness and downness go right through it. Don't matter how high or low the ends go, it keeps the balance." She sniffed. "Magic is mostly movin' stuff around."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Can I learn that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I daresay. It's not hard, if you get your mind right."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Can you teach me?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I just have. I showed you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, Granny, you just showed me how to do it, not…how to do it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Can't tell you that. I know how I do it. How you do it'll be different. You've just got to get your mind right."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How do I do that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How should I know? It's your mind," snapped Granny. "Put the kettle on again, will you? My tea's gone cold."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was something almost spiteful about all this, but that was Granny. She took the view that if you were capable of learning, you'd work it out. There was no point in making it easy for people. Life wasn't easy, she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' I see you're still wearing that trinket," said Granny. She didn't like trinkets, a word she used to mean anything metal a witch wore that wasn't there to hold up, shut, or fasten. That was "shoppin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany touched the little silver horse she wore around her neck. It was small and simple, and it meant a lot to her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes," she said calmly. "I still am."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What have you got in that basket?" Granny said now, which was unusually rude. Tiffany's basket was on the table. It had a present in it, of course. Everyone knew you took a small present along when you went visiting, but the person you were visiting was supposed to be surprised when you gave it to her, and say things like "Oooh, you shouldn't have."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I brought you something," said Tiffany, swinging the big black kettle onto the fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You've got no call to be bringing me presents, I'm sure," said Granny sternly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, well," said Tiffany, and left it at that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She heard Granny lift the lid of the basket. There was a kitten in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Her mother is Pinky, the Widow Cable's cat," said Tiffany, to fill the silence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You shouldn't have," growled the voice of Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It was no trouble." Tiffany smiled at the fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can't be havin' with cats."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She'll keep the mice down," said Tiffany, still not turning around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't have mice."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nothing for them to eat, thought Tiffany. Aloud, she said, "Mrs. Earwig's got six big black cats." In the basket, the white kitten would be staring up at Granny Weatherwax with the sad, shocked expression of all kittens. You test me, I test you, Tiffany thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know what I shall do with it, I'm sure. It'll have to sleep in the goat shed," said Granny Weatherwax. Most witches had goats.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The kitten rubbed against Granny's hand and went meep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When Tiffany left, later on, Granny Weatherwax said good-bye at the door and very carefully shut the kitten outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany went across the clearing to where she'd tied up Miss Treason's broomstick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But she didn't get on, not yet. She stepped back up against a holly bush, and went quiet until she wasn't there anymore, until everything about her said: I'm not here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Everyone could see pictures in the fire and in clouds. You just turned that the other way around. You turned off that bit of yourself that said you were there. You dissolved. Anyone looking at you would find you very hard to see. Your face became a bit of leaf and shadow, your body a piece of tree and bush. The other person's mind would fill in the gaps.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Looking like just another piece of holly bush, she watched the door. The wind had got up, warm but worrisome, shaking the yellow and red leaves off the sycamore trees and whirring them around the clearing. The kitten tried to bat a few of them out of the air and then sat there, making sad little mewling noises. Any minute now, Granny Weatherwax would think Tiffany had gone and would open the door and—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Forgot something?" said Granny by her ear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She was the bush.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…it's very sweet. I just thought you might, you know, grow to like it," said Tiffany, but she was thinking: Well, she could have got here if she ran, but why didn't I see her? Can you run and hide at the same time?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Never you mind about me, my girl," said the witch. "You run along back to Miss Treason and give her my best wishes, right now. But"—and her voice softened a little—"that was good hiding you did just then. There's many as would not have seen you. Why, I hardly heard your hair growin'!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When Tiffany's stick had left the clearing, and Granny Weatherwax had satisfied herself in other little ways that she had really gone, she went back inside, carefully ignoring the kitten again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a few minutes, the door creaked open a little. It may have been just a draft. The kitten trotted inside….</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">All witches were a bit odd. Tiffany had got used to odd, so that odd seemed quite normal. There was Miss Level, for example, who had two bodies, although one of them was imaginary. Mistress Pullunder, who bred pedigreed earthworms and gave them all names…well, she was hardly odd at all, just a bit peculiar, and anyway earthworms were quite interesting in a basically uninteresting kind of way. And there had been Old Mother Dismass, who suffered from bouts of temporal confusion, which can be quite strange when it happens to a witch; her mouth never moved in time with her words, and sometimes her footsteps came down the stairs ten minutes before she did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But when it came to odd, Miss Treason didn't just take the cake, but a packet of biscuits too, with sprinkles on the top, and also a candle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where to start, when things were wall-to-wall odd….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Eumenides Treason had gone blind when she was sixty years old. To most people that would have been a misfortune, but Miss Treason was skilled at Borrowing, a particular witch talent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She could use the eyes of animals, reading what they saw right out of their minds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd gone deaf when she was seventy-five, but she'd got the hang of it by now and used any ears she could find running around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When Tiffany had first gone to stay with her, Miss Treason had used a mouse for seeing and hearing, because her old jackdaw had died. It was a bit worrying to see an old woman striding around the cottage with a mouse in her outstretched hand, and very worrying if you said something and the mouse was swung around to face you. It was amazing how creepy a little pink wriggly nose could be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The new ravens were a lot better. Somebody in one of the local villages had made the old woman a perch that fitted across her shoulders, one bird on either side, and with her long white hair the effect was very, well, witchy, although a bit messy down the back of her cloak by the end of the day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then there was her clock. It was heavy and made of rusty iron by someone who was more blacksmith than watchmaker, which was why it went clonk-clank instead of tick-tock. She wore it on her belt and could tell the time by feeling the stubby little hands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a story in the villages that the clock was Miss Treason's heart, which she'd used ever since her first heart died. But there were lots of stories about Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You had to have a high threshold for odd to put up with her. It was traditional that young witches traveled around and stayed with older witches to learn from a lot of experts in exchange for what Miss Tick the witch finder called "some help with the chores," which meant "doing all the chores." Mostly, they left Miss Treason's after one night. Tiffany had stuck it out for three months so far.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, and sometimes, when she was looking for a pair of eyes to look through, Miss Treason would creep into yours. It was a strange prickly sensation, like having someone invisible looking over your shoulder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes…perhaps Miss Treason didn't just take the cake, a packet of biscuits with sprinkles on the top, and a candle, but also the trifle, the sandwiches, and a man who made amusing balloon animals afterward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She was weaving at her loom when Tiffany came in. Two beaks turned to face her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, child," said Miss Treason in a thin, cracked voice. "You have had a good day."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, Miss Treason," said Tiffany obediently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You have seen the girl Weatherwax and she is well." Click-clack went the loom. Clonk-clank went the clock.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Quite well," said Tiffany. Miss Treason didn't ask questions. She just told you the answers. "The girl Weatherwax," Tiffany thought, as she started to get their supper. But Miss Treason was very old.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And very scary. It was a fact. You couldn't deny it. She didn't have a hooked nose and she did have all her teeth, even if they were yellow, but after that she was a picture-book wicked witch. And her knees clicked when she walked. And she walked very fast, with the help of two sticks, scuttling around like a big spider. That was another strange thing: The cottage was full of cobwebs, which Miss Treason ordered Tiffany never to touch, but you never saw a spider.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was the thing about black, too. Most witches liked black, but Miss Treason even had black goats and black chickens. The walls were black. The floor was black. If you dropped a stick of licorice, you'd never find it again. And, to Tiffany's dismay, she had to make her cheeses black, which meant painting the cheeses with shiny black wax. Tiffany was an excellent cheesemaker and it did keep them moist, but Tiffany distrusted black cheeses. They always looked as though they were plotting something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Miss Treason didn't seem to need sleep. She hadn't got much use for night and day now. When the ravens went to bed, she'd summon up an owl and weave by owl sight. An owl was particularly good, she said, because it'd keep turning its head to watch the shuttle of the loom. Click-clack went the loom, and clonk-clank went the clock, right back at it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason, with her billowing black cloak and bandaged eyes and wild white hair…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason with her two sticks, wandering the cottage and garden in the dark and frosty night, smelling the memory of flowers….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All witches had some particular skill, and Miss Treason delivered Justice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People would come from miles around to bring her their problems:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know it's my cow but he says it's his!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She says it's her land but my father left it to me!…and Miss Treason would sit at the click-clacking loom with her back to the room full of anxious people. The loom worried them. They watched it as though they were afraid of it, and the ravens watched them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They would stutter out their cases, um-ing and ah-ing, while the loom rattled away in the flickering candlelight. Oh, yes…the candlelight…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The candleholders were two skulls. One had the word ENOCHI carved on it; the other had the word ATHOOTITA.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(The words meant "GUILT" and "INNOCENCE." Tiffany wished she didn't know that. There was no way that a girl brought up on the Chalk should know that, because the words were in a foreign language, and an ancient one, too. She knew them because of Dr. Sensibility Bustle, D. M. Phil., B. El L., Patricius Professor of Magic at Unseen 
        University, who was in her head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(Well, a tiny part of him, at least.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">(A couple of summers ago she had been taken over by a hiver, a…thing that had been collecting minds for millions of years. Tiffany managed to get it out of her head, but a few fragments had stayed tangled up in her brain. One of these was a tiny lump of ego and a mix of memories that were what remained of the late Dr. Bustle. He wasn't much trouble, but if she looked at anything in a foreign language, she could read it—or, rather, hear Dr. Bustle's reedy voice translating it for her. That seemed to be about all that was left of him, but she tried to avoid getting undressed in front of a mirror.)</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The candles had dripped wax all over the skulls, and people would keep glancing at them the whole time they were in the room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then, when all the words had been said, the loom would stop with a shock of sudden silence, and Miss Treason would turn around in her big heavy chair, which had wheels on it, and remove the black blindfold from her pearly gray eyes and say:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have heard. Now I shall see. I shall see what is true."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some people would actually run away at this point, when she stared at them in the light from the skulls. Those eyes that could not see your face could somehow see your mind. When Miss Treason was looking right through you, you could only be truthful or very, very stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So no one ever argued with Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Witches were not allowed to be paid for using their talents, but everyone who came to have a dispute settled by Miss Treason brought her a present, usually food but sometimes clean used clothing, if it was black, or a pair of old boots if they were her size. If Miss Treason gave judgment against you, it was really not a good idea (everyone said) to ask for your present back, as being turned into something small and sticky often offends.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They said if you lied to Miss Treason, you would die horribly within a week. They said that kings and princes came to see Miss Treason at night, asking questions about great affairs of state. They said that in her cellar was a heap of gold, guarded by a demon with skin like fire and three heads that would attack anyone it saw and eat their noses.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany suspected that at least two of these beliefs were wrong. She knew the third one wasn't true, because one day she'd gone down into the cellar (with a bucket of water and a poker, just in case), and there was nothing there but piles of potatoes and carrots. And a mouse, watching her carefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany wasn't scared, much. For one thing, unless the demon was good at disguising itself as a potato, it probably didn't exist. And another thing was that although Miss Treason looked bad and sounded bad and smelled like old locked wardrobes, she didn't feel bad.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First Sight and Second Thoughts, that's what a witch had to rely on: First Sight to see what's really there, and Second Thoughts to watch the First Thoughts to check that they were thinking right. Then there were the Third Thoughts, which Tiffany had never heard discussed and therefore kept quiet about; they were odd, seemed to think for themselves, and didn't turn up very often. And they were telling her that there was more to Miss Treason than met the eye.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then one day, when she was dusting, Tiffany knocked over the skull called Enochi.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…and suddenly Tiffany knew a lot more about Miss Treason than Miss Treason probably wanted anyone to know.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tonight, as they were eating their stew (with black beans), Miss Treason said, "The wind is rising. We must go soon. I would not trust the stick above the trees on a night like this. There may be strange creatures about."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Go? We're going out?" Tiffany asked. They never went out in the evenings, which was why the evenings always felt a hundred years long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Indeed we are. They will be dancing tonight."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who will?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The ravens will not be able to see and the owl will get confused," Miss Treason went on. "I will need to use your eyes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who will be dancing, Miss Treason?" said Tiffany. She liked dancing, but no one seemed to dance up here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It is not far, but there will be a storm."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So that was that; Miss Treason wasn't going to tell. But it sounded interesting. Besides, it would probably be an education to see anyone Miss Treason thought was strange.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course, it did mean Miss Treason would put her pointy hat on. Tiffany hated this bit. She'd have to stand in front of Miss Treason and stare at her, and feel the little tingle in her eyes as the ancient witch used her as a kind of mirror.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wind was roaring in the woods like a big dark animal by the time they'd finished supper. It barged the door out of Tiffany's hands when she opened it and blew around the room, making the cords hum on the loom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you sure about this, Miss Treason?" she said, trying to push the door shut.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't you say that to me! You will not say that to me! The dance must be witnessed! I have never missed the dance!" Miss Treason looked nervous and edgy. "We must go! And you must wear black."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Miss Treason, you know I don't wear black," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tonight is a night for black. You will wear my second-best cloak."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She said it with a witch's firmness, as if the idea of anyone disobeying had never crossed her mind. She was 113 years old. She'd had a lot of practice. Tiffany didn't argue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It isn't that I have anything against black, Tiffany thought as she fetched the second-best cloak, but it's just not me. When people say witches wear black, they actually mean that old ladies wear black. Anyway, it's not as if I'm wearing pink or something….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After that she had to wrap Miss Treason's clock in pieces of blanket, so that the clonk-clank became clonk-clank. There was no question of leaving it behind. Miss Treason always kept the clock close to her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While Tiffany got herself ready, the old woman wound the clock up with a horrible graunching noise. She was always winding it up; sometimes she stopped to do it in the middle of a judgment, with a room full of horrified people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no rain yet, but when they set out the air was full of twigs and flying leaves. Miss Treason sat sidesaddle on the broom, hanging on for dear life, while Tiffany walked along towing it by means of a piece of clothesline.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sunset sky was still red, and a gibbous moon was high, but the clouds were being whipped across it, filling the woods with moving shadows. Branches knocked together, and Tiffany heard the creak and crash as, somewhere in the dark, one fell to the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are we going to the villages?" Tiffany yelled above the din.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! Take the path through the forest!" shouted Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Ah, thought Tiffany, is this the famous "dancing around without your drawers on" that I've heard so much about? Actually, not very much about, because as soon as anyone mentions it, someone else tells them to shut up, so I really haven't heard much about it at all, but haven't heard in a very meaningful way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was something people thought witches did, but witches didn't think they did it. Tiffany had to admit she could see why. Even hot summer nights weren't all that warm, and there were always hedgehogs and thistles to worry about. Besides, you just couldn't imagine someone like Granny Weatherwax dancing around without—Well, you just couldn't imagine it, because if you did, it would make your head explode.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wind died down as she took the forest track, still towing the floating Miss Treason. But the wind had brought cold air with it and then left it behind. Tiffany was glad of the cloak, even if it was black.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She trudged on, taking different tracks when Miss Treason told her to, until she saw firelight through the trees, in a little dip in the land.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Stop here and help me down, girl," said the old witch. "And listen carefully. There are rules. One, you will not talk; two, you will look only at the dancers; three, you will not move until the dance is finished. I will not tell you twice!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, Miss Treason. It's very cold up here."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And will get colder."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They headed for the distant light. What good is a dance you can only watch? Tiffany wondered. It didn't sound like much fun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It isn't meant to be fun," said Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Shadows moved across the firelight, and Tiffany heard the sound of men's voices. Then, as they reached the edge of the sunken ground, someone threw water over the fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a hiss, and a cloud of smoke and steam rose among the trees. It happened in a moment and left a shock behind. The only thing that had seemed alive here had died.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dry fallen leaves crunched under her feet. The moon, in a sky swept clean now of clouds, made little silver shapes on the forest floor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was some time before Tiffany realized that there were six men standing in the middle of the clearing. They must have been wearing black; against the moonlight they looked like man-shaped holes into nothing. They were in two lines of three, facing each other, but were so still that after a while Tiffany wondered if she was imagining them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was the thud of a drumbeat: bom…bom…bom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It went on for half a minute or so, and then stopped. But in the silence of the cold woods the beat went on inside Tiffany's head, and perhaps that wasn't the only head it thundered in, because the men were gently nodding their heads, to keep the beat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They began to dance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only noise was of their boots hitting the ground as the shadow men wove in and out. But then Tiffany, her head full of the silent drum, heard another sound. Her foot was tapping, all by itself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd heard this beat before; she'd seen men dancing like this. But it had been on warm days in bright sunshine. They'd worn little bells on their clothes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This is a Morris dance!" she said, not quite under her breath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Shush!" hissed Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But this isn't the right—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Be silent!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blushing and angry in the dark, Tiffany took her eyes off the dancers and defiantly looked around the clearing. There were other shadows crowding in, human or at least human shaped, but she couldn't see them clearly and maybe that was just as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was getting colder, she was sure. White frost was crackling across the leaves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The beat went on. But it seemed to Tiffany that it wasn't alone now, but had picked up other beats, and echoes from inside her head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason could shush all she liked. It was a Morris dance. But it was out of time!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Morris men came to the village sometime in May. You could never be sure when, because they had to call at lots of villages along the Chalk, and every village had a pub, which slowed them down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They carried sticks and wore white clothes with bells on them, to stop them from creeping up on people. No one likes an unexpected Morris dancer. Tiffany would wait outside the village with the other children and dance behind them all the way in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then they used to dance on the village green to the beat of a drum, banging their sticks together in the air, and then everyone would go to the pub and summer would come.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany hadn't been able to work out how that last bit happened. The dancers danced, and then summer came—that was all anybody seemed to know. Her father said that there had once been a year when the dancers hadn't turned up, and a cold wet spring had turned into a chilly autumn, with the months between being filled with mists and rain and frosts in August.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sound of the drums filled her head now, making her feel dizzy. They were wrong; there was something wrong—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then she remembered the seventh dancer, the one they called the Fool. He was generally a small man, wearing a battered top hat and bright rags sewn all over his clothes. Mostly he wandered around holding out the hat and grinning at people until they gave him money for beer. But sometimes he'd put the hat down and whirl off into the dancers. You'd expect there to be a massive collision of arms and legs, but it never happened. Jumping and twirling among the sweating men, he always managed to be where the other dancers weren't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The world was moving around her. She blinked. The drums in her head were like thunder now, and there was one beat as deep as oceans. Miss Treason was forgotten. So was the strange, mysterious crowd. Now there was only the dance itself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It twisted in the air like a living thing. But there was a space in it, moving around. It was where she should be, she knew it. Miss Treason had said no, but that had been a long time ago and how could Miss Treason understand? What could she know? When did she last dance? The dance was in Tiffany's bones now, calling to her. Six dancers were not enough!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She ran forward and jumped into the dance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The eyes of the dancing men glared at her as she skipped and danced between them, always being where they weren't. The drums had her feet, and they went where the beat sent them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then……there was someone else there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was like the feeling of someone behind her—but it was also the feeling of someone in front of her, and beside her, and above her, and below her, all at once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The dancers froze, but the world spun. The men were just black shadows, darker outlines in the darkness. The drumbeats stopped, and there was one long moment as Tiffany turned gently and silently, arms out, feet not touching the ground, her face turned toward stars that were as cold as ice and sharp as needles. It felt…wonderful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A voice said: "Who Are You?" It had an echo, or perhaps two people had said it at almost the same time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The beat came back, suddenly, and six men crashed into her.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A few hours later, in the small town of Dogbend, down on the plains, the citizens threw a witch into the river with her arms and legs tied together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This sort of thing never happened in the mountains, where witches had respect, but down on the wide plains there were still people dumb enough to believe the nastier stories. Besides, there wasn't much to do in the evenings.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">However, it probably wasn't often that the witch was given a cup of tea and some biscuits before her ducking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It had happened here because the people of Dogbend Did It By The Book.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The book was called: Magavenatio Obtusis.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">It is not good, being in a sandwich of bewildered dancers. They were heavy men. Tiffany was Aching all over. She was covered in bruises, including one the shape of a boot that she wasn't going to show to anyone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Feegles filled every flat surface in Miss Treason's weaving room. She was working at her loom with her back to the room because, she said, this helped her think; but since she was Miss Treason, her position didn't matter much. There were plenty of eyes and ears she could use, after all. The fire burned hot, and there were candles everywhere. Black ones, of course.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany was angry. Miss Treason hadn't shouted, hadn't even raised her voice. She'd just sighed and said "foolish child," which was a whole lot worse, mostly because that's just what Tiffany knew she'd been. One of the dancers had helped bring her back to the cottage. She couldn't remember anything about that at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A witch didn't do things because they seemed a good idea at the time! That was practically cackling! You had to deal every day with people who were foolish and lazy and untruthful and downright unpleasant, and you could certainly end up thinking that the world would be considerably improved if you gave them a slap. But you didn't because, as Miss Tick had once explained: a) it would make the world a better place for only a very short time; b) it would then make the world a slightly worse place; and c) you're not supposed to be as stupid as they are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her feet had moved, and she'd listened to them. She ought to have been listening to her head. Now she had to sit by Miss Treason's fire with a tin hot-water bottle on her lap and a shawl around her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So the Wintersmith is a kind of god?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That kind o' thing, yes," said Billy Bigchin. "But not the prayin'-to kinda god. He just…makes winters. It's his job, ye ken."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's an elemental," said Miss Treason from her loom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye," said Rob Anybody. "Gods, elementals, demons, spirits…sometimes it's hard to tell 'em apart wi'oot a map."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the dance is to welcome winter?" said Tiffany. "That doesn't make sense! The Morris dance is to welcome the coming of the summer, yes, that's—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you an infant?" said Miss Treason. "The year is round! The wheel of the world must spin! That is why up here they dance the Dark Morris, to balance it. They welcome the winter because of the new summer deep inside it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Click-clack went the loom. Miss Treason was weaving a new cloth, of brown wool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, all right," said Tiffany. "We welcomed it…him. That doesn't mean he's supposed to come looking for me!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why did you join the dance?" Miss Treason demanded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…There was a space, and—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes. A space. A space not intended for you. Not for you, foolish child. You danced with him, and now he wants to meet such a bold girl. I have never heard of such a thing! I want you to fetch the third book from the right on the second shelf from the top of my bookcase." She handed Tiffany a heavy black key. "Can you manage to do even that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Witches didn't need to slap the stupid, not when they had a sharp tongue that was always ready.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason also had several shelves of books, which was unusual for one of the older witches. The shelves were high up, the books looked big and heavy, and up until now Miss Treason had forbidden Tiffany to dust them, let alone unlock the big black iron band that secured them to the shelves. People who came here always gave them a nervous look. Books were dangerous.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany unlocked the bands and wiped away the dust. Ah…the books were, like Miss Treason, not everything they seemed. They looked like magic books, but they had names like An Encyclopaedia of Soup. There was a dictionary. Next to it the book Miss Treason had asked for was covered in cobwebs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still blushing with shame and anger, Tiffany got the book down, fighting to get it free of the webs. Some of them went pling! as they snapped, and dust fell off the top of the pages. When she opened it, it smelled old and parchmenty, like Miss Treason. The title, in gold lettering that had almost rubbed away, was Chaffinch's Ancient and Classical Mythology. It was full of bookmarks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Pages eighteen and nineteen," said Miss Treason, her head not moving. Tiffany turned to them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"‘The Dacne of the Sneasos'?" she said. "Is that supposed to be ‘The Dance of the Seasons'?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Regrettably, the artist, Don Weizen de Yoyo, whose famous masterpiece that was, did not have the same talent with letters as he had with painting," said Miss Treason. "They worried him, for some reason. I notice you mention the words before the pictures. You are a bookish child."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The picture was…strange. It showed two figures. Tiffany hadn't seen masquerade costumes. There wasn't the money at home for that sort of thing. But she'd read about them, and this was pretty much what she'd imagined.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The page showed a man and a woman—or, at least, things that looked like a man and a woman. The woman was labeled "Summer" and was tall and blond and beautiful, and therefore to the short, brown-haired Tiffany was a figure of immediate distrust. She was carrying what looked like a big basket shaped like a shell, which was full of fruit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The man, "Winter," was old and bent and gray. Icicles glittered on his beard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, that's wha' the Wintersmith would look like, sure enough," said Rob Anybody, strolling across the page. "Ol' Frosty."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Him?" said Tiffany. "That's the Wintersmith? He looks a hundred years old!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A youngster, eh?" said Miss Treason nastily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Dinna let him kiss ye, or yer nose might turn blue and fall off!" said Daft Wullie cheerfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Daft Wullie, don't you dare say things like that!" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I wuz just tryin' to lighten the mood, ye ken," said Wullie, looking sheepish.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's an artist's impression, of course," said Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What does that mean?" said Tiffany, staring at the picture. It was wrong. She knew it. This wasn't what he was like at all….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It means he made it up," said Billy Bigchin. "He wouldna ha' seen him, noo, would he? No one's seen the Wintersmith."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yet!" said Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wullie," said Rob Anybody, turning to his brother, "ye ken I told ye aboot makin' tactful remarks?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, Rob, I ken weel," said Wullie obediently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What ye just said wuz not one o' them," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wullie hung his head. "Sorry, Rob."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany clenched her fists. "I didn't mean all this to happen!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason turned her chair with some solemnity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then what did you mean? Will you tell me? Did you dance out of youth's inclination to disobey old age? To mean is to think. Did you think at all? Others have joined in the dance before now. Children, drunkards, youths for a silly bet…nothing happened. The spring and autumn dances are…just an old tradition, most people would say. Just a way of marking when ice and fire exchange their dominion over the world. Some of us think we know better. We think something happens. For you, the dance became real, and something has happened. And now the Wintersmith is seeking you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why?" Tiffany managed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know. When you were dancing, did you see anything? Hear anything?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How could you describe the feeling of being everywhere and everything? Tiffany wondered. She didn't try.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I…thought I heard a voice, or maybe two voices," she mumbled. "Er, they asked me who I was."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Int-ter-rest-ting," said Miss Treason. "Two voices? I will consider the implications. What I can't understand is how he found you. I will think about that. In the meantime, I expect it would be a good idea to wear warm clothing."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye," said Rob Anybody, "the Wintersmith canna abide the heat. Oh, I'll be forgettin' my ain heid next! We brought a wee letter from that hollow tree down in the forest. Gi' it to the big wee hag, Wullie. We picked it up on the way past."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A letter?" said Tiffany, as the loom clacked behind her and Daft Wullie began to pull a grubby, rolled-up envelope from his spog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's from that wee heap o' jobbies at the castle back hame," Rob went on, as his brother hauled. "He says he bides fine and hopes ye do likewise, an' he's lookin' forward to you bein' back hame soon, an' there's lots o' stuff about how the ships are doin' an' suchlike, no' verra interestin' in ma opinion, an' he's writ S. W. A. L. K. on the bottom, but we havena worked out what that means yet."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You read my letter?" said Tiffany in horror.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye," said Rob with pride. "Nae problem. Billy Bigchin here gave me a wee hint with some o' the longer words, but it was mostly me, aye." He beamed, but the grin faded as he watched Tiffany's expression. "Ach, I ken you're a wee bitty upset that we opened yon envelope thingy," he explained. "But that's okay, 'cuz we glued it up again wi' slug. Ye wouldna ever know it'd been read."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He coughed, because Tiffany was still glaring at him. All women were a bit scary to the Feegles, and witches were the worst. At last, when he was really nervous, Tiffany said: "How did you know where that letter would be?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She glanced sideways at Daft Wullie. He was chewing the edge of his kilt. He only ever did this when he was frightened.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…would you accept a wee bittie lie?" Rob said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's interestin'. There's dragons an' unicorns in it—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. I want the truth!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, it's so boring. We go to the Baron's castle an' read the letters ye sent him, an', an' ye said the postman knows to leave letters tae you in the hollow tree by the waterfall," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If the Wintersmith had got into the cottage, the air couldn't have been any colder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He keeps the letters fra' ye in a box under his—" Rob began, and then shut his eyes as Tiffany's patience parted with a twang even louder than Miss Treason's strange cobwebs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't you know it's wrong to read other people's letters?" she demanded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…" Rob Anybody began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And you broke into the Baron's cast—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, ah, ah, no, no, no!" said Rob, jumping up and down. "Ye canna get us on that one! We just walked in through one of them little wee slits for the firin' o' the arrows—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And then you read my personal letters sent personally to Roland?" said Tiffany. "They were personal!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye," said Rob Anybody. "But dinna fash yersel'—we willna tell anyone what was in 'em."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We ne'er tell a soul what's in yer diary, after all," said Daft Wullie. "Not e'en the bits wi' the flowers ye draw aroound them."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason is grinning to herself behind me, Tiffany thought. I just know she is. But she'd run out of nasty tones of voice. You did that after talking to the Feegles for any length of time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You were their Kelda, her Second Thoughts reminded her. They think they have a solemn duty to protect you. It doesn't matter what you think. They're going to make your life sooo complicated.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't read my letters," she said, "and don't read my diary, either."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Okay," said Rob Anybody.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Promise?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But you promised last time!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Cross your heart and hope to die?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye, nae problemo."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And that's the promise of an untrustworthy, lying, stealing Feegle, is it?" said Miss Treason. "Because ye believe ye're deid already, do ye no'? That's what ye people think, right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye, mistress," said Rob Anybody. "Thank ye for drawin' ma attention tae that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"In fact, Rob Anybody, ye ha' nae intention o' keepin' any promise at all!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, mistress," said Rob proudly. "Not puir wee weak promises like that. Becuz, ye see, 'tis oor solemn destiny to guard the big wee hag. We mus' lay doon oor lives for her if it comes to it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How can ye do that when ye're deid already?" said Miss Treason sharply.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's a bit o' a puzzler, right enough," said Rob, "so probably we'll lay doon the lives o' any scunners who do wrong by her."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany gave up and sighed. "I'm almost thirteen," she said. "I can look after myself."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hark at Miss Self-Reliant," said Miss Treason, but not in a particularly nasty way. "Against the Wintersmith?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What does he want?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I told you. Perhaps he wants to find out what kind of girl was so forward as to dance with him?" said Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It was my feet! I said I didn't mean to!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason turned around in her chair. How many eyes is she using? Tiffany's Second Thoughts wondered. The Feegles? The ravens? The mice? All of them? How many of me is she seeing? Is she watching me with mice, or insects with dozens of glittery eyes?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, that's all right then," said Miss Treason. "Once again, you didn't mean it. A witch takes responsibility! Have you learned nothing, child?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Child. That was a terrible thing to say to anyone who was almost thirteen. Tiffany felt herself going red again. The horrible hotness spread inside her head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was why she walked across the room, opened the front door, and stepped outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A fluffy snow was falling, very gently. When Tiffany looked into the pale-gray sky, she saw the flakes drifting down in soft, feathery clusters; it was the kind of snow that people back home on the Chalk called "Granny Aching shearing her sheep."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany felt the flakes melting on her hair as she walked away from the cottage. Miss Treason was shouting from the doorway, but she walked on, letting the snow cool her blushes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Of course this is stupid, she told herself. But being a witch is stupid. Why do we do it? It's hard work for not much reward. What's a good day for Miss Treason? When someone brings her a secondhand pair of old boots that fit properly! What does she know about anything?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where is the Wintersmith, then? Is he here? I've only got Miss Treason's word for it! That and a made-up picture in a book!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wintersmith!" she shouted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You could hear the snow falling. It made a strange little noise, like a faint, cold sizzle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wintersmith!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no reply.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, what had she expected? A big booming voice? Mr. Spiky the icicle man? There was nothing but the softness of white snow falling patiently among dark trees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She felt a bit silly now, but satisfied, too. This was what a witch did! She faced what she was afraid of, and then it held no more fear! She was good at this!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She turned—and saw the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Remember this, said her Third Thoughts, cutting in. Every little detail is important.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith was……nothing. But the snow outlined him. It flowed around him in lines, as if traveling on an invisible skin. He was just a shape, and nothing more, except perhaps for two tiny pale purple-gray dots in the air, where you might expect to find eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany stood still, her mind frozen, her body waiting to be told what to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hand made of falling snow was reaching toward her now, but very slowly, as you would reach out toward an animal you do not want to frighten. There was…something, some strange sense of things unsaid because there was no voice to say them, a sense of striving, as if the thing were putting heart and soul into this moment, even if it did not know the meaning of heart or soul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The hand stopped about a foot away from her. It was formed into a fist, and now it turned over and the fingers opened.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something gleamed. It was the white horse, made of silver, on a fine silver chain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's hand flew to her throat. But she'd had it on last night! Before she went…to…watch…the…dance….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It must have come off! And he'd found it!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's interesting, said her Third Thoughts that busied themselves with the world in their own way. You can't see what's hidden inside an invisible fist. How does that work? And why are those little purple-gray blurs in the air where you'd expect to find eyes? Why aren't they invisible?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's Third Thoughts for you. When a huge rock is going to land on your head, they're the thoughts that think: Is that an igneous rock, such as granite, or is it sandstone?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That part of Tiffany's brain that was a little less precise at the moment watched the silver horse dangle on its chain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her First Thought was: Take it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her Second Thought was: Don't take it. It's a trap.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her Third Thought was: Really don't take it. It will be colder than you can imagine.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the rest of her overruled the Thoughts entirely and said: Take it. It's part of who you are. Take it. When you hold it, you think of home. Take it!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She held out her right hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The horse dropped into it. Instinctively she closed her fingers over it. It was indeed colder than she could have imagined, and it burned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She screamed. The Wintersmith's snowy outline became a flurry of flakes. The snow around her feet erupted with a cry of "Crivens!" as a mass of Feegles grabbed her feet and carried her, upright, across the clearing and back in through the cottage's doorway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany forced her hand open and, with trembling fingers, pulled the silver horse off her palm. It left a perfect print, a white horse on pink flesh. It wasn't a burn, it was a…freeze.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason's chair rumbled around on its wheels.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Come here, child," she ordered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still clasping her hand, trying to force back the tears, Tiffany walked over to her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Stand right here by my chair, this instant!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany did so. This was no time to be disobedient.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I wish to look in your ear," said Miss Treason. "Brush your hair aside."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany held back her hair, and winced when she heard the tickle of mouse whiskers. Then the creature was taken away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, I am surprised," said Miss Treason. "I can see nothing."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…what were you expecting to see?" Tiffany ventured.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Daylight!" snapped Miss Treason, so loudly that the mouse scuttled away. "Have you no brains at all, child?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah dunno if anyone is interested," said Rob Anybody, "but I think yon Wintersmith has offskied. An' it's stopped snowin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one was listening. When witches row, they concentrate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It was mine!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A trinket!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"O' course, this may not be the best time tae tell ye…" Rob went on, miserably.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You think you need it to be a witch?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A witch needs no devices!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You've used shambles!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Used, yes! Don't need. Not need!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah mean, it's quite meltin' awa—" Rob said, smiling nervously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anger grabbed Tiffany's tongue. How dare this stupid old crone talk about not needing things!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Boffo!" she shouted. "Boffo, Boffo, Boffo!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Silence slammed down. After a while Miss Treason looked past Tiffany and said: "Ye wee Feegle schemies! Get oot o' here right noo! Ah'll ken it if ye don't! This is hag business!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The room filled with a sort of whooshing noise, and the door to the kitchen slammed shut.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So," said Miss Treason, "you know about Boffo, do you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes," said Tiffany, breathing heavily. "I do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Very well. And have you told anyone—?" Miss Treason paused and raised a finger to her lips. Then she banged a stick on the floor. "Ah said get oot, ye scunners! Off intae the woods w' ye! Check that he's really gang awa'! I'll see yer guilt through yer own een if ye defy me!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From below there was the sound of a lot of potatoes rumbling as the Feegles scrambled out through the little ventilation grill.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Now they've gone," said Miss Treason. "They'll stay gone, too. Boffo will see to that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Somehow, in the space of a few seconds, Miss Treason had become more human and a lot less scary. Well…slightly less scary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How did you find out? Did you go looking for it? Did you go prowling and rummaging?" said Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! I'm not like that! I found out by accident one day when you were having a nap!" Tiffany rubbed her hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Does that hurt a lot?" said Miss Treason, leaning forward. She might be blind, but—like all the senior witches who knew what they were doing—she noticed everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, not now. It did, though. Look, I—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then you will learn to listen! Do you think the Wintersmith has gone?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He just seemed to vanish—I mean, vanish even more. I think he just wanted to give me back my necklace."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do you think that is the sort of thing the spirit of Winter, who commands the blizzard and the frost, would really do?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know, Miss Treason! He's the only one I've met!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You danced with him."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I didn't know I was going to!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nevertheless."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany waited, and then said: "Nevertheless what?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Just general neverthelessness. The little horse led him to you. But he's not here now—you're right about that. I'd know if he was."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany walked up to the front door, hesitated for just a moment, and then opened it and went out into the clearing. There was a bit of snow here and there, but the day was turning into just another one of those gray-skyed winter days.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd know if he was, too, she thought. And he isn't. And her Second Thoughts said: Oh? How do you know?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We've both touched the horse," she said under her breath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She looked around at the empty branches and the sleeping trees, fiddling with the silver chain in her hand. The forests were curling in on themselves, ready for the winter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He's out there, but not close. He must be very busy, with a whole winter to make….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She said, "Thank you!" automatically, because her mother had always said that politeness costs nothing, and went back in. It was very hot inside now, but Miss Treason always had a huge log pile built by the Secret of Boffo. The local woodcutters always kept the pile high. A chilly witch might get nasty.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I should like a cup of black tea," said the old woman as Tiffany walked in, looking thoughtful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She waited until Tiffany was washing out the cup, then said: "Have you heard the stories about me, child?" The voice was kindly. There had been shouts, there had been things said that might have been better put, there had been temper and defiance. But they were there together, with nowhere else to go. The quiet voice was a peace offering, and Tiffany was glad of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er, that you have a demon in the cellar?" Tiffany answered, her mind still full of puzzles. "And you eat spiders? And get visited by kings and princes? And that any flower planted in your garden blooms black?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, do they say so?" said Miss Treason, looking delighted. "I haven't heard that last one. How nice. And did you hear that I walk around at night in the dark time of the year and reward those who have been good citizens with a purse of silver? But if they have been bad, I slit open their bellies with my thumbnail like this?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany leaped backward as a wrinkled hand twisted her around and Miss Treason's yellow thumbnail scythed past her stomach. The old woman looked terrifying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! No, I haven't heard that one!" she gasped, pressing up against the sink.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What? And it was a wonderful story, with real historical antecedents!" said Miss Treason, her vicious scowl becoming a smile. "And the one about me having a cow's tail?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A cow's tail? No!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really? How very vexing," said Miss Treason, lowering her finger. "I fear the art of storytelling has got into a pretty bad way in these parts. I really shall have to do something."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This is just another kind of Boffo, right?" said Tiffany. She wasn't totally sure. Miss Treason had looked pretty scary with that thumbnail. No wonder girls left so quickly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, you do have a brain, after all. Of course it is. Boffo, yes. A good name for it. Boffo, indeed. The art of expectations. Show people what they want to see, show 'em what they think should be there. I have a reputation to keep up, after all."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Boffo, Tiffany thought. Boffo, Boffo, Boffo.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She went over to the skulls, picked one up, and read the label underneath, just like she'd done a month ago:</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Ghastly Skull No. 1 Price $2.99</div>
        
       
       

      <div class="paragraph">The Boffo Novelty &amp; Joke Shop</div>
        
       
       

      <div class="paragraph">No. 4, Tenth Egg Street, Ankh-Morpork</div>
        
       
       

      <div class="paragraph">"If it's a laugh…it's a Boffo!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">"Very lifelike, aren't they," said Miss Treason, clicking back to her chair, "if you can say that about a skull, of course! The shop sold a wonderful machine for making spiderwebs. You poured in this sticky stuff, d'you see, and with practice quite good webs could be made. Can't abide creepy-crawlies, but of course I've got to have the webs. Did you notice the dead flies?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes," said Tiffany, glancing up. "They're raisins. I thought you had vegetarian spiders."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well done. Nothing wrong with your eyes, at least. I got my hat from there, too. ‘Wicked Old Witch Number Three, A Must for Scary Parties,' I think it was. I've still got their catalogue somewhere, if you're interested."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do all witches buy from Boffo?" asked Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Only me, at least around here. Oh, and I believe Old Mistress Breathless over in Two Falls used to buy warts from there."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But…why?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She couldn't grow them. Just couldn't grow them at all, poor woman. Tried everything. Face like a baby's bottom, her whole life."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, I meant, why do you want to seem so"—Tiffany hesitated, and went on—"awful?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have my reasons," said Miss Treason.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But you don't do those things the stories say you do, do you? Kings and princes don't come to consult you, do they?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, but they might," said Miss Treason stoutly. "If they got lost, for example. Oh, I know all about those stories. I made up most of them!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You made up stories about yourself?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes. Of course. Why not? I couldn't leave something as important as that to amateurs."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But people say you can see a man's soul!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason chuckled. "Yes. Didn't make that one up! But I'll tell you, for some of my parishioners I'd need a magnifying glass! I see what they see, I hear with their ears. I knew their fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers. I know the rumors and the secrets and the stories and the truths. And I am Justice to them, and I am fair. Look at me. See me."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany looked—and looked past the black cloak and the skulls and the rubber cobwebs and the black flowers and the blindfold and the stories, and saw a little deaf and blind old lady.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Boffo made the difference…not just the silly party stuff, but Boffo-thinking—the rumors and the stories. Miss Treason had power because people thought she did. It was like the standard witch's hat. But Miss Treason was taking Boffo much, much further.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A witch needs no devices, Miss Treason," Tiffany said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't get smart with me, child. Didn't the girl Weatherwax tell you all this? Oh, yes, you don't need a wand or a shamble or even a pointy hat to be a witch. But it helps a witch to put on a show! People expect it. They'll believe in you. I didn't get where I am today by wearing a woolly bobble hat and a gingham apron! I look the part. I—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a crash from outside, in the direction of the dairy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Our little blue friends?" said Miss Treason, raising her eyebrows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, they're absolutely forbidden to go into any dairy I work in," Tiffany began, heading for the door. "Oh dear, I hope it's not Horace—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I told you he'd be nothing but trouble, did I not?" Miss Treason shouted as Tiffany hurried away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was Horace. He'd squeezed out of his cage again. He could make himself quite runny when he wanted to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a broken butter dish on the floor, but although it had been full of butter, there was none there now. There was just a greasy patch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And, from the darkness under the sink, there came a sort of high-speed grumbling noise, a kind of mnnamnamnam….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, you're after butter now, are you, Horace?" said Tiffany, picking up the dairy broom. "That's practically cannibalism, you know."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still, it was better than mice, she had to admit. Finding little piles of mouse bones on the floor was a bit distressing. Even Miss Treason had not been able to work that one out. A mouse she happened to be looking through would be trying to get at the cheeses and then it would all go dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was because Horace was a cheese.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany knew that Lancre Blue cheeses were always a bit on the lively side, and sometimes had to be nailed down, but…well, she was highly skilled at cheese making, even though she said it herself, and Horace was definitely a champion. The famous blue streaks that gave the variety its wonderful color were really pretty, although Tiffany wasn't sure they should glow in the dark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She prodded the shadows with the end of the broom. There was a crack, and when she pulled the stick out again, two inches were missing from the end. Then there was a ptooi! noise and the missing piece of handle bounced off the wall on the other side of the room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No more milk for you, then," said Tiffany, straightening up, and she thought:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He came to give me the horse back. The Wintersmith did that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Um…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That is quite…impressive, when you think about it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I mean, he's got to organize avalanches and gales and come up with new shapes for snowflakes and everything, but he spared a bit of time just to come and give me my necklace back. Um…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And he just stood there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then he just vanished—I mean vanished even more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Um…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She left Horace muttering under the sink and made tea for Miss Treason, who was back at her weaving. Then she quietly went up to her room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's diary was three inches thick. Annagramma, another local trainee witch and one of her friends (more or less), said that she should really call it her Book of Shadows and write it on vellum using one of the special magical inks sold at Zakzak Stronginthearm's Magical Emporium at Popular Prices—at least, prices that were popular with Zakzak.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany couldn't afford one. You could only trade witchcraft—you weren't supposed to sell it. Miss Treason didn't mind her selling cheeses, but even so paper was expensive up here, and the wandering peddlers never had very much to sell. They usually had an ounce or two of green copperas, though, which could make a decent ink if you mixed it with crushed oak galls or green walnut shells.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The diary was now as thick as a brick with extra pages Tiffany had glued in. She'd worked out that she could make it last two more years if she wrote small.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the leather cover she had, with a hot skewer, drawn the words "Feegles Keep Out!!" It had never worked. They looked upon that sort of thing as an invitation. She wrote parts of the diary in code these days. Reading didn't come naturally to the Chalk Hill Feegles, so surely they'd never get the hang of a code.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She looked around carefully, in any case, and unlocked the huge padlock that secured a chain around the book. She turned to today's date, dipped her pen in the ink, and wrote: "Met t*."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, a snowflake would be a good code for the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He just stood there, she thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And he ran away because I screamed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which was a good thing, obviously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Um…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But…I wish I hadn't screamed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She opened her hand. The image of the horse was still there, as white as chalk, but there was no pain at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany gave a little shiver and pulled herself together. So? She had met the spirit of Winter. She was a witch. It was the sort of thing that sometimes happened. He'd politely given her back what was hers, and then he'd gone. There was no call to get soppy about it. There were things to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then she wrote: "Ltr frm R."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She very carefully opened the letter from Roland, which was easy because slug slime isn't much of a glue. With any luck she could even reuse the envelope. She hunched over the letter so that no one could read it over her shoulder. Finally she said: "Miss Treason, will you get out of my face, please? I need to use my eyeballs privately."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a pause and then a mutter from downstairs, and the tickling behind her eyes went away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was always…good to get a letter from Roland. Yes, they were often about the sheep, and other things of the Chalk, and sometimes there'd be a dried flower inside, a harebell or a cowslip. Granny Aching wouldn't have approved of that; she always said that if the hills had wanted people to pick the flowers, they would have grown more of them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The letters always made her homesick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One day Miss Treason had said, "This young man who writes to you…is he your beau?" and Tiffany had changed the subject until she had time to look up the word in the dictionary and then more time to stop blushing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland was…well, the thing about Roland was…the main thing about…well, the point was…he was there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Okay, when she'd first really met him, he had been a rather useless, rather stupid lump, but what could you expect? He'd been the prisoner of the Queen of the Elves for a year, to start with, fat as butter and half crazy on sugar and despair. Besides, he'd been brought up by a couple of haughty aunts, his father—the Baron—being mostly more interested in horses and dogs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He'd more and less changed since then: more thoughtful, less rowdy, more serious, less stupid. He'd also had to wear glasses, the first ever seen on the Chalk.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And he had a library! More than a hundred books! Actually, it belonged to the castle, but no one else seemed interested in it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some of the books were huge and ancient, with wooden covers and huge black letters and colored pictures of strange animals and far-off places. There was Waspmire's Book of Unusual Days, Crumberry's Why Things Are Not Otherwise, and all but one volume of the Ominous Encyclopaedia. Roland had been astonished to find that she could read foreign words, and she'd been careful not to tell him it was all done with the help of what remained of Dr. Bustle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The thing was…the fact was…well, who else had they got? Roland couldn't, just couldn't have friends among the village kids, what with him being the son of the Baron and everything. But Tiffany had the pointy hat now, and that counted for something. The people of the Chalk didn't like witches much, but she was Granny Aching's granddaughter, right? No tellin' what she'd learned from the ol' girl, up at the shepherding hut. And they do say she showed those witches up in the mountains what witchin's all about, eh? Remember the lambing last year? She prit near brought dead lambs back to life just by lookin' at 'em! And she's an Aching, and they've got these hills in their bones. She's all right. She's ours, see?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that was fine, except that she didn't have any old friends anymore. Kids back home who'd been friendly were now…respectful, because of the hat. There was a kind of wall, as if she'd grown up and they hadn't. What could they talk about? She'd been to places they couldn't even imagine. Most of them hadn't even been to Twoshirts, which was only half a day away. And this didn't worry them at all. They were going to do the jobs their fathers did, or raise children like their mothers did. And that was fine, Tiffany added hurriedly to herself. But they hadn't decided. It was just happening to them, and they didn't notice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the same up in the mountains. The only people of her own age she could actually talk to were other witches-in-training like Annagramma and the rest of the girls. It was useless trying to have a real conversation with people in the villages, especially the boys. They just looked down and mumbled and shuffled their feet, like people at home when they had to talk to the Baron.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Actually, Roland did that too, and he went red every time she looked at him. Whenever she visited the castle, or walked on the hills with him, the air was full of complicated silences…just like it had been with the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She read the letter carefully, trying to ignore the grubby Feegle fingerprints all over it. He'd been kind enough to include several spare sheets of paper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She smoothed one out, very carefully, stared at the wall for a while, and then began to write.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Down in the scullery,</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">They say that there can never be two snowflakes that are exactly alike, but has anyone checked lately?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Snow fell gently in the darkness. It piled up on rooftops, it kissed its way between the branches of trees, it settled on the forest floor with a gentle sizzle and smelled sharply of tin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax always checked the snow. She stood at her doorway, with the candlelight streaming out around her, and caught flakes on the back of a shovel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The white kitten watched the snowflakes. That's all it did. It didn't bat them with a paw, it just watched, very intently, each flake spiral down until it landed. Then the kitten would watch it some more, until it was sure the entertainment was over, before it looked up and selected another flake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was called You, as in "You! Stop that!" and "You! Get off there!" When it came to names, Granny Weatherwax didn't do fancy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny looked at the snowflakes and smiled in her not-exactly-nice way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Come back in, You," she said, and shut the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Tick was shivering by the fire. It wasn't very big—just big enough. However, there was the smell of bacon and pease pudding coming from a small pot on the embers, and beside the small pot was a much larger one from which came the smell of chicken. Miss Tick didn't often get chicken, so she lived in hope.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It had to be said that Granny Weatherwax and Miss Tick did not get on well with each other. Senior witches often don't. You could tell that they didn't by the way they were extremely polite all the time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The snow is early this year, Mistress Weatherwax," said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Indeed it is, Miss Tick," said Granny Weatherwax. "And so…interesting. Have you looked at it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've seen snow before, Mistress Weatherwax," said Miss Tick. "It was snowing all the way up here. I had to help push the mail coach! I saw altogether too much snow! But what are we going to do about Tiffany Aching?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nothing, Miss Tick. More tea?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She is rather our responsibility."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. She's hers, first and last. She's a witch. She danced the Winter Dance. I saw her do it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure she didn't mean to," said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How can you dance and not mean it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's young. The excitement probably ran away with her feet. She didn't know what was going on."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She should have found out," said Granny Weatherwax. "She should have listened."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure you always did what you were told when you were almost thirteen, Mistress Weatherwax," said Miss Tick with just a hint of sarcasm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax stared at the wall for a moment. "No," she said. "I made mistakes. But I didn't make excuses."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I thought you wanted to help the child?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll help her to help herself. That is my way. She's danced into the oldest Story there is, and the only way out is through the other end. The only way, Miss Tick."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Tick sighed. Stories, she thought. Granny Weatherwax believes the world is all about stories. Oh well, we all have our funny little ways. Except me, obviously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Of course. It's just that she's so…normal," Miss Tick said aloud. "When you consider what she's done, I mean. And she thinks so much. And now that she's come to the attention of the Wintersmith, well…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She fascinates him," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's going to be a big problem."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Which she will have to solve."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And if she can't?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then she's not Tiffany Aching," said Granny Weatherwax firmly. "Ah, yes, she's in the Story now, but she don't know it! Look at the snow, Miss Tick. They say that no two snowflakes are alike. How could they know something like that? Oh, they thinks they're so smart! I've always wanted to catch 'em out. An' I have done! Go outside now, and look at the snow. Look at the snow, Miss Tick! Every flake the same!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Tiffany heard the knocking and opened the tiny bedroom window with difficulty. Snow had built up on the sill, soft and fluffy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We didna want tae wake ye," said Rob Anybody, "but Awf'ly Wee Billy said you ought tae see this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany yawned. "What am I looking for?" she muttered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Catch some o' yon flakes," said Rob. "No, not on yer hand—they'll melt tae soon."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the gloom Tiffany felt around for her diary. It wasn't there. She looked on the floor, in case she'd knocked it off. Then a match flared as Rob Anybody lit a candle, and there was the diary, looking as though it had always been there but, she noticed, also being suspiciously cold to the touch. Rob looked innocent, a sure sign of guilt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany saved the questions for later and poked the diary out of the window. Flakes settled on it, and she lifted it closer to her eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They look just like any ordin—" she began, and then stopped, and then said, "Oh, no…this must be a trick!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye? Well, ye could call it that," said Rob. "But it's his trick, ye ken."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany stared at falling flakes drifting in the light of the candle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Every one of them was Tiffany Aching. A little, frozen, sparkling Tiffany Aching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Downstairs, Miss Treason burst out laughing.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The doorknob on the door to the tower bedroom was rattled angrily. Roland de Chumsfanleigh (pronounced Chuffley; it wasn't his fault) carefully paid it no attention.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What are you doing in there, child?" said a muffled voice peevishly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nothing, Aunt Danuta," said Roland, without turning around from his desk. One of the advantages of living in a castle was that rooms were easy to lock; his door had three iron locks and two bolts that were as thick as his arm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Your father is calling out for you, you know!" said another voice, with even more peeve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He whispers, Aunt Araminta," Roland said calmly, carefully writing an address on an envelope. "He only cries out when you set the doctors on him."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's for his own good!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He cries out," Roland repeated, and then licked the flap on the envelope.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Aunt Araminta rattled the doorknob again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You are a very ungrateful child! You will starve, you know! We will get the guards to batter this door down!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland sighed. The castle had been built by people who did not like to have their doors battered down, and anyone trying to do that here would have to carry the battering ram up a narrow spiral staircase with no room at the top to turn around, and then find a way to knock down a door four planks thick and made of oak timbers so ancient, it was like iron. One man could defend this room for months, if he had provisions. He heard some more grumbling outside and then the echo of the aunts' shoes as they went down the tower. Then he heard them screaming at the guards again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wouldn't do them much good. Sergeant Roberts and his guards over there," said Miss Tick. "They've had Miss Treason for a long, long time. It'll be a tricky task for a new witch."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She'll be a difficult…act to follow, indeed," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Act?" said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I meant life, of course," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Whom will you put in there?" asked Miss Tick, because she liked to be first with the news. She also made a point of saying "whom" whenever she could. She felt it was more literate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Miss Tick, that is not up to me," said Granny sharply. "We have no leaders in witchcraft, you know that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh indeed," said Miss Tick, who also knew that the leader the witches did not have was Granny Weatherwax. "But I know that Mrs. Earwig will be proposing young Annagramma, and Mrs. Earwig has quite a few followers these days. It's probably those books she writes. She makes witchcraft sound exciting."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know I don't like witches who try to impose their will on others," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Quite," said Miss Tick, trying not to laugh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I shall, however, drop a name into the conversation," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a clang, I expect, thought Miss Tick. "Petulia Gristle has shaped up very well," she said. "A good all-around witch."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, but mostly all around pigs," said Granny Weatherwax. "I was thinking about Tiffany Aching."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What?" said Miss Tick. "Don't you think that child has enough to cope with?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax smiled briefly. "Well, Miss Tick, you know what they say: If you want something done, give it to someone who's busy! And young Tiffany might be very busy soon," she added.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why do you say that?" said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hmm. Well, I can't be sure, but I will be very interested to see what happens to her feet…."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Tiffany didn't sleep much on the night before the funeral. Miss Treason's loom had clicked and clacked all through the night, because she had an order for bedsheets she wanted to complete.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was just getting light when Tiffany gave up and got up, in that order. At least she could get the goats mucked out and milked before she tackled the other chores. There was snow, and a bitter wind was blowing it across the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't until she was carting a barrowload of muck to the compost heap, which was steaming gently in the gray light, that she heard the tinkling. It sounded a bit like the wind chimes Miss Pullunder had around her cottage, only they were tuned to a note that was uncomfortable for demons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was coming from the place where the rose bed was in summer. It grew fine, old roses, full of scent and so red they were nearly, yes, black.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The roses were blooming again. But they—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How do you like them, sheep girl?" said a voice. It didn't arrive in her head, it wasn't her thoughts, any of them, and Dr. Bustle didn't wake up until at least ten. It was her own voice, from her own lips. But she hadn't thought it, and she hadn't meant to say it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now she was running back to the cottage. She hadn't decided to do that either, but her legs had taken over. It wasn't fear, not exactly; it was just that she very much wanted to be somewhere other than in the garden with the sun not up and the snow blowing and filling the air with ice crystals as fine as fog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She ran through the scullery door and collided with a dark figure, which said, "Um, sorry," and therefore was Petulia. She was the kind of person who apologized if you trod on her foot. Right now there was no sight more welcome.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry, I was called out to deal with a difficult cow and, um, it wasn't worth going back to bed," Petulia said, and then added: "Are you all right? You don't look it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I heard a voice in my mouth!" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Petulia gave her an odd look and might just have stepped an inch or so backward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You mean in your head?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! I can deal with those! My mouth said words all by itself! And come and see what's grown in the rose garden! You won't believe it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were roses. They were made of ice so thin that, if you breathed on them, they melted away and left nothing but the dead stalks they'd grown on. And there were dozens of them, waving in the wind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Even the heat of my hand near them makes them drip," said Petulia. "Do you think it's your Wintersmith?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's not mine! And I can't think of any other way they'd turn up!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And you think he, um, spoke to you?" said Petulia, plucking another rose. Ice particles slid off her hat every time she moved.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! It was me! I mean, my voice! But it didn't sound like him. I mean, like I think he'd sound! It was a bit snide, like Annagramma when she's in a mood! But it was my voice!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How do you think he'd sound?" said Petulia.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The wind gusted across the clearing, making the pine trees shake and roar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"…Tiffany…be mine…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a little while Petulia coughed and said: "Um, was it just me, or did that sound like—?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not just you," whispered Tiffany, standing very still.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah," said Petulia, in a voice as bright and brittle as a rose of ice. "Well, I think we should get indoors now, yes? Um, and get all the fires lit and some tea made, yes? And then start getting things ready, because quite soon a lot of people will be turning up."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A minute later they were in the cottage, with the doors bolted and every candle spluttering into life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They didn't talk about the wind or the roses. What would be the point? Besides, there was a job to be done. Work, that's what helps. Work, and think and talk later, don't gabble now like frightened ducks. They even managed to get another layer of grime off the windows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All through the morning people arrived from the village with the things Miss Treason had ordered. People were walking across the clearing. The sun was out, even if it was as pale as a poached egg. The world was belonging to…normality. Tiffany caught herself wondering if she was wrong about things. Were there roses? There were none now; the fragile petals had not survived even the dawn's weak light. Had the wind spoken? Then she met Petulia's gaze. Yes, it had happened. But for now there was a funeral to feed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The girls had already got to work on the ham rolls, with three sorts of mustard, but however far wrong you couldn't go with a ham roll, if that was all you were giving seventy or eighty hungry witches, you were going all the way past Wrong and were heading into Absolute Party Disaster. So barrows were arriving with loaves and roasts of beef, and jars of pickled cucumbers so big that they looked like drowned whales. Witches are very keen on pickles, as a rule, but the food they like best is free food. Yes, that's the diet for your working witch: lots of food that someone else is paying for, and so much of it that there is enough to shove in your pockets for later.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As it turned out, Miss Treason wasn't paying for it either. No one would take any money. They wouldn't leave, either, but hung about by the back door looking worried until they could have a word with Tiffany. The conversation, when she could spare the time from slicing and spreading, would go something like this:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's not really dying, is she?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes. At around half past six tomorrow morning."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But she's very old!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes. I think that's sort of why, you see."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But what will we do without her?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know. What did you do before she was here?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She was always here! She knew everything! Who's going to tell us what to do now?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then they'd say: "It's not going to be you, is it?" and give her a Look that said: We hope not. You don't even wear a black dress.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a while Tiffany got fed up with this and in a very sharp voice asked the next person, a woman delivering six cooked chickens: "What about all those stories about her slitting open bad people's bellies with her thumbnail, then?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er, well, yes, but it was never anyone we knew," said the woman virtuously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the demon in the cellar?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So they say. O' course, I never saw it pers'nally." The woman gave Tiffany a worried look. "It is down there, isn't it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You want it to be, Tiffany thought. You actually want there to be a monster in the cellar!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But as far as Tiffany knew, what was in the cellar this morning was a lot of snoring Feegles who had been boozin'. If you put a lot of Feegles in a desert, within twenty minutes they'd find a bottle of something dreadful to drink.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Believe me, madam, you wouldn't want to wake what's down there now," she said, giving the woman a worried smile.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The woman seemed satisfied with that but suddenly looked concerned again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the spiders? She really eats spiders?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, there's lots of webs," said Tiffany, "but you never see a spider!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, right," said the woman, as if she'd been let into a big secret. "Say what you like, Miss Treason's been a real witch. With skulls! I expect you have to polish 'em, eh? Ha! She could spit your eye out as soon as look at you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She never did, though," said a man delivering a huge tray of sausages. "Not to anyone local, anyway."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's true," the woman admitted reluctantly. "She was very gracious in that respect."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, she was a proper old-time witch, Miss Treason," said the sausage man. "Many a man has widdled in his boots when she's turned the sharp side of her tongue on him. You know that weaving she's always doing? She weaves your name into the loom, that's what she does! And if you tell her a lie, your thread breaks and you drop down dead on the spot!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, that happens all the time," said Tiffany, thinking: This is amazing! Boffo has a life of its own!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, we don't get witches like her these days," said a man delivering four dozen eggs. "These days it's all airy-fairy and dancin' around without your drawers on."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They all looked inquiringly at Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's wintertime," she said coldly. "And I've got to get on with my work. The witches will be here soon. Thank you very much."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While they were putting the eggs on to boil, she told Petulia about it. It didn't come as a surprise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Um, they're proud of her," Petulia said. "I've heard them boasting about her up at the pig market in Lancre."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They boast?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes. Like: You think old Mistress Weatherwax is tough? Ours has got skulls! And a demon! She's gonna live forever 'cuz she's got a clockwork heart she winds up every day! And she eats spiders, sure of it! How d'you like them poisoned apples, huh?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Boffo works all by itself, Tiffany thought, once you get it started. Our Baron is bigger than your Baron, our witch is witchier than your witch….</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">The witches started arriving around four o'clock, and Tiffany went out into the clearing to do air traffic control. Annagramma arrived by herself, looking very pale and wearing more occult jewelry than you could imagine. And there was a difficult moment when Mrs. Earwig and Granny Weatherwax arrived at the same time, and circled in a ballet of careful politeness as each waited for the other to land. In the end, Tiffany directed them into different corners of the clearing and hurried away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no sign of the Wintersmith, and she was sure she'd know if he was near. He'd gone far away, she hoped, arranging a gale or conducting a blizzard. The memory of that voice in her mouth remained, awkward and worrying. Like an oyster dealing with a piece of grit, Tiffany coated it with people and hard work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now the day was just another pale, dry, early winter's day. Apart from the food, nothing else at the funeral had been arranged. Witches arrange themselves. Miss Treason sat in her big chair, greeting old friends and old enemies alike.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">In the cottage, the beds were airing, the floors had been swept, and the log basket was full. On the kitchen table the inventory was laid out: so many spoons, so many pans, so many dishes, all lined up in the dingy light. Tiffany packed some of the cheeses, though. She'd made them, after all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The loom was silent in its room; it looked like the bones of some dead animal, but under the big chair was the package Miss Treason had mentioned, wrapped in black paper. Inside it was a cloak woven of brown wool so dark that it was almost black. It looked warm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was it, then. Time to go. If she lay down and put her ear to a mousehole, she could hear widespread snoring coming from the cellar. The Feegles believed that after a really good funeral, everyone should be lying down. It wasn't a good idea to wake them. They'd find her. They always did.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Was that everything? Oh, no, not quite. She took down the Unexpurgated Dictionary and Chaffinch's Mythology, with the "Dacne of the Sneasos" in it, and went to tuck them into a bag under the cheeses. As she did so, the pages flipped like cards and several things dropped out onto the stone floor. Some of them were faded old letters, which she tucked back inside for now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was also the Boffo catalogue. The cover had a grinning clown on it, and the words:</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Yes, you could spend years trying to be a witch, or you could spend a lot of money with Mr. Boffo and be one as soon as the postman arrived.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fascinated, Tiffany turned the pages. There were skulls (Glow in the Dark, $8 Extra) and fake ears and pages of hilarious noses (Ghastly Dangling Booger free on noses over $5) and masks, as Boffo would say, Galore!!! Mask No. 19, for example, was: Wicked Witch De-Luxe, with Mad Greasy Hair, Rotting Teeth, and Hairy Warts (supplied loose, stick them where you like!!!). Miss Treason had obviously stopped short of buying one of these, possibly because the nose looked like a carrot but probably because the skin was bright green. She could also have bought Scary Witch Hands ($8 a pair, with green skin and black fingernails) and Smelly Witch Feet ($9).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany tucked the catalogue back into the book. She couldn't leave it for Annagramma to find, or the secret of Miss Treason's Boffo would be out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that was it: one life, ended and neatly tidied away. One cottage, clean and empty. One girl, wondering what was going to happen next. "Arrangements" would be made.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Clonk-clank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She didn't move, didn't look around. I'm not going to be Boffo'd, she told herself. There's an explanation for that noise that has nothing to do with Miss Treason. Let's see…I cleaned the fireplace, right? And I leaned the poker next to it. But unless you get it just right, it always falls over sooner or later in a sneaky kind of way. That's it. When I turn and look behind me, I'll see that the poker has fallen over and is lying in the grate and therefore the noise wasn't caused by any kind of ghostly clock at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She turned around slowly. The poker was lying in the grate.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now, she thought, it would be a good idea to go outside into the fresh air. It's a bit sad and stuffy in here. That's why I want to go out, because it's sad and stuffy. It's not at all because I'm afraid of any imaginary noises. I'm not superstitious. I'm a witch. Witches aren't superstitious. We are what people are superstitious of. I just don't want to stay. I felt safe here when she was alive—it was like sheltering under a huge tree—but I don't think it is safe anymore. If the Wintersmith makes the trees shout my name, well, I'll cover my ears. The house feels like it's dying and I'm going outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was no point in locking the door. The local people were nervous enough about going inside even when Miss Treason was alive. They certainly wouldn't set foot inside now, not until another witch had made the place her own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A weak, runny-egg kind of sun was showing through the clouds, and the wind had blown the frost away. But a brief autumn turned to winter quickly up here; from now on there would always be the smell of snow in the air. Up in the mountains the winter never ended. Even in the summer, the water in the streams was ice cold from the melting snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany sat down on the old stump with her ancient suitcase and a sack and waited for the Arrangements. Annagramma would be here pretty soon, you could bet on that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cottage already looked abandoned. It seemed like—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was her birthday. The thought pushed itself to the front. Yes, it would be today. Death had got it right. The one big day in the year that was totally hers, and she had forgotten about it in all the excitement, and now it was already two thirds over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Had she ever told Petulia and the others when her birthday was? She couldn't remember.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thirteen years old. But she'd been thinking of herself as "nearly thirteen" for months now. Pretty soon she'd be "nearly fourteen."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She was just about to enjoy a bit of self-pity when there was a stealthy rustling behind her. She turned so quickly that Horace the cheese leaped backward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, it's you," said Tiffany. "Where have you been, you naughty bo—cheese? I was worried sick!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Horace looked ashamed, but it was quite hard to see how he managed it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you going to come with me?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Horace was immediately surrounded by a feeling of yesness.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right. You must get in the sack." Tiffany opened it, but Horace backed away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, if you are going to be a naughty chee—" she began, and stopped. Her hand was itching. She looked up…at the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It had to be him. At first he was just swirling snow in the air, but as he strode across the clearing, he seemed to come together, become human, become a young man with a cloak billowing out behind him and snow on his hair and shoulders. He wasn't transparent this time, not entirely, but something like ripples ran across him, and Tiffany thought she could see the trees behind him, like shadows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She took a few hurried steps backward, but the Wintersmith was crossing the dead grass with the speed of a skater. She could turn and run, but that would mean she was, well, turning and running, and why should she do that? She hadn't been the one scribbling on people's windows!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What should she say, what should she say?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Now, I really appreciated you finding my necklace," she said, backing away again. "And the snowflakes and roses were really very…it was very sweet. But…I don't think that we…well, you're made of cold and I'm not…I'm a human, made of…human stuff."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You must be her," said the Wintersmith. "You were in the Dance! And now you are here, in my winter."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The voice wasn't right. It sounded…fake, somehow, as if the Wintersmith had been taught to say the sound of words without understanding what they were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm a her," she said uncertainly. "I don't know about ‘must be.' Er…please, I'm really sorry about the dance, I didn't mean to, it just seemed so…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He's still got the same purple-gray eyes, she noticed. Purple-gray, in a face sculpted from freezing fog. A handsome face, too. "Look, I never meant to make you think—" she began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Meant?" said the Wintersmith, looking astonished. "But we don't mean. We are!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What do you…mean?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, no…" muttered Tiffany as Feegles erupted from the grass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Feegles didn't know the meaning of the word "fear." Sometimes Tiffany wished they'd read a dictionary. They fought like tigers, they fought like demons, they fought like giants. What they didn't do was fight like something with more than a spoonful of brain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They attacked the Wintersmith with swords, heads, and feet, and the fact that everything went through him as if he were a shadow didn't seem to bother them. If a Feegle aimed a boot at a misty leg and ended up kicking himself in his own head, then it had been a good result.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith ignored them, like a man paying no attention to butterflies.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Where is your power? Why are you dressed like this?" the Wintersmith demanded. "This is not as it should be!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He stepped forward and grabbed Tiffany's wrist hard, much harder than a ghostly hand should be able to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It is wrong!" he shouted. Above the clearing the clouds were moving fast.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany tried to pull away. "Let me go!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You are her!" the Wintersmith shouted, pulling her toward him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany hadn't known where the shout came from, but the slap came from her hand, thinking for itself. It caught the figure on the cheek so hard that for a moment the face blurred, as if she'd smeared a painting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't come near me! Don't touch me!" she screamed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a flicker behind the Wintersmith. Tiffany couldn't see it clearly because of the icy haze and her own anger and terror, but something blurred and dark was moving toward them across the clearing, wavering and distorted like a figure seen through ice. It loomed behind the transparent figure for one dark moment, and then became Granny Weatherwax, in the same space as the Wintersmith…inside him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He screamed for a second, and exploded into a mist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny stumbled forward, blinking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Urrrgh. It'll take a while to get the taste of that out of my head," she said. "Shut your mouth, girl—something might fly into it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany shut her mouth. Something might fly into it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What…what did you do to him?" she managed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It!" snapped Granny, rubbing her forehead. "It's an it, not a he! An it that thinks it's a he! Now give me your necklace!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What! But it's mine!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do you think I want an argument?" Granny Weatherwax demanded. "Does it say on my face I want an argument? Give it to me now! Don't you dare defy me!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I won't just—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax lowered her voice and, in a piercing hiss much worse than a scream, said: "It's how it finds you. Do you want it to find you again? It's just a fog now. How solid do you think it will become?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany thought about that strange face, not moving like a real one should, and that strange voice, putting words together as if they were bricks….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She undid the little silver clasp and held up the necklace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It's just Boffo, she told herself. Every stick is a wand, every puddle is a crystal ball. This is just a…a thing. I don't need it to be me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, I do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You must give it to me," said Granny softly. "I can't take it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She held out her hand, palm up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany dropped the horse into it and tried not to see Granny Weatherwax's fingers as a closing claw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Very well," said Granny, satisfied. "Now we must go."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You were watching me," said Tiffany sullenly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All morning. You could have seen me if you'd thought to look," said Granny. "But you didn't do a bad job at the burial, I'll say that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I did a good job!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's what I said."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No," said Tiffany, still trembling. "You didn't."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've never held with skulls and suchlike," said Granny, ignoring this. "Artificial ones, at any rate. But Miss Treason—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She stopped, and Tiffany saw her stare at the treetops.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is that him again?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No," said Granny, as if this were something to be disappointed about. "No, that's young Miss Hawkin. And Mrs. Letice Earwig. Didn't hang about, I see. And Miss Treason hardly cooled down." She sniffed. "Some people might have had the common decency not to snatch."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The two broomsticks landed a little way off. Annagramma looked nervous. Mrs. Earwig looked like she always did: tall, pale, very well dressed, wearing lots of occult jewelry and an expression that said you were slightly annoying her but she was being gracious enough not to let it show. And she always looked at Tiffany, when she ever bothered to look at her at all, as if Tiffany were some kind of strange creature that she didn't quite understand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mrs. Earwig was always polite to Granny, in a formal and chilly way. It made Granny Weatherwax mad, but that was the way of witches. When they really disliked one another, they were as polite as duchesses.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the other two approached, Granny bowed low and removed her hat. Mrs. Earwig did the same thing, only the bow was a little lower.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany saw Granny glance up and then bow lower still, by about an inch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mrs. Earwig managed to go half an inch farther down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany and Annagramma exchanged a hopeless glance over the straining backs. Sometimes this sort of thing could go on for hours.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax gave a grunt and straightened up. So did Mrs. Earwig, red in the face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Blessin's be upon our meetin'," said Granny in a calm voice. Tiffany winced. This was a declaration of hostilities. Yelling and prodding with the fingers was perfectly ordinary witch arguing, but speaking carefully and calmly was open warfare.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How kind of you to greet us," said Mrs. Earwig.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hopes I sees you in good health?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I keep well, Miss Weatherwax." Annagramma shut her eyes. That was a kick in the stomach, by witch standards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's Mistress Weatherwax, Mrs. Earwig," said Granny. "As I believes you know?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why, yes. Of course it is. I am so sorry." These vicious blows having been exchanged, Granny went on: "I trust Miss Hawkin will find everything to her likin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure that—" Mrs. Earwig stared at Tiffany, her face a question.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tiffany," said Tiffany helpfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tiffany. Of course. What a lovely name…. I'm sure that Tiffany has done her very best," said Mrs. Earwig. "However, we shall shrive and consecrate the cottage, in case of…influences."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I already scrubbed and scrubbed everything! Tiffany thought.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Influences?" said Granny Weatherwax. Even the Wintersmith could not have managed a voice so icy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And disquieting vibrations," said Mrs. Earwig.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, I know about those," said Tiffany. "It's the loose floorboard in the kitchen. If you tread on it, it makes the dresser wobble."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There has been talk of a demon," said Mrs. Earwig, gravely ignoring this. "And…skulls."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But—" Tiffany began, and Granny's hand squeezed her shoulder so hard she stopped.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Deary, deary me," said Granny, still holding on tightly. "Skulls, eh?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There are some very disturbing stories," said Mrs. Earwig, watching Tiffany. "Of the darkest nature, Mistress Weatherwax. I feel that the people in this steading have been very badly served, indeed. Dark forces have been unleashed."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany wanted to yell: No! It was all stories! It was all Boffo! She watched over them! She stopped their stupid arguments, she remembered their laws, she scolded their silliness! She couldn't do that if she was just a frail old lady! She had to be a myth! But Granny's grip kept her silent.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Strange forces are certainly at work," said Granny Weatherwax. "I wish you well in your endeavors, Mrs. Earwig. If you will excuse me?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Of course, Mis—tress Weatherwax. May good stars attend you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"May the road slow down to meet your feet," said Granny. She stopped gripping Tiffany so hard but nevertheless almost dragged her around the side of the cottage. The late Miss Treason's broomstick was leaning against the wall.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tie your stuff on quickly!" she commanded. "We must move!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is he going to come back?" asked Tiffany, struggling to tie the sack and old suitcase onto the bristles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not yet. Not soon, I think. But it will be looking for you. And it will be stronger. Dangerous to you, I believe, and those around you! You have such a lot to learn! You have such a lot to do!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I thanked him! I tried to be nice to him! Why is he still interested in me?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Because of the Dance," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sorry about that!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not good enough. What does a storm know of sorrow? You must make amends. Did you really think that space was left there for you? Oh, this is so tangled! How are your feet?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany, angry and bewildered, stopped with one leg half over the stick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"My feet? What about my feet?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do they itch? What happens when you take your boots off?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nothing! I just see my socks! What have my feet got to do with anything?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We shall find out," said Granny, infuriatingly. "Now, come along."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany tried to get the stick to rise, but it barely cleared the dead grass. She looked around. The bristles were covered with Nac Mac Feegles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Dinna mind us," said Rob Anybody. "We'll hold on tight!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' dinna make it too bumpy, 'cuz I feel like the top o' mah heid's come off," said Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do we get meals on this flight?" said Big Yan. "I'm fair boggin' for a wee drink."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can't take you all!" said Tiffany. "I don't even know where I'm going!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax glared at the Feegles. "You'll have to walk. We're travelin' to Lancre Town. The address is Tir Nani Ogg, The Square."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tir Nani Ogg," said Tiffany. "Isn't that—?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It means Nanny Ogg's Place," said Granny, as Feegles dropped off the broomstick. "You'll be safe there. Well, more or less. But we must make a stop on the way. We must put that necklace as far away from you as we can. And I know how to do that! Oh, yes!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Nac Mac Feegle jogged through the afternoon woods. Local wildlife had found out about Feegles, so the fluffy woodland creatures had all dived for their burrows or climbed high into the trees, but after a while Big Yan called a halt and said: "There's somethin' trackin' us!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't be daft," said Rob Anybody. "There's nothin' left in these woods that's mad enough tae hunt Feegles!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I know what I'm sensin'," said Big Yan stubbornly. "I can feel it in my watter. There's somethin' creepin' up on us right noo!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Weel, I'm not one tae argue wi' a man's watter," said Rob wearily. "Okay, lads, spread oot inna big circle!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Swords drawn, the Feegles spread out, but after a few minutes there was a general muttering. There was nothing to see, nothing to hear. A few birds sang, at a safe distance. Peace and quiet, unusual in the vicinity of Feegles, was everywhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry, Big Yan, but I'm thinkin' yer watter is no' on the button this time," said Rob Anybody.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was at this point that Horace the cheese dropped from a branch onto his head.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">A lot of water flowed under the big bridge at Lancre, but from up here you could barely see it because of the spray coming from the waterfalls a little farther on, spray that hovered in the freezing air. There was white water all through the deep gorge, and then the river leaped the waterfall like a salmon and hit the plains below like a thunderstorm. From the base of the falls you could follow the river all the way past the Chalk, but it moved in wide, lazy curves, and it was quicker to fly in a straight line.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany had flown up it just once, when Miss Level had first brought her into the mountains. Since then she'd always taken the long way down, cruising just above the zigzagging coach road. Flying out over the edge of that furious torrent into a sudden drop full of cold damp air and then pointing the stick almost straight down was pretty high on her list of things she never intended to do, ever.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now Granny Weatherwax stood on the bridge, the silver horse in her hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's the only way," she said. "It'll end up at the bottom of the deep sea. Let the Wintersmith look for you there!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany nodded. She wasn't crying, which is not the same as, well, not crying. People walked around not crying all the time and didn't think about it at all. But now, she did. She thought: I'm not crying….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It made sense. Of course it made sense. It was all Boffo! Every stick is a wand, every puddle is a crystal ball. No thing had any power that you didn't put there. Shambles and skulls and wands were like…shovels and knives and spectacles. They were like…levers. With a lever you could lift a big rock, but the lever didn't do any work.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It has to be your choice," said Granny. "I can't make it for you. But it's a small thing, and while you have it, it will be dangerous."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know, I don't think he wanted to hurt me. He was just upset," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really? Do you want to meet it upset again?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany thought about that strange face. There had been the shape of a human there—more or less—but it was as if the Wintersmith had heard of the idea of being human but hadn't found out how to do it yet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You think he'll harm other people?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He is the Winter, child. It's not all pretty snowflakes, is it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany held out her hand. "Give it back to me, please."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny handed it over with a shrug.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It lay in Tiffany's hand, on the strange white scar. It was the first thing she had ever been given that wasn't useful, that wasn't supposed to do something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I don't need this, she thought. My power comes from the Chalk. But is that what life's going to be like? Nothing that you don't need?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We should tie it to something that's light," she said in a matter-of-fact voice. "Otherwise it will get caught on the bottom."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After some rooting around in the grass near the bridge, she found a stick and wrapped the silver chain around it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was noon. Tiffany had invented the word noonlight because she liked the sound of it. Anyone could be a witch at midnight, she'd thought, but you'd have to be really good to be a witch by noonlight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Good at being a witch, anyway, she thought now as she walked back onto the bridge. Not good at being a happy person.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She threw the necklace off the bridge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She didn't make a big thing of it. It would have been nice to say that the silver horse glittered in the light, seemed to hang in the air for a moment before falling the long fall. Perhaps it did, but Tiffany didn't look.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is it all over now?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No! You danced into a story, girl, one that tells itself to the world every year. It's the Story about ice and fire, Summer and Winter. You've made it wrong. You've got to stay to the end and make sure it turns out right. The horse is just buyin' you time, that's all."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How much time?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know. This hasn't happened before. Time to think, at least. How are your feet?"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith was moving through the world without, in any human sense, moving at all. Wherever winter was, he was too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was trying to think. He'd never had to do this before, and it hurt. Up until now humans had just been parts of the world that moved around in strange ways and lit fires. Now he was spinning himself a mind, and everything was new.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A human…made of human stuff…that was what she had said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Human stuff. He had to make himself of human stuff for the beloved. In the chill of morgues and the wreckage of ships, the Wintersmith rode the air searching for human stuff. And what was it? Dirt and water, mostly. Leave a human long enough and even the water would go, and there would be nothing but a few handfuls of dust that blew away in the wind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So, since water did not think, all the work was being done by the dust.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith was logical, because ice was logical. Water was logical. Wind was logical. There were rules. So what a human was all about was…the right kind of dust!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And, while he was searching for it, he could show her how strong he was.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">That evening Tiffany sat on the edge of her new bed, the clouds of sleep rising in her brain like thunderheads, and yawned and stared at her feet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They were pink, and had five toes each. They were pretty good feet, considering.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Normally when people met you, they'd say things like "How are you?" Nanny Ogg had just said: "Come on in. How's your feet?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Suddenly everyone was interested in her feet. Of course, feet were important, but what did people expect to happen to them?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She swung them back and forth on the ends of her legs. They didn't do anything strange, so she got into bed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She hadn't slept properly for two nights. She hadn't really understood that until she'd reached Tir Nani Ogg, when her brain had started to spin of its own accord. She'd talked to Mrs. Ogg, but it was hard to remember what about. Voices had banged in her ears. Now, at last, she had nothing to do but sleep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a good bed, the best she'd ever slept in. It was the best room she'd ever been in, although she'd been too tired to explore it. Witches didn't go in much for comfort, especially in spare bedrooms, but Tiffany had grown up on an ancient bed where the springs went gloing every time she moved, and with care she could get them to play a tune.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This mattress was thick and yielding. She sank into it as if it were very soft, very warm, very slow quicksand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The trouble is, you can shut your eyes but you can't shut your mind. As she lay in the dark, it squiggled pictures inside her head, of clocks that went clonk-clank, of snowflakes shaped like her, of Miss Treason striding through the nighttime forest, seeking bad people with her yellow thumbnail ready.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Myth Treason…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She drifted through these scrambled memories into dull whiteness. But it got brighter, and took on detail, little areas of black and gray. They began to move gently from side to side….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany opened her eyes, and everything became clear. She was standing on a…a boat, no, a big sailing ship. There was snow on the decks, and icicles hung from the rigging. It was sailing in the washing-up-water light of dawn, on a silent gray sea full of floating ice and clouds of fog. The rigging creaked, the wind sighed in the sails. There was no one to be seen.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah. This appears to be a dream. Let me out, please," said a familiar voice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who are you?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You. Cough, please."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany thought: Well, if this is a dream…and she coughed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A figure grew up out of the snow on the deck. It was her, and she was looking around thoughtfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you me too?" Tiffany asked. Strangely, here on the freezing deck, it didn't seem that, well, strange.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hmm. Oh, yes," said the other Tiffany, still staring intently at things. "I'm your Third Thoughts. Remember? The part of you that never stops thinking? The bit that notices little details? It's good to be out in fresh air. Hmm."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is there something wrong?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, this clearly appears to be a dream. If you would care to look, you'll see that the steersman in yellow oilskins up there at the wheel is the Jolly Sailor off the wrappers of the tobacco that Granny Aching used to smoke. He always comes into our mind when we think about the sea, yes?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany looked up at the bearded figure, who gave her a cheerful wave.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, that's certainly him!" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But I don't think this is our dream, exactly," said the Third Thoughts. "It's too…real."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany reached down and picked up a handful of snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Feels real," she said. "Feels cold." She made a snowball and threw it at herself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I really wish I wouldn't do that," said the other Tiffany, brushing the snow off her shoulder. "But you see what I mean? Dreams are never as…nondreamlike as this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I know what I mean," said Tiffany. "I think they're going to be real, and then something weird turns up."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Exactly. I don't like it all. If this is a dream, then something horrible is going to happen…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They looked ahead of the ship. There was a dismal, dirty bank of fog there, spreading out across the sea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There's something in the fog!" said the Tiffanys together.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They turned and scurried up the ladder to the man at the wheel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Keep away from the fog! Please don't go near it!" Tiffany shouted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Jolly Sailor took his pipe out of his mouth and looked puzzled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A Good Smoke in Any Weather?" he said to Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's all he can say!" said her Third Thoughts, grabbing the wheel. "Remember? That's what he says on the label!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Jolly Sailor pushed her away gently. "A Good Smoke in Any Weather," he said soothingly. "In Any Weather."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Look, we only want to—" Tiffany began, but her Third Thoughts, without a word, put a hand on her head and turned her around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something was coming out of the fog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was an iceberg, a large one, at least five times as high as the ship, as majestic as a swan. It was so big that it was causing its own weather. It seemed to be moving slowly; there was white water around its base. Snow fell around it. Streamers of fog trailed behind it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Jolly Sailor's pipe dropped out of his mouth as he stared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A Good Smoke!" he swore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The iceberg was Tiffany. It was a Tiffany hundreds of feet high, formed of glittering green ice, but it was still a Tiffany. There were seabirds perched on her head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It can't be the Wintersmith doing this!" said Tiffany. "I threw the horse away!" She cupped her hands to her mouth and shouted: "I THREW THE HORSE AWAY!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her voice echoed off the looming ice figure. A few birds took off from the huge cold head, screaming. Behind Tiffany, the ship's wheel spun. The Jolly Sailor stamped a foot and pointed to the white sails above them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A Good Smoke in Any Weather!" he commanded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean!" said Tiffany desperately.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The man pointed to the sails and made frantic pulling motions with his hands.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A Good Smoke!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry, I just can't understand you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sailor snorted and ran off toward a rope, which he hauled on in a great hurry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's gotten weird," said her Third Thoughts quietly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, yes, I should think a huge iceberg shaped like me is a—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, that's just strange. This is weird," said her Third Thoughts. "We've got passengers. Look." She pointed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Down on the main deck there was a row of hatches with big iron grids on them; Tiffany hadn't noticed them before.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hands, hundreds of them, pale as roots under a log, groping and waving, were thrusting through the grids.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Passengers?" Tiffany whispered in horror. "Oh, no…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the screaming started. It would have been better, but not a lot better, if it had been cries of "Help! and "Save us," but instead it was just screaming and wailing, just the sounds of people in pain and fear—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Come back inside my head," she said grimly. "It's too distracting to have you running around outside. Right now."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll walk in from behind you," said her Third Thoughts. "Then it won't seem so—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany felt a twinge of pain, and a change in her mind, and thought: Well, I suppose it could have been a lot messier.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Okay. Let me think. Let all of me think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She watched the desperate hands, waving like weeds underwater, and thought: I'm in something like a dream, but I don't think it's mine. I'm on a ship, and we're going to get killed by an iceberg that's a giant figure of me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think I liked it better when I was snowflakes….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Whose dream is this?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What is this about, Wintersmith?" she asked, and her Third Thoughts, back where they should be, commented: It's amazing, you can even see your own breath in the air.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is this a warning?" Tiffany shouted. "What do you want?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You for my bride, said the Wintersmith. The words just arrived in her memory.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's shoulders sank.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You know this isn't real, said her Third Thoughts. But it may be the shadow of something real….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I shouldn't have let Granny Weatherwax send Rob Anybody away like that—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens! Shiver me timber!" shouted a voice behind her. And then there was the usual clamor:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's ‘timbers,' ye dafty!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye? But I can only find one!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Splice the big plank! Daft Wullie's just walked intae the watter!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The big puddin'! I told him, just the one eye patch!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"With a yo hoho and a ho yoyo—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Feegles erupted from the cabin behind Tiffany, and Rob Anybody stopped in front of her as the rest streamed past. He saluted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sorry we're a wee bittie late, but we had to find the black patches," he said. "There's sich a thing as style, ye ken."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany was speechless, but only for a moment. She pointed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We've got to stop this ship from hitting that iceberg!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Just that? Nae problemo!" Rob looked past her to the looming ice giantess and grinned. "He's got yer nose just right, eh?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Just stop it! Please?" Tiffany pleaded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye-aye! C'mon, lads!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Watching the Feegles working was like watching ants, except that ants didn't wear kilts and shout "Crivens!" all the time. Maybe it was because they could make one word do so much work that they seemed to have no problem at all with the Jolly Sailor's orders. They swarmed across the deck. Mysterious ropes were pulled. Sails moved and billowed to a chorus of "A Good Smoke!" and "Crivens!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now the Wintersmith wants to marry me, Tiffany thought. Oh, dear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd sometimes wondered if she'd get married one day, but she was definite that now was too soon for "one day." Yes, her mother had been married when she was still fourteen, but that was the sort of thing that happened in the olden days. There were a lot of things to be done before Tiffany ever got married, she was very clear about that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Besides, when you thought about it…yuk. He wasn't even a person. He'd be too—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thud! went the wind in the sails. The ship creaked and leaned over, and everyone was shouting at her. Mostly they shouted, "The wheel! Grab the wheel right noo!" although there was also a desperate "A Good Smoke in Any Weather!" in there too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany turned to see the wheel spinning in a blur. She made a snatch at it and got thumped across the fingers by the spokes, but there was a length of rope coiled nearby and she managed to lasso the wheel with a loop and jerk it to a halt without sliding along the deck too much. Then she grabbed the wheel and tried to turn it the other way. It was like pushing a house, but it did move, very slowly at first and then faster as she put her back into it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ship came around. She could feel it moving, beginning to head a little bit away from the iceberg, not directly for it. Good! Things were going right at last! She spun the wheel some more, and now the huge cold wall was sliding past, filling the air with mist. Everything was going to be all right after—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ship hit the iceberg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It started with a simple crack! as a spar caught on an outcrop, but then others smashed as the ship scraped along the side of the ice. Then there were some sharp splintering noises as the ship ground onward, and bits of plank shot up on columns of foaming water. The top of a mast broke off, dragging sails and rigging with it. A lump of ice smashed onto the deck a few feet away from Tiffany, showering her with needles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This isn't how it's supposed to go!" she panted, hanging on to the wheel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Marry me, said the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Churning white water roared across the foundering ship. Tiffany held on for a moment longer; then the cold surf covered her…except that it was suddenly not cold, but warm. But it was still stopping her from breathing. In the darkness she tried to fight her way to the surface, until the blackness was suddenly pulled aside, her eyes filled with light, and a voice said: "I'm sure these mattresses are far too soft, but you can't tell Mrs. Ogg a thing."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany blinked. She was in bed, and a skinny woman with worried hair and a rather red nose was standing by it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You were tossing and turning like a mad thing," the woman said, putting a steaming mug on the small table by the bed. "One day someone will suffikate, mark my words."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany blinked again. I'm supposed to think: Oh, it was just a dream. But it wasn't just a dream. Not my dream.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What time is it?" she managed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"About seven," said the woman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Seven!" Tiffany pushed the sheets back. "I've got to get up! Mrs. Ogg will be wanting her breakfast!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I shouldn't think so. I took it to her in bed not ten minutes ago," said the woman, giving Tiffany a Look. "And I'm off home." She sniffed. "Drink your tea before it gets cold." And with that she marched toward the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is Mrs. Ogg ill?" asked Tiffany, looking everywhere for her socks. She'd never heard of anyone who wasn't really old or very ill having a meal in bed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ill? I don't think she's had a day's illness in her life," said the woman, managing to suggest that in her opinion this was unfair. She shut the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even the bedroom floor was smooth—not made smooth by centuries of feet that had worn down the planks and taken all the splinters out, but because someone had sanded and varnished it. Tiffany's bare feet stuck to it slightly. There was no dust to be seen, no spiderwebs anywhere. The room was bright and fresh and exactly unlike any room in a witch's cottage ought to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm going to get dressed," she said to the air. "Are there any Feegles in here?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, no," said a voice from under the bed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was some frantic whispering and the voice said: "That is tae say, there's hardly any o' us here at a'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then shut your eyes," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She got dressed, taking occasional sips of the tea as she did so. Tea brought to your bedside when you weren't ill? That sort of thing happened to kings and queens!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then she noticed the bruise on her fingers. It didn't hurt at all, but the skin was blue where the ship's wheel had hit it. Right…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Feegles?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens, ye'll nae be foolin' us a second time," said the voice from under the bed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Get out here where I can see you, Daft Wullie!" Tiffany commanded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's real hagglin', miss, the way ye always ken it's me."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After some more urgent whispering, Daft Wullie—for it was indeed he—trooped out with two more Feegles and Horace the cheese.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany stared. All right, he was a blue cheese, so he was about the same color as a Feegle. And he acted like a Feegle, no doubt about that. Why, though, had he got a grubby strip of Feegle tartan around him?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He kinda found us," said Daft Wullie, putting his arm around as much of Horace as was possible. "Can I keep him? He understands evera word I say!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's amazing, because I don't," said Tiffany. "Look, were we in a shipwreck last night?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye. Sorta."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sort of? Was it real or wasn't it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye," said the Feegle nervously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Which?" Tiffany insisted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Kinda real, and kinda not real, in a real unreal sorta way," said Daft Wullie, squirming a bit. "I don't have the knowin' o' the right wurdies…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are all you Feegles okay?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh aye, miss," said Daft Wullie, brightening up. "Nae problemo. It wuz only a dream ship on a dream sea, after a'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And a dream iceberg?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, no. The iceberg was real, mistress."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I thought so! Are you sure?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye. We're good at the knowin' o' stuff like that," said Daft Wullie. "That's so, eh, lads?" The other two Feegles, in total awe of being in the presence of the big wee hag without the safety of hundreds of brothers around them, nodded at Tiffany and then tried to shuffle behind each other.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A real iceberg shaped like me is floating around on the sea?" said Tiffany in horror. "Getting in the way of shipping?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye. Could be," said Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm going to get into so much trouble!" said Tiffany, standing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a snapping noise, and the end of one of the floorboards leaped out of the floor and hung there, bouncing up and down with a rocking-chair noise. It had ripped out two long nails.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And now this," said Tiffany weakly. But the Feegles and Horace had vanished.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Behind Tiffany someone laughed, although it was maybe more of a chuckle, deep and real and with just a hint that maybe someone had told a rude joke.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Those little devils can't half run, eh?" said Nanny Ogg, ambling into the room. "Now then, Tiff, I wants you to turn around slowly and go and sit on your bed with your feet off the ground. Can you do that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Of course, Mrs. Ogg," said Tiffany. "Look, I'm sorry about—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Poo, what's a floorboard more or less?" said Nanny Ogg. "I'm much more worried about Esme Weatherwax. She said there might be something like this! Ha, she was right and Miss Tick was wrong! There'll be no living with her after this! She'll have her nose so far in the air, her feet won't touch the ground!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">With a spioioioiiing! sound, another floorboard sprang up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And it might be a good idea if yours didn't either, miss," Nanny Ogg added. "I'll be back in half a tick."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That turned out to be the same length of time as twenty-seven seconds, when Nanny returned carrying a pair of violently pink slippers with bunny rabbits on them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"My second-best pair," she said as, behind her, a board went plunk! and hurled four big nails into the far wall. The boards that had already sprung up were beginning to sprout what looked a lot like leaves. They were thin and weedy, but leaves were what they were.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is it me doing this?" asked Tiffany nervously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I daresay Esme will want to tell you all about it herself," said Nanny, helping Tiffany's feet into the slippers. "But what you've got here, miss, is a bad case of Ped Fecundis." In the back of Tiffany's memory Dr. Sensibility Bustle, D. M. Phil., B. El L., stirred in his sleep for a moment and took care of the translation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Fertile Feet?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well done! I didn't expect anything to happen to floorboards, mind you, but it makes sense, when you think about it. They're made of wood, after all, so they're tryin' to grow."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mrs. Ogg?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Please? I haven't got a clue what you're talking about! I keep my feet very clean! And I think I'm a giant iceberg!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg gave her a slow, kind look. Tiffany stared into dark, twinkling eyes. Don't try to trick her or hold anything back from those eyes, said her Third Thoughts. Everyone says she's been Granny Weatherwax's best friend since they were girls. And that means that under all those wrinkles must be nerves of steel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Kettle's on downstairs," said Nanny brightly. "Why don't you come down and tell me all about it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany had looked up "strumpet" in the Unexpurgated Dictionary, and found it meant "a woman who is no better than she should be" and "a lady of easy virtue." This, she decided after some working out, meant that Mrs. Gytha Ogg, known as Nanny, was a very respectable person. She found virtue easy, for one thing. And if she was no better than she should be, then she was just as good as she ought to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She had a feeling that Miss Treason hadn't meant this, but you couldn't argue with logic.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg was good at listening, at least. She listened like a great big ear, and before Tiffany realized it, she was telling her everything. Everything. Nanny sat on the opposite side of the big kitchen table, puffing gently at a pipe with a hedgehog carved on it. Sometimes she'd ask a little question, like "Why was that?" or "And then what happened?" and off they'd go again. Nanny's friendly little smile could drag out of you things you didn't know you knew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">While they talked, Tiffany's Third Thoughts scanned the room out of the corners of her eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was wonderfully clean and bright, and there were ornaments everywhere—cheap, jolly ones, the sort that have things like "To the World's Best Mum" on them. And where there weren't ornaments, there were pictures of babies and children and families.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany had thought that only grand folk lived in homes like this. There were oil lamps! There was a bath, made of tin, hanging conveniently on a hook outside the privy! There was a pump actually indoors! But Nanny ambled around in her rather worn black dress, not grand at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the best chair in the room of ornaments, a large gray cat watched Tiffany with a half-open eye that glinted with absolute evil. Nanny had referred to him as "Greebo…don't mind him, he's just a big old softie," which Tiffany knew enough to interpret as "he'll have his claws in your leg if you go anywhere near him."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany talked as she hadn't talked to anyone before. It must be a kind of magic, her Third Thoughts concluded. Witches soon picked up ways of controlling people with their voices, but Nanny Ogg listened at you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This lad Roland who is not your young man," said Nanny, when Tiffany had paused for breath. "Thinking of marrying him, are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't lie, her Third Thoughts insisted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I…well, your mind comes up with all kinds of things when you're not paying attention, doesn't it?" said Tiffany. "It's not like thinking. Anyway, all the other boys I've met just stare at their stupid feet! Petulia says it's because of the hat."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, taking it off helps," said Nanny Ogg. "Mind you, so did a low-cut bodice, when I was a girl. Stopped 'em lookin' at their stupid feet, I don't mind telling you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany saw the dark eyes locked onto her. She burst out laughing. Mrs. Ogg's face broke into a huge grin that should have been locked up for the sake of public decency, and for some reason Tiffany felt a lot better. She'd passed some kind of test.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mind you, that probably wouldn't work with the Wintersmith, of course," said Nanny, and the gloom came down again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I didn't mind the snowflakes," said Tiffany. "But the iceberg—I think that was a bit much."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Showing off in front of the girls," said Nanny, puffing at her hedgehog pipe. "Yes, they do that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But he can kill people!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's Winter. It's what he does. But I reckon he's in a bit of a tizzy because he's never been in love with a human before."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"In love?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, he probably thinks he is."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Once again the eyes watched her carefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's an elemental, and they're simple, really," Nanny Ogg went on. "But he's trying to be human. And that's complicated. We're packed with stuff he doesn't understand—can't understand, really. Anger, for example. A blizzard is never angry. The storm don't hate the people who die in it. The wind is never cruel. But the more he thinks about you, the more he's having to deal with feelings like this, and there's none can teach him. He's not very clever. He's never had to be. And the interesting thing is that you are changin' too—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a knocking at the door. Nanny Ogg got up and opened it. Granny Weatherwax was there, with Miss Tick peering over her shoulder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Blessings be upon this house," said Granny, but in a voice that suggested that if blessings needed to be taken away, she could do that, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Quite probably," said Nanny Ogg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's Ped Fecundis, then?" Granny nodded at Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Looks like a bad case. The floorboards started growing after she walked over them in bare feet."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ha! Have you given her anything for it?" said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I prescribed a pair of slippers."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I really don't see how avatarization could be taking place, not when we're talking about elementals, it makes no—" Miss Tick began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do stop wittering, Miss Tick," said Granny Weatherwax. "I notices you witter when things goes wrong, and it is not being a help."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't want to worry the child, that's all," said Miss Tick. She took Tiffany's hand, patted it, and said, "Don't you worry, Tiffany, we'll—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's a witch," said Granny sternly. "We just have to tell her the truth."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You think I'm turning into a…a goddess?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was worth it to see their faces. The only mouth not in an O was the one belonging to Granny Weatherwax, which was smirking. She looked like someone whose dog has just done a rather good trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How did you work that out?" Granny asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Dr. Bustle had a guess: Avatar, an incarnation of a god. But I'm not going to tell you that, Tiffany thought. "Well, am I?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes," said Granny Weatherwax. "The Wintersmith thinks you are…oh, she's got a lot of names. The Lady of the Flowers is a nice one. Or the Summer Lady. She makes the summertime, just like he makes the winter. He thinks you're her."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right," said Tiffany. "But we know he's wrong, don't we?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…not quite as wrong as we'd like," said Miss Tick.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Most of the Feegles had camped out in Nanny Ogg's barn, where they were holding a council of war, except that it was about something that isn't quite the same thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What we've got here," Rob Anybody pronounced, "is a case o' Romance."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What's that, Rob?" asked a Feegle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, is it like how wee babbies are made?" asked Daft Wullie. "Ye told about that last year. It wuz verra interestin', although a bit far-fetched tae my mind."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No' exactly," said Rob Anybody. "An' it's kinda hard tae describe. But I reckon yon Wintersmith wants to romance the big wee hag and she disna ken what tae do aboot it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So it is like how babbies are made?" said Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, 'cuz even beasties know that but only people know aboot Romancin'," said Rob. "When a bull coo meets a lady coo, he disna have tae say, ‘My heart goes bang-bang-bang when I see your wee face,' 'cuz it's kinda built intae their heads. People have it more difficult. Romancin' is verra important, ye ken. Basically it's a way the boy can get close to the girl wi'oot her attackin' him and scratchin' his eyes oot."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I dinna see how we can teach her any o' that stuff," said Slightly Mad Angus.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The big wee hag reads books," said Rob Anybody. "When she sees a book she just canna help herself. An' I," he added proudly, "have a Plan."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Feegles relaxed. They always felt happier when Rob had a Plan, especially since most plans of his boiled down to screaming and rushing at something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tell us aboot the Plan, Rob," said Big Yan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah'm glad ye asked me," said Rob. "The Plan is: We'll find her a book aboot Romancin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' how will we find this book, Rob?" asked Billy Bigchin uncertainly. He was a loyal gonnagle, but he was also bright enough to get nervous whenever Rob Anybody had a Plan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody airily waved a hand. "Ach," he said, "we ken this trick! A' we need is a big hat an' coat an' a coat hanger an' a broom handle!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh aye?" said Big Yan. "Well, I'm not bein' doon in the knee again!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">With witches everything is a test. That's why they tested Tiffany's feet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I bet that I'm the only person in the world about to do this, she thought as she lowered both her feet into a tray of soil that Nanny had hastily shoveled up. Granny Weatherwax and Miss Tick were both sitting on bare wooden chairs, despite the fact that the gray cat Greebo was occupying the whole of one big saggy armchair. You didn't want to wake up Greebo when he wanted to sleep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Can you feel anything?" asked Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's a bit cold, that's all—oh…something's happening…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Green shoots appeared around her feet, and grew quickly. Then they went white at the base and gently pushed Tiffany's feet aside as they began to swell.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Onions?" said Granny Weatherwax scornfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, they were the only seeds I could find quickly," said Nanny Ogg, poking at the glistening white bulbs. "Good size. Well done, Tiff."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny looked shocked. "You're not going to eat those, are you, Gytha?" she said accusingly. "You are, aren't you? You're going to eat them!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg, standing up with a bunch of onions in each pudgy hand, looked guilty, but only for a moment.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why not?" she said stoutly. "Fresh vegetables are not to be sneezed at in the winter. And anyway, her feet are nice and clean."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's not seemly," said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It didn't hurt," said Tiffany. "All I had to do was put my feet on the tray for a moment."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, she says it didn't hurt," Nanny Ogg insisted. "Now, I think I might have some old carrot seeds in the kitchen drawer—" She saw the expressions on the faces of the others. "All right, all right, then. There's no need to look like that," she said. "I was just tryin' to point out the silver lining, that's all."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Someone please tell me what is happening to me?" Tiffany wailed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Miss Tick is going to give you the answer in some long words," said Granny. "But they boils down to this: It's the Story happening. It's making you fit into itself."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany tried not to look like someone who didn't understand a word that she had just heard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I could do with a little bit of the fine detail, I think," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I think I'll get some tea brewed," said Nanny Ogg.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith and the Summer Lady…danced. The dance never ended.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Winter never dies. Not as people die. It hangs on in late frost and the smell of autumn in a summer evening, and in the heat it flees to the mountains.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Summer never dies. It sinks into the ground; in the depths, winter buds form in sheltered places and white shoots creep under dead leaves. Some of it flees into the deepest, hottest deserts, where there is a summer that never ends. To animals they were just the weather, just part of everything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But humans arose and gave them names, just as people filled the starry sky with heroes and monsters, because this turned them into stories. And humans loved stories, because once you'd turned things into stories, you could change the stories. And there was the problem, right there.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now the Lady and the Wintersmith danced around the year, changing places in the spring and autumn, and it had worked for thousands of years, right up until the time a girl couldn't control her feet and had arrived in the dance at exactly the wrong time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the Story had life, too. It was like a play now. It would roll on around the year, and if one of the players wasn't the real actress but just some girl who'd wandered onto the stage, well, that was too bad. She'd have to wear the costume and speak the lines and hope that there was going to be a happy ending. Change the Story, even if you don't mean to, and the Story changes you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Tick used a lot more words than this, like "anthropomorphic personification," but this was what ended up in Tiffany's head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So…I'm not a goddess?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, I wish I had a blackboard." Miss Tick sighed. "They really don't survive the water, though, and of course the chalks get so soggy—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What we think happened in the Dance," Granny Weatherwax began in a loud voice, "is that you and the Summer Lady got…mixed up."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mixed up?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You may have some of her talents. The myth of the Summer Lady says that flowers grow wherever she walks," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Where e'er," said Miss Tick primly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What?" snapped Granny, who was now pacing up and down in front of the fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's ‘where e'er she walks,' in fact," said Miss Tick. "It's more…poetical."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hah," Granny said. "Poetry!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Am I going to get into trouble about this? Tiffany wondered. "And what about the real Summer Lady? Is she going to be angry?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax stopped pacing and looked at Miss Tick, who said: "Ah, yes…er…we are exploring every possibility—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That means we don't know," said Granny. "That's the truth of it. This is about gods, see? But yes, since you ask, they can be a bit touchy."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I didn't see her in the dance," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Did you see the Wintersmith?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well…no," said Tiffany. How could she describe that wonderful, endless, golden, spinning moment? It went beyond bodies and thoughts. But it had sounded as though two people had said: "Who are you?" She pulled her boots back on. "Er…where is she now?" she asked as she tied the laces. Perhaps she'd have to run.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's probably gone back underground for the winter. The Summer Lady doesn't walk above ground in winter."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Up until now," said Nanny Ogg cheerfully. She seemed to be enjoying this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aah, Mrs. Ogg has put her finger on the other problem," said Miss Tick. "The, er, Wintersmith and the Summer Lady are, uh, that is, they've never—" She looked imploringly at Nanny Ogg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They've never met except in the Dance," said Nanny. "But now here you are, and you feel like the Summer Lady to him, walking around as bold as brass in the wintertime, so you might be…how shall I put it…?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"…exciting his romantic propensities," said Miss Tick quickly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I wasn't going to describe it quite like that," said Nanny Ogg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, I suspects you weren't!" said Granny. "I suspects you was going to use Language!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany definitely heard the capital "L," which entirely suggested that the language she was thinking of was not to be uttered in polite company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny stood up and tried to look haughty, which is hard to do when you have a face like a happy apple.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I was actually going to draw Tiff's attention to this," she said, taking an ornament off the crowded mantelpiece. It was a little house. Tiffany had glanced at it before; it had two little doorways at the front and, at the moment, a tiny little wooden man with a top hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's called a weather house," Nanny said, handing it to Tiffany. "I don't know how it works—there's a bit of special string or something—but there's a little wooden man who comes out if it's going to rain and a little wooden woman who comes out when it's going to be sunny. But they're on a little pivoty thing, see? They can never be out at the same time, see? Never. An' I can't help wonderin', when the weather's changin', if the little man sees the little woman out of the corner of his eye and wonders—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is this about sex?" asked Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Tick looked at the ceiling. Granny Weatherwax cleared her throat. Nanny gave a huge laugh that would have embarrassed even the little wooden man.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sex?" she said. "Between Summer and Winter? Now there's a thought."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't…think…it," said Granny Weatherwax sternly. She turned to Tiffany. "He's fascinated by you, that's what it is. And we don't know how much of the Summer Lady's power is in you. She might be quite weak. You'll have to be a summer in winter until winter ends," she added flatly. "That's justice. No excuses. You made a choice. You get what you chose."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Couldn't I just go and find her and say I'm sorry—?" Tiffany began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. The old gods ain't big on ‘sorry,'" said Granny, pacing up and down again. "They know it's just a word."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know what I think?" said Nanny. "I think she's watchin' you, Tiff. She's sayin' to herself, ‘Who's this hoity-toity young madam steppin' into my shoes? Well, let's make her walk a mile in 'em and see how she likes it!'"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mrs. Ogg may have something there," said Miss Tick, who was leafing through Chaffinch's Mythology. "The gods expect you to pay for your mistakes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg patted Tiffany's hand. "If she wants to see what you can do, show her what you can do, Tiff, eh? That's the way! Surprise her!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You mean the Summer Lady?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny winked. "Oh, and the Summer Lady, too!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was what sounded very much like the start of a laugh from Miss Tick before Granny Weatherwax glared at her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany sighed. It was all very well to talk about choices, but she had no choice here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right. What else can I expect apart from…well, the feet?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm, er, checking," said Miss Tick, still thumbing through the book. "Ah…it says here that she was, I mean is, fairer than all the stars in heaven…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They all looked at Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You could try doing something with your hair," said Nanny Ogg after a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Like what?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Like anything, really."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Apart from the feet and doing something with my hair," said Tiffany sharply, "is there anything else?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Says here, quoting a very old manuscript: ‘She waketh the grasses in Aprill and filleth the beehives with honey swete,'" Miss Tick reported.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How do I do that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't know, but I suspect that happens anyway," said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the Summer Lady gets the credit?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I think she just has to exist for it to happen, really," said Miss Tick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Anything else?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er, yes. You have to make sure the winter ends," said Miss Tick. "And, of course, deal with the Wintersmith."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And how do I do that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We think that you just have to…be there," said Granny Weatherwax. "Or perhaps you'll know what to do when the time comes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Meep.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Be where?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Everywhere. Anywhere."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Granny, your hat squeaked," said Tiffany. "It went meep!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No it didn't," Granny said sharply.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It did, you know," said Nanny Ogg. "I heard it too."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax grunted and pulled off her hat. The white kitten, curled around her tight bun of hair, blinked in the light.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can't help it," Granny muttered. "If I leave the dratted thing alone, it goes under the dresser and cries and cries." She looked around at the others as if daring them to say anything. "Anyway," she added, "it keeps m' head warm."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On his chair, the yellow slit of Greebo's left eye opened lazily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Get down, You," said Granny, lifting the kitten off her head and putting it on the floor. "I daresay Mrs. Ogg has got some milk in the kitchen."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not much," said Nanny. "I'll swear something's been drinking it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Greebo's eye opened all the way, and he began to growl softly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You sure you know what you're doing, Esme?" said Nanny Ogg, reaching for a cushion to throw. "He's very protective of his territory."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You the kitten sat on the floor and washed her ears. Then, as Greebo got to his feet, she fixed him with an innocent little stare and took a flying leap onto his nose, landing on it with all her claws out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So is she," said Granny Weatherwax, as Greebo erupted from the chair and hurtled around the room before disappearing into the kitchen. There was a crash of saucepans followed by the groioioioing of a saucepan lid spinning into silence on the floor.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The kitten padded back into the room, hopped into the empty chair, and curled up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He brought in half a wolf last week," said Nanny Ogg. "You haven't been hexperimenting</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And no one heard the Wintersmith say: "Sulfur enough to make a man!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg was sitting by the fire when Tiffany came in, stamping snow off her boots.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You look frozen all through," Nanny said. "You need a glass of hot milk with a drop of brandy in it, that's what you need."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ooh, yyess…" Tiffany managed through chattering teeth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Get me one too, then, will you?" said Nanny. "Only joking. You get warmed up; I'll see to the drink."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's feet felt like blocks of ice. She knelt by the fire and stretched out her hand to the stockpot on its big black hook. It bubbled all the time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Get your mind right, and balance. Reach out and cup your hands around it, and concentrate, concentrate, on your freezing boots.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a while her toes felt warm and then—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ow!" Tiffany pulled her hands away and sucked at her fingers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Didn't have your mind right," said Nanny Ogg from the doorway.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, you know, that's just a bit difficult when you've had a long day and you didn't sleep much and the Wintersmith is looking for you," snapped Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The fire doesn't care," said Nanny, shrugging. "Hot milk coming up."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things were a little better when Tiffany had warmed up. She wondered how much brandy Nanny had added to the milk. Nanny had done one for herself, with probably some milk added to the brandy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Isn't this nice and cozy," said Nanny after a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Is this going to be the talk about sex?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Did anyone say there was going to be one?" said Nanny innocently.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I kind of got the feeling," said Tiffany. "And I know where babies come from, Mrs. Ogg."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I should hope so."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I know how they get there, too. I live on a farm and I've got a lot of older sisters."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, right," said Nanny. "Well, I see you're pretty well prepared for life, then. Not much left for me to tell you, I expect. And I've never had a god pay any attention to me, as far as I can recall. Flattered, are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No!" Tiffany looked into Nanny's smile. "Well, a bit," she admitted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And frightened of him?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, the poor thing hasn't quite got it right yet. He started off so well, with the ice roses and everything, and then he wanted to show you his muscles. Typical. But you shouldn't be frightened of him. He should be frightened of you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why? Because I'm pretending to be the flower woman?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Because you're a girl! It's a poor lookout if a bright girl can't wind a boy around her little finger. He's smitten with you. You could make his life a misery with a word. Why, when I was a girl, a young man nearly threw himself off the Lancre Bridge because I spurned his advances!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He did? What happened?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I unspurned 'em. Well, he looked so pretty standing there, and I thought, that's a good-looking bum on him if ever I saw one." Nanny sat back. "And think about poor ol' Greebo. He'll fight anything. But Esme's little white kitten leaped straight at him, and now the poor dear won't come into this room without peering around the door to check that she's not here. You should see his poor little face when he does, too. It's all wrinkled up. O' course, he could tear her into bits with one claw, but he can't now 'cuz she's fixed his head."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You're not saying I should try to tear the Wintersmith's face off, are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, no, you don't have to be as blunt as that. Give him a little hope. Be kind but firm—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He wants to marry me!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That means he wants to stay friendly. Don't say no, don't say yes. Act like a queen. He's got to learn to show you some respect. What are you doing?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Writing this down," said Tiffany, scribbling in her diary.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You don't need to write it down, love," said Nanny. "It's written down in you somewhere. On a page you haven't read yet, I reckon. Which reminds me, these came when you were out." Nanny fished down among the seat cushions and pulled out a couple of envelopes. "My boy Shawn is the postman, so he knew you'd moved."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany nearly snatched them out of her hand. Two letters! "Like him, do you? Your young man in the castle?" said Nanny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's a friend who writes to me," said Tiffany haughtily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's right, that's just the look and voice you need for dealing with the Wintersmith!" said Nanny, looking delighted. "Who does he think he is, daring to talk to you? That's the way!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I shall read them in my room," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny nodded. "One of the girls did us a lovely casserole," she said (famously, Nanny never remembered the names of her daughters-in-law). "Yours is in the oven. I'm off to the pub. Early start tomorrow!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Alone in her room, Tiffany read the first letter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To the unaided eye, not much happened on the Chalk. It had avoided History. It was a place of small things. Tiffany enjoyed reading about them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The second letter seemed to be much the same as the first one—until the bit about the ball. He'd gone to a ball! It was at the house of Lord Diver, who was a neighbor! He'd danced with his daughter, who was called Iodine because Lord Diver thought that was a nice name for a girl! They'd had three dances!! And ice cream!! Iodine had shown him her watercolors!!!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How could he sit there and write such things?!!!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's eyes moved on, over the everyday news like the bad weather and what had happened to old Aggie's leg, but the words didn't enter her head because it was on fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who did he think he was, dancing with another girl?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You danced with the Wintersmith, her Third Thoughts said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All right, but what about the watercolors?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith showed you the snowflakes, said her Third Thoughts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But I was just being polite!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Perhaps he was just being polite, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All right, but I know those aunts, Tiffany thought furiously. They've never liked me, because I'm only a farm girl! And Lord Diver's very rich and his daughter is his only child! They're scheming!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How could he sit there and write as if eating ice cream with another girl was a perfectly normal thing to do! That was as bad as—well, something pretty bad, at least!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As for looking at her watercolors…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He's just a boy you happen to write to, said her Third Thoughts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, well…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, well…what? her Third Thoughts persisted. They were getting on Tiffany's nerves. Your own brains ought to have the decency to be on your side!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just "Yes, well…" okay? she thought angrily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You're not being very sensible about this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, really? Well, I've been sensible all day! I've been sensible for years! I think I'm owed five minutes of being really unreasonably angry, don't you?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There's some casserole downstairs, and you haven't eaten since breakfast, said her Third Thoughts. You'll feel better after you've eaten something.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How can I eat stew when people are looking at watercolors? How dare he look at watercolors!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But her Third Thoughts were right—not that this made things any better. If you're going to be angry and miserable, you might as well be so on a full stomach. She went downstairs and found the casserole in the oven. It smelled good. Nothing but the best for dear ol' Mum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She opened the cutlery drawer for a spoon. The drawer stuck. She rattled it, pulled at it, and swore a few times, but it stayed stuck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes, go ahead," said a voice behind her. "See how much help that is. Don't be sensible and stick your hand under the top and carefully free up the stuck item. Oh no. Rattle and curse, that's the way!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany turned.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a skinny, tired-looking woman standing by the kitchen table. She seemed to be wearing a sheet draped around her and was smoking a cigarette. Tiffany had never seen a woman smoke a cigarette before, but especially never a cigarette that burned with a fat red flame and gave off sparks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who are you, and what are you doing in Mrs. Ogg's kitchen?" Tiffany said sharply.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This time it was the woman who looked surprised.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You can hear me?" she said. "And see me?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!" Tiffany snarled. "And this is a food preparation area, you know!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You're not supposed to be able to see me!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, I'm looking at you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hold on a minute," said the woman, frowning at Tiffany. "You're not just a human, are you…?" She squinted oddly for a moment and then said, "Oh, you're her. Am I right? The new Summer?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Never mind me, who are you?" said Tiffany. "And it was only one dance!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Anoia, Goddess of Things That Get Stuck in Drawers," said the woman. "Pleased to meet you." She took another puff at the flaming cigarette, and there were more sparks. Some of them dropped on the floor but didn't seem to do any damage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There's a goddess just for that?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, I find lost corkscrews and things that roll under furniture," said Anoia offhandedly. "Sometimes things that get lost under sofa cushions, too. They want me to do stuck zippers, and I'm thinking about that. But mostly I manifest whensoever people rattle stuck drawers and call upon the gods." She puffed on her cigarette. "Got any tea?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But I didn't call on anyone!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You did," said Anoia, blowing more sparks. "You cussed. Sooner or later, every curse is a prayer." She waved the hand that wasn't holding the cigarette and something in the drawer went pling. "It'll be all right now. It was the egg slicer. Everyone has one, and no one knows why. Did anyone in the world ever knowingly go out one day and buy an egg slicer? I don't think so."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany tried the drawer. It slid out easily.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"About that tea?" said Anoia, sitting down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany put the kettle on. "You know about me?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes," said Anoia. "It's been quite some time since a god fell in love with a mortal. Everyone wants to see how it turns out."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Fell in love?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And you mean the gods are watching?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, of course," said Anoia. "Most of the big ones don't do anything else these days! But I'm supposed to do zippers, oh yes, and my hands get very stiff in this weather!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany glanced at the ceiling, which was now full of smoke.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They're watching all the time?" she said, aghast.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I heard you're getting more interest than the war in Klatchistan, and that was pretty popular," said Anoia, holding out her red hands. "Look, chilblains. Not that they care, of course."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Even when I'm having a…wash?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The goddess laughed nastily. "Yes. And they can see in the dark, too. Best not to think about it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany looked up at the ceiling again. She had been hoping for a bath tonight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll try not to," she said darkly, and added: "Is it…hard, being a goddess?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It has its good days," said Anoia. She stood with her cigarette arm cupped at the elbow by her other hand, holding the flaming, sparking thing close to her face. Now she took a sharp pull, raised her head, and blew a cloud of smoke out to join the smog on the ceiling. Sparks fell out of it like rain. "I haven't been doing drawers long. I used to be a volcano goddess."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really?" said Tiffany. "I'd never have guessed."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes. It was good work, apart from the screaming," said Anoia, and then added in a bitter tone of voice: "Ha! And the god of storms was always raining on my lava. That's men for you, dear. They rain on your lava."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And look at watercolors," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Anoia's eyes narrowed. "Someone else's watercolors?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Men! They're all the same," said Anoia. "Take my advice, dear, and show Mr. Wintersmith the door. He's only an elemental, after all."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany glanced at the door.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Give him the boot, dear, send him packing and change the locks. Let's have summer all year round like the hot countries do. Grapes all over the place, eh? Coconuts on every tree! Hah, when I was in the volcano game, I couldn't move for mangoes. Kiss good-bye to snow and fog and slush. Have you got the thingy yet?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The thingy?" said Tiffany, looking worried.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It'll turn up, I daresay," said Anoia. "I hear it can be a bit tricky to—Oops, I hear rattling, must fly, don't worry, I won't tell him where you are—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She vanished. So did the smoke.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Not knowing what else to do, Tiffany ladled out a plate of hearty meat and vegetables and ate it. So…she could see gods now? And they knew about her? And everyone wanted to give her advice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was not a good idea to come to the attention of those in high places, her father had said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But it was impressive. In love with her, eh? And telling everyone? But he was really an elemental, not a proper god at all. All he knew was how to move wind and water around!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even so…huh. Some people have elementals running after them! Oh yes! How about that? If people were stupid enough to dance around with girls who painted watercolors to lead honest men to their Doom, well, she could be haughty to people who were almost gods. She ought to mention that in a letter, except that of course she wasn't going to be writing to him now. Hah!</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">And a few miles away Old Mother Blackcap, who made her own soap out of animal fat and potash made, indeed, from plant ashes, felt a bar of soap snatched from her hand just as she was about to boil some sheets. The tub of water froze solid, too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Being a witch, she immediately said: "There's a strange thief about!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the Wintersmith said: "Potash enough to make a man!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
    
    
     
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <div class="paragraph">That night, after Nanny Ogg had gone to bed, Tiffany did have the bath she'd been looking forward to. This was not something to be taken lightly. First, the tin bath had to be fetched from its hook on the back of the privy, which was at the bottom of the garden, and dragged through the dark, freezing night to a place of honor in front of the fire. Then kettles had to be heated over the fire and on the black kitchen stove, and getting even six inches of warm water was an effort. Afterward, the water all had to be scooped out and into the sink and the bath moved into a corner, ready to be taken outside in the morning. When you had to do all that, you might as well scrub every inch.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany did one extra thing: She wrote PRIVATE!! on a piece of cardboard and wedged it in the hanging lamp in the center of the room so that it could be read only from above. She wasn't sure it would put off any inquisitive gods, but she felt better for doing it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That night she slept without dreaming. In the morning snow had put a fresh coating on the drifts, and a couple of Nanny Ogg's grandchildren were building her a snowman on the lawn. They came in after a while and demanded a carrot for the nose and two lumps of coal for the eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny took her to the isolated village of Slice, where people were always glad and surprised to see someone they weren't related to. Nanny Ogg ambled from cottage to cottage along the paths cut in the snow, drinking enough cups of tea to float an elephant and doing witchcraft in small ways. Mostly it seemed to just consist of gossip, but once you got the hang of it, you could hear the magic happening. Nanny Ogg changed the way people thought, even if it was only for a few minutes. She left people thinking they were slightly better people. They weren't, but as Nanny said, it gave them something to live up to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then there was another night without dreams, but Tiffany woke up with a snap at half past five, feeling…odd.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She rubbed the frost off the window and saw the snowman by moonlight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Why do we do it? she wondered. As soon as there's snow, we build snowmen. We do worship the Wintersmith, in a way. We make the snow human…. We give him coal eyes and a carrot nose to bring him alive. Oh, and I see the children gave him a scarf. That's what a snowman needs, a scarf to keep him warm….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She went down into the silent kitchen, and for want of anything else to do she scrubbed the table. Doing something with her hands helped her think.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something had changed, and it was her. She'd been worrying about what he would do and what he would think, as if she were just a leaf being blown about by the wind. She dreaded hearing his voice in her head, where he had no right to be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, not now. Not anymore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He ought to be worried about her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, she'd made a mistake. Yes, it was her fault. But she wasn't going to be bullied. You couldn't let boys go around raining on your lava and ogling other people's watercolors.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Find the story, Granny Weatherwax always said. She believed that the world was full of story shapes. If you let them, they controlled you. But if you studied them, if you found out about them…you could use them, you could change them….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason had known all about stories, yes? She'd spun them like a spiderweb, to give herself power. And they worked because people wanted to believe them. And Nanny Ogg told a story, too. Fat, jolly Nanny Ogg, who liked a drink (and another drink, thank you kindly) and was everyone's favorite grandmother…but those twinkling little eyes could bore into your head and read all your secrets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Even Granny Aching had a story. She'd lived in the old shepherding hut, high on the hills, listening to the wind blowing over the turf. She was mysterious, alone—and the stories floated up and gathered around her, all those stories about her finding lost lambs even though she was dead, all those stories about her, still, watching over people….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People wanted the world to be a story, because stories had to sound right and they had to make sense. People wanted the world to make sense.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, her story wasn't going to be the story of a little girl who got pushed around. There was no sense in that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Except…he's not actually bad. The gods in the Mythology, they seemed to get the hang of being human—a bit too human, sometimes—but how could a snowstorm or a gale ever find out? He was dangerous and scary—but you couldn't help feeling sorry for him….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Someone hammered on Nanny Ogg's back door. It turned out to be a tall figure in black.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wrong house," said Tiffany. "No one here is even a bit sick."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A hand raised the black hood, and from its depths a voice hissed: "It's me, Annagramma! Is she in?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mrs. Ogg's not up yet," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good. Can I come in?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At the kitchen table, over a cup of warming tea, Annagramma revealed all. Life in the woods was not going well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Two men came to see me about some stupid cow they both think they own!" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That'll be Joe Broomsocket and Shifty Adams. I left you a note about them, too," said Tiffany. "Whenever one or other of them gets drunk, they argue about that cow."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What am I supposed to do about it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nod and smile. Wait until the cow dies, Miss Treason always said. Or one of the men," said Tiffany. "It's the only way."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And a woman came to see me with a sick pig!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What did you do about it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I told her I don't do pigs! But she burst into tears, so I tried Bangle's Universal Nostrum on it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You used that on a pig?" said Tiffany, shocked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, the pig witch uses magic, so I don't see why—" Annagramma began defensively.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She knows what works!" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It was perfectly all right when I got it down out of the tree! She didn't have to make all that fuss! I'm sure the bristles will grow back! In time!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It wasn't a spotted pig, was it? And a woman with a squint?" Tiffany asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes! I think so! Does it matter?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mrs. Stumper is very attached to that pig," said Tiffany reproachfully. "She brings him up to the cottage about once a week. It's usually just an upset stomach. She feeds him too much."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really? Then I won't open the door to her next time," said Annagramma firmly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, let her in. Really, it's all because she's lonely and wants to chat."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, I should think I've got better things to do with my time than listen to an old lady who just wants to talk," said Annagramma indignantly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany looked at her. Where did you start, apart from banging the girl's head on the table until the brain started working?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Listen very carefully," she said. "I mean to her, not just to me. You've got no better use of your time than to listen to old ladies who want to talk. Everyone tells things to witches. So listen to everyone and don't say much and think about what they say and how they say it and watch their eyes…. It becomes like a big jigsaw puzzle, but you're the only one who can see all the pieces. You'll know what they want you to know, and what they don't want you to know, and even what they think no one knows. That's why we go around the houses. That's why you will go around the houses, until you're part of their lives."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All this just to get some power over a crowd of farmers and peasants?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany spun around and kicked a chair so hard that it broke a leg. Annagramma backed away quickly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What did you do that for?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You're clever—you guess!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, I forgot…your father is a shepherd…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good! You remembered!" Tiffany hesitated. Certainty was pouring into her brain, courtesy of her Third Thoughts. Suddenly she knew Annagramma.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And your father?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What?" Annagramma instinctively drew herself up. "Oh, he owns several farms—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Liar!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, perhaps I should say he is a farmer—" the girl began, nervousness beginning to show.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Liar!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma backed away. "How dare you talk to me like—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How dare you not tell me the truth!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the pause that opened, Tiffany heard everything—the faint crackle of wood in the stove, the sound of mice in the cellar, her own breathing roaring like the sea in a cave….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He works for a farmer, all right?" said Annagramma quickly, and then looked shocked at her own words. "We don't have any land, we don't even own the cottage. There's the truth, if you want it. Happy now?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. But thank you," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you going to tell the others?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. It doesn't matter. But Granny Weatherwax wants you to make a mess of all this, do you understand? She's got nothing against you…" Tiffany hesitated, then went on, "I mean, nothing more than she has against everyone. She just wants people to see that Mrs. Earwig's style of witchcraft doesn't work. This is just like her! She's not said a word against you, she's just let you have exactly what you wanted. It's like a story. Everyone knows that if you get exactly what you wish for, it all goes bad. And you wished for a cottage. And you're going to mess it up."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I just need another day or two to get the hang—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why? You're a witch with a cottage. You're supposed to be able to deal with it! Why take it on if you couldn't do it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You're supposed to be able to deal with it, sheep girl! Why take it on if you couldn't do it?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So you're not going to help me?" Annagramma glared at Tiffany, and then her expression, most unusually, softened a bit and she said, "Are you all right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany blinked. It's horrible to have your own voice echo back at you from the other side of your mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Look, I haven't got time," she said weakly. "Maybe the others can…help out?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't want them to know!" Panic cut curves on Annagramma's face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She can do magic, Tiffany thought. She's just not good at witchcraft. She'll make a mess of it. She'll make a mess of people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She gave in. "All right, I can probably spare some time. There's not many chores to do at Tir Nani Ogg. And I'll explain things to the others. They'll have to know. They'll probably help. You learn fast—you could pick up the basic stuff in a week or so."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany watched Annagramma's face. She was actually thinking about it! If she were drowning and you threw her a rope, she'd complain if it was the wrong color….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, if they are just helping me…" Annagramma said, brightening up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You could almost admire the girl for the way she could rearrange the real world in her head. Another story, thought Tiffany; it's all about Annagramma.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, we'll be helping you." She sighed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Perhaps we could even tell people that you girls are coming to me to learn things?" said Annagramma hopefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People said that you should always count up to ten before losing your temper. But if it was Annagramma you were dealing with, you had to know some bigger numbers, like perhaps a million.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No," said Tiffany, "I don't think we'll do that. You are the one doing the learning."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma opened her mouth to argue, saw the look on Tiffany's face, and decided not to.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er, yes," she said. "Of course. Er…thank you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That was a surprise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They probably will help," said Tiffany. "It won't look good if one of us fails."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To her amazement, the girl really was crying. "It's just that I didn't really think they were my friends…."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <div class="paragraph">"I don't like her," said Petulia, who was knee-deep in pigs. "She calls me the pig witch."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, you are a pig witch," said Tiffany, who was standing outside the pigpen. The big shed was full of pigs. The noise was nearly as bad as the smell. Fine snow, like dust, was falling outside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, but when she says it, there's a good deal too much pig and not enough witch," said Petulia. "Every time she opens her mouth, I think I've done something wrong." She waved a hand in a pig's face and muttered a few words. The animal's eyes crossed and it opened its mouth. It got a large dose of green liquid from a bottle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We can't just leave her to struggle," said Tiffany. "People might get hurt."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, that wouldn't be our fault, would it?" said Petulia, dosing another pig. She cupped her hands and shouted over the din to a man at the other end of the pens: "Fred, this lot's done!" Then she climbed out of the pen, and Tiffany saw that she'd got her dress tucked up to her waist and was wearing a pair of heavy leather britches under it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They're making a real fuss this morning," she said. "Sounds like they're getting a bit frisky."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Frisky?" said Tiffany. "Oh…yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Listen, you can hear the boars yelling in their shed," said Petulia. "They can smell the spring."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But it's not even Hogswatch yet!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's the day after tomorrow. Anyway the springtime sleeps under the snow, my dad always says," said Petulia, washing her hands in a bucket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No ums, said Tiffany's Third Thoughts. When she's working, Petulia never says "um." She's certain of things when she's working. She stands up straight. She's in charge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Look, it will be our fault if we can see something wrong and don't do anything about it," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, Annagramma again," said Petulia. She shrugged. "Look, I can go over there maybe once a week after Hogswatch and show her some of the basic stuff. Will that make you happy?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure she'll be grateful."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure she won't be. Have you asked any of the others?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. I thought that if they knew you'd agreed, they probably would, too," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hah! Well, I suppose that at least we can say we tried. You know, I used to think Annagramma was really clever because she knew a lot of words and could do sparkly spells? But show her a sick pig and she's useless!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany told her about Mrs. Stumper's pig and Petulia looked shocked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We can't have that sort of thing," she said. "In a tree? Perhaps I'll try to drop in this afternoon then." She hesitated. "You know Granny Weatherwax won't be happy about this? Do we want to be caught between her and Mrs. Earwig?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are we doing the right thing or not?" said Tiffany. "Anyway, what's the worst she could do to us?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Petulia gave a short laugh with no humor in it at all. "Well," she said, "first, she could make our—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She won't."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I wish I was as sure as you," said Petulia. "All right, then. For Mrs. Stumper's pig."</div>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Tiffany flew above the treetops, and the occasional high twig brushed against her boots. There was just enough winter sunshine to make the snow crisp and glittery, like a frosted cake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It had been a busy morning. The coven hadn't been very interested in helping Annagramma. The coven itself seemed a long time ago. It had been a busy winter.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All we did was muck about while Annagramma bossed us around," Dimity Hubbub had said, while grinding minerals and very carefully tipping them, a bit at a time, into a tiny pot being heated by a candle. "I'm too busy to mess around with magic. It never did anything useful. You know her trouble? She thinks you can be a witch by buying enough things."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She just needs to learn how to deal with people," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At this point, the pot exploded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, I think we can safely say that wasn't your everyday toothache cure," said Dimity, picking bits of pot out of her hair. "All right, I can spare the odd day, if Petulia's doing it. But it won't do much good."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lucy Warbeck was lying full length and fully clothed in a tin bath full of water when Tiffany came by. Her head was all the way under the surface, but when she saw Tiffany peering in, she held up a sign saying I'M NOT DROWNING! Miss Tick had said she would make a good witch finder, so she was training hard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't see why we should help Annagramma," she said as Tiffany helped her get dry. "She just likes putting people down with that sarcastic voice of hers. Anyway, what's it to you? You know she doesn't like you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I thought we've always got on…more or less," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really? You can do stuff she can't even attempt! Like that thing where you go invisible…you do it and you make it look easy! But you come along to the meetings and act like the rest of us and help clear up afterward, and that drives her mad!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Look, I don't understand what you're going on about."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lucy picked up another towel. "She can't stand the idea that someone's better than her but doesn't crow about it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why should I do that?" said Tiffany, bewildered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Because that's what she'd do, if she was you," said Lucy, carefully pushing the knife and fork back into her piled-up hair.</div>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">It was much colder the next morning, a numb dull coldness that could practically freeze the flames on a fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany let the broomstick settle between the trees a little way from Nanny Ogg's cottage. The snow hadn't drifted much here, but it came up to her knees, and cold had put a crispness on it that crackled like a stale loaf when Tiffany trod it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In theory she was out in the woods to get the hang of the Cornucopia, but really she was there to keep it out of the way. Nanny Ogg hadn't been too upset about the chickens. After all, she now owned five hundred hens, which were currently standing around in her shed going werk. But the floors were a mess, there were chicken doo-dahs even on the banisters, and as Granny had pointed out (in a whisper), supposing someone had said "sharks"?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Cornucopia lay on her lap while she sat on a stump among snow-covered trees. Once the forest had been pretty. Now it was hateful. Dark trunks against snowdrifts, a striped world of black and white, bars against the light. She longed for horizons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Funny…the Cornucopia was always very slightly warm, even out here, and seemed to know in advance what size it ought to be. "I grow, I shrink," thought Tiffany. And I'm feeling pretty small.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What next? What now? She'd kept hoping that the…the power would drop on her, just like the Cornucopia had done. It hadn't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was life under the snow. She felt it in her fingertips. Somewhere down there, out of reach, was the real Summer. Using the Cornucopia as a scoop, she scraped away at the snow until she reached dead leaves. There was life down there in the white webs of fungi and pale, new roots. A half-frozen worm crawled slowly away and burrowed under a leaf skeleton, fine as lace. Beside it was an acorn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The woods weren't silent. They were holding their breath. They were all waiting for her, and she didn't know what to do.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'm not the Summer Lady, she told herself. I can never be her. I'm in her shoes, but I can never be her. I might be able to make a few flowers grow, but I can never be her. She'll walk across the world and oceans of sap will rise in these dead trees and a million tons of grass will grow in a second. Can I do that? No. I'm a stupid child with a handful of tricks, that's all. I'm just Tiffany Aching, and I'm aching to go home.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Feeling guilty about the worm, she breathed some warm air on the soil and then pushed the leaves back to cover it. As she did so, there was a wet little sound, like the snapping of a frog's fingers, and the acorn split. A white shoot escaped from it and grew more than half an inch as she watched it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hurriedly she made a hole in the mold with her fingers, pushed the acorn in, and patted the soil back again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Someone was watching her. She stood up and turned around quickly. There was no one to be seen, but that didn't mean a thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I know you're there!" she said, still turning around. "Whoever you are!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her voice echoed among the black trees. Even to her it sounded thin and scared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She found herself raising the Cornucopia.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Show yourself," she quavered, "or—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What? she wondered. I'll fill you full of fruit?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Some snow fell off a tree with a thump, making her jump and then feel even more foolish. Now she was flinching at the fall of a handful of snowflakes! A witch ought never to be frightened in the darkest forest, Granny Weatherwax had once told her, because she should be sure in her soul that the most terrifying thing in the forest was her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She raised the Cornucopia and said, half-heartedly: "Strawberry…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something shot out of the Cornucopia with a pfut and made a red stain on a tree twenty feet away. Tiffany didn't bother to check; it always delivered what you asked for.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Which was more than she could say for herself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And on top of everything else, it was her day to visit Annagramma. Tiffany sighed deeply. She'd probably get that wrong too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly, astride her broomstick, she disappeared among the trees.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a minute or two, a green shoot thrust up from the patch of soil that she had breathed on, grew to a height of about six inches, and put out two green leaves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Footsteps approached. They were not as crunchy as footsteps on frozen snow usually are.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a crunch now, though, of someone kneeling on the frosted leaves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A pair of skinny but powerful hands gently dragged and sculpted the snow and leaves together to make a tall, thin wall around the shoot, enclosing it and protecting it from the wind like a soldier in a castle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A small white kitten tried to nuzzle at it and was carefully lifted out of the way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then Granny Weatherwax walked back into the woods, leaving no footprints. You never teach anyone else everything you know.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Days went by. Annagramma learned, but it was a struggle. It was hard to teach someone who wouldn't admit that there was anything she didn't know, so there were conversations like this:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know how to prepare placebo root, do you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Of course. Everyone knows that." And this was not the time to say, "Okay then, show me," because she'd mess around for a while and then say she had a headache. This was the time to say, "Good, watch me to see if I'm doing it right," and then do it perfectly. And you'd add things like: "As you know, Granny Weatherwax says that practically anything works instead of placebo root, but it's best to use the real thing if you can get it. If prepared in syrup, it's an amazing remedy for minor illnesses, but of course you already know this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Annagramma would say: "Of course."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A week later, in the forests, it was so cold some older trees exploded in the night. They hadn't seen that for a long time, the older people said. It happened when the sap froze, then tried to expand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma was as vain as a canary in a room full of mirrors and panicked instantly when faced with anything she didn't know, but she was sharp at picking things up, and very good at appearing to know more than she really did, which is a valuable talent for a witch. Once, Tiffany noticed the Boffo catalogue open on the table with some things circled. She asked no questions. She was too busy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A week after that, wells froze.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany went around the villages with Annagramma a few times and knew that she would make it, eventually. She'd got built-in Boffo. She was tall and arrogant and acted as if she knew everything even when she didn't have a clue. That would get her a long way. People listened to her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They needed to. There were no roads open now; between cottages, people had cut tunnels full of cold blue light. Anything that needed to be moved was moved by broomstick. That included old people. They were lifted, bedclothes, walking sticks, and all, and moved into other houses. People packed together stayed warmer, and could pass the time by reminding one another that, however cold this was, it wasn't as cold as the cold you got when they were young.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a while, they stopped saying that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it would thaw, just a little, and then freeze again. That fringed every roof with icicles. At the next thaw, they stabbed the ground like daggers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany didn't sleep; at least, she didn't go to bed. None of the witches did. The snow got trampled down into ice that was like rock, so a few carts could be moved about, but there still weren't enough witches to go around or enough hours in the day. There weren't enough hours in the day and the night put together. Petulia had fallen asleep on her stick and ended up in a tree two miles away. Tiffany slid off once and landed in a snowdrift.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Wolves entered the tunnels. They were weak with hunger, and desperate. Granny Weatherwax put a stop to them and never told anyone how she'd done it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cold was like being punched, over and over again, day and night. All over the snow were little dark dots that were dead birds, frozen out of the air. Other birds had found the tunnels and filled them with twittering, and people fed them scraps because they brought a false hope of spring to the world…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…because there was food. Oh, yes, there was food. The Cornucopia ran day and night.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Tiffany thought: I should have said no to snowflakes….</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a shack, old and abandoned. And there was, in the rotted planks, a nail. If the Wintersmith had had fingers, they would have been shaking.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This was the last thing! There had been so much to learn! It had been so hard, so hard! Who would have thought a man was made of stuff like chalk and soot and gases and poisons and metals? But now ice formed under the rusty nail, and the wood groaned and squeaked as the ice grew and forced it out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It spun gently in the air, and the voice of the Wintersmith could be heard in the wind that froze the treetops: "IRON ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">High up in the mountains the snow exploded. It mounded up into the air as if dolphins were playing under it, shapes forming and disappearing….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then, as suddenly as it had risen, the snow settled again. But now there was a horse there, white as snow, and on its back a rider, glittering with frost. If the greatest sculptor the world had ever known had been told to build a snowman, this is what it would have looked like.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something was still going on. The shape of the horse and man still crawled with movement as they grew more and more lifelike. Details settled. Colors crept in, always pale, never bright.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there was a horse, and there was a rider, shining in the comfortless light of the midwinter sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith extended a hand and flexed his fingers. Color is, after all, merely a matter of reflection; the fingers took on the color of flesh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith spoke. That is, there were a variety of noises, from the roar of a gale to the rattle of the sucking of the surf on a pebble shore after a wrecking storm at sea. Somewhere among them all was a tone that seemed right. He repeated it, stretched it, stirred it around, and turned it into speech, playing with it until it sounded right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He said: "Tasbnlerizwip? Ggokyziofvva? Wiswip? Nananana…Nyip…nap…Ah…. Ah! It is to speak!" The Wintersmith threw back his head and sang the overture to Überwald Winter by the composer Wotua Doinov. He'd overheard it once when driving a roaring gale around the rooftops of an opera house, and had been astonished to find that a human being, nothing more really than a bag of dirty water on legs, could have such a wonderful understanding of snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"SNOVA POXOLODALO!" he sang to the freezing sky.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The only slight error the Wintersmith made, as his horse trotted through the pine trees, was in singing the instruments as well as the voices. He sang, in fact, the whole thing, and rode like a traveling orchestra, making the sounds of the singers, the drums, and the rest of the orchestra all at once.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To smell the trees! To feel the pull of the ground! To be solid! To feel the darkness behind your eyes and know it was you! To be—and know yourself to be—a man!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He had never felt like this before. It was exhilarating. There was so much of…of everything, coming at him from every direction. The thing with the ground, for example. It tugged, all the time. Standing upright took a lot of thinking about. And the birds! The Wintersmith had always seen them as nothing more than impurities in the air, interfering with the flow of the weather, but now they were living things just like him. And they played with the tug of the wind, and owned the sky.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith had never seen before, never felt before, never heard before. You could not do those things unless you were…apart, in the dark behind the eyes. Before, he hadn't been apart; he'd been a part, a part of the whole universe of tug and pressure, sound and light, flowing, dancing. He'd run storms against mountains forever, but he'd never known what a mountain was until today.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The dark behind the eyes…what a precious thing. It gave you your…you-ness. Your hand, with those laughable waggly things on it, gave you touch; the holes on either side of your head let in sound; the holes at the front let in the wonderful smell. How clever of holes to know what to do! It was amazing! When you were an elemental, everything happened all together, inside and outside, in one big…thing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thing. That was a useful word…thing. Thing was anything the Wintersmith couldn't describe. Everything was…things, and they were exciting.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was good to be a man! Oh, he was mostly made of dirty ice, but that was just better-organized dirty water, after all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes, he was human. It was so easy. It was just a matter of organizing things. He had senses, he could move among humans, he could…search. That was how to search for humans. You became one! It was so hard to do it as an elemental; it was hard even to recognize a human in the churning thing-ness of the physical world. But a human could talk to other humans with the holes for the sound. He could talk to them and they would not suspect!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now that he was human, there would be no going back. King Winter!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All he needed was a queen.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Tiffany woke up because someone was shaking her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tiffany!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd gone to sleep in Nanny Ogg's cottage with her head against the Cornucopia. From somewhere close there was a strange pif noise, like a dry drip. Pale-blue snowlight filled the room.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As she opened her eyes, Granny Weatherwax was gently pushing her back into her chair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You've been sleeping since nine o'clock, my girl," she said. "Time to go home, I think."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany looked around. "I am here, aren't I?" she said, feeling dizzy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, this is Nanny Ogg's house. And this is a bowl of soup—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany woke up. There was a blurry bowl of soup in front of her. It looked…familiar.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"When did you last sleep in a bed?" said a wavering, shadowy figure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany yawned. "What day is this?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tuesday," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mmm…what's a Tuesday?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany woke up for the third time and was grabbed and pulled upright.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There," said the voice of Granny Weatherwax. "This time stay awake. Drink soup. Get warm. You need to go home."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This time Tiffany's stomach took control of a hand and a spoon and, by degrees, Tiffany warmed up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax sat opposite, the kitten You on her lap, watching Tiffany until the soup was gone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I expected too much from you," she said. "I'd hoped that as the days grew longer, you'd find more power. That ain't no fault of yours."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The pif noises were getting more frequent. Tiffany looked down and saw barley dripping out of the Cornucopia. The number of grains increased even as she watched.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You set it on barley before you fell asleep," said Granny. "It slows right down when you're tired. Just as well, really, otherwise we'd have been eaten alive by chickens."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's about the only thing I've got right," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, I don't know. Annagramma Hawkin seems to be showing promise. Lucky in her friends, from what I hears." If Miss Treason had tried to play poker against Granny Weatherwax's face, she would have lost.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The patter of the new grains suddenly became much louder in the silence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Look, I—" Tiffany began.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny sniffed. "I'm sure no one has to explain themselves to me," she said virtuously. "Will you promise me that you'll go home? A couple of coaches got through this morning, and I hear it's not too bad yet, down on the plains. You go back to your Chalk country. You're the only witch they've got."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany sighed. She did want to go home, more than anything. But it would be like running away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It might be like running to," said Granny, picking up her old habit of replying to something that hadn't actually been said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll go tomorrow then," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good." Granny stood up. "Come with me. I wants to show you something."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany followed her through a snow tunnel that came out near the edge of the forest. The snow had been packed down here by people dragging firewood home, and once you got a little way from the edge of the forest, the drifts weren't too bad; a lot of snow hung in the trees, filling the air with cold blue shadows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What are we looking for?" asked Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax pointed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a splash of green in the white and gray. It was young leaves on an oak sapling a couple of feet high. When Tiffany crunched her way through the snow crust and reached out to touch it, the air felt warm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do you know how you managed that?" asked Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Me neither. I couldn't do it. You did, girl. Tiffany Aching."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's just one tree," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, well. You have to start small, with oak trees."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They stared in silence at the tree for a few moments. The green seemed to reflect off the snow around it. Winter stole color, but the tree glowed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And now we've all got things to do," said Granny, breaking the spell. "You, I believe, would normally be heading for Miss Treason's old place about now. I'd expect no less of you…."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was a coaching inn. It was busy, even at this time in the morning. The Fast Mail coach had made a quick stop for fresh horses after the long haul into the mountains, and another one, bound for down on the plains, was waiting for the passengers. The breath of horses filled the air with steam. Drivers stamped their feet. Sacks and packages were being loaded. Men bustled around with nosebags. Some bandy-legged men just hung around, smoking and gossiping. In fifteen minutes the inn's yard would be empty again, but for now everyone was too busy to pay much attention to one more stranger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Afterward they all told different stories, contradicting one another at the tops of their voices. Probably the most accurate account came from Miss Dymphnia Stoot, the innkeeper's daughter, who was helping her father serve breakfast:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, he, like, came in, and right there I could see he was odd. He walked funny, you know, lifting his legs like a trotting horse does. Also, he was kind of like shiny. But we get all sorts here, and it does not pay to make pers'nal remarks. We had a bunch of werewolves in here last week and they were just like you and me except we had to put their plates on the floor…. All right, yes, this man…well, he sat down at a table and said: ‘I am a human just like you!' He came out with it, just like that!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Of course, no one else paid attention, but I told him I was glad to hear it and what did he want to eat, because the sausages was particular fine this morning, and he said he could only eat cold food, which was funny 'cuz everyone was grumbling about how cold it was in the room now, and it's not like there wasn't a big fire burning. Anyway…actually we did have some cold sausage left in the pantry and they were a bit on the turn, if you know what I mean, so I gave them to him, and he chewed one for a bit and then he says, with his mouth full if you please, ‘This is not what I expected. What do I do now?' and I said you swallow and he said, ‘Swallow?' and I said, yes, you swallow it down into your stomach, right, and he said, spraying bits of sausage all over the place, ‘Oh, a hollow bit!' and sort of like wavers and then he says, ‘Ah, I am a human. I have successfully eaten human sausages!' and I said there was no need to be like that, they were made of mostly pig, same as always.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then he says what is he supposed to do with them now and I says it's not my place to tell him and that will be two pennies please and he puts down a gold coin so I curtsy because, well, you never know. Then he says, ‘I am a human just like you. Where are the pointy humans who fly through the sky?' which was a funny way of putting it to my mind, but I told him if it was witches he wanted, there was plenty of 'em over the Lancre Bridge, and he said, ‘Name of Treason?' and I said I heard she was dead but with witches who can say. And off he went. All the time he had this, like, smile, all shiny and a bit worrying. Something wrong with his clothes, too, like they were stuck to him or something. But you can't be too choosy in this business. We had some trolls in here yesterday. They can't eat our food, you know, being kind of like walking rocks, but we gave them a slap-up meal of broken cups and grease. But he was a rum 'un. The place got a lot warmer after he left, too."</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The words kept Tiffany warm as she flew over the trees. The fire in her head burned with pride but contained one or two big crackly logs of anger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny had known! Had she planned it? Because it looked good, didn't it? All the witches would know. Mrs. Earwig's pupil couldn't cope, but Tiffany Aching organized all the other girls to help out and didn't tell anyone. Of course, among witches, not telling anyone was a sure way of getting things found out. Witches were very good at listening to what you weren't saying. So Annagramma held on to her cottage, and Mrs. Earwig was embarrassed and Granny would be smug. All that work and rushing around, to let Granny feel smug. Well, and for Mrs. Stumper's pig and everyone else, of course. That made it complicated. If you could, you did what needed to be done. Poking your nose in was basic witchcraft. She knew it. Granny knew she knew it. So Tiffany had scurried around like a little clockwork mouse….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There would be a reckoning!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The clearing was full of snow in great icy drifts, but a path had been worn to the cottage, she was pleased to see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was something new. There were people standing by Miss Treason's grave, and some of the snow had been scraped off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh no, Tiffany thought as she circled down, please say she hasn't gone looking for the skulls!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It turned out to be, in some ways, worse.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She recognized the people around the grave. They were villagers, and they gave Tiffany the defiant, worried stares of people scared half to death by the small but possibly angry pointy hat in front of them. And there was something about the very deliberate way they weren't looking at the mound that instantly drew her attention to it. It was covered in little torn scraps of paper, pinned down with sticks. They fluttered in the wind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She snatched up a couple:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason please keep my boy Joe save at see.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss treason, Im goin bald pleas help.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Miss Treason, please find our Girl Becky what run away Im sorry.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were more. And just as she was about to speak sharply to the villagers for still bothering Miss Treason, she remembered the packets of Jolly Sailor tobacco that the shepherds even now left on the turf where the old shepherding hut had been. They didn't write their petitions down, but they were there all the same, floating in the air:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Granny Aching, who herds the clouds in the blue sky, please watch my sheep." "Granny Aching, cure my son." "Granny Aching, find my lambs."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They were the prayers of small people, too afraid to bother the gods in their high places. They trusted in what they knew. They weren't right or wrong. They were just…hopeful.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, Miss Treason, she thought, you're a myth now, as sure as anything. You might even make it to goddess. It's not much fun, I can tell you.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And has Becky been found?" she said, turning to the people.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A man avoided her gaze as he said: "I reckon Miss Treason'll understand why the girl won't be wantin' to come home anytime soon."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Oh, thought Tiffany, one of those reasons.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Any news of the boy, then?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, that one worked," said a woman. "His mum got a letter yesterday sayin' he'd been in a dreadful shipwreck but was picked up alive, which only goes to show."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany didn't ask what it was that it went to show. It was enough that it had gone to show it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, that's good," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But lots of poor seamen got drownded," the woman went on. "They hit an iceberg in the fog. A big floating mountain of ice shaped like a woman, they said. What d'you think of that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I expect if they'd been at sea long enough, anything would look like a woman, eh?" said the man, and chuckled. The women gave him a Look.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He didn't say who she—if she looked like, you know…anyone?" said Tiffany, trying to sound nonchalant.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Depends where they were looking—" the man began cheerfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You ought to wash your brain out with soap and water," said the woman, prodding him sharply in the chest.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er, no, miss," he said, looking down at his feet. "He just said her head was all covered with seagull—poo, miss."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This time, Tiffany tried not to sound relieved. She looked down at the fluttering bits of paper on the grave and back to the woman, who was trying to hide what might be a fresh request behind her back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do you believe in this stuff, Mrs. Carter?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The woman suddenly looked flustered. "Oh no, miss, of course not. But it's just that…well, you know…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It makes you feel better, thought Tiffany. It's something you can do when there's nothing more to be done. And who knows, it might work. Yes, I know. It's—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her hand itched. And now she realized that it had been itching for a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh yes?" she said under her breath. "You dare?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are you all right, miss?" said the man. Tiffany ignored him. A rider was approaching and snow followed after him, spreading and widening behind him like a cloak, soundless as a wish, thick as fog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Without taking her eyes off him, Tiffany reached into her pocket and gripped the tiny Cornucopia. Hah!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She walked forward.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith dismounted from his snow-white horse when it had drawn level with the old cottage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany stopped about twenty feet away, her heart pounding.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"My lady," said the Wintersmith, and bowed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He looked…better, and older.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I warn you! I've got a Cornucopia and I'm not afraid to use it!" said Tiffany. But she hesitated. He did look almost human, except for that fixed, strange grin. "How did you find me?" she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"For you I have learned," said the figure. "I learned how to search. I am human!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Really? But his mouth doesn't look right, said her Third Thoughts. It's pale inside, like snow. That's not a boy there. It just thinks it is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">One big pumpkin, her Second Thoughts urged. They get really hard at this time of year. Shoot him now!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany herself, the one on the outside, the one who could feel the air on her face, thought: I can't just do that! All he's doing is standing there talking. All this is my fault!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He wants never-ending winter, said her Third Thoughts. Everyone you know will die!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She was sure the eyes of the Wintersmith could see right into her mind.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The summer kills the winter, the Third Thoughts insisted. That's how it works!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But not like this, Tiffany thought. I know it's not supposed to be like this! It feels wrong. It's not the right…story. The king of winter can't be killed by a flying pumpkin!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith was watching her carefully. Thousands of Tiffany-shaped flakes were falling around him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We will finish the Dance now?" he said. "I am human, just like you!" He held out a hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Do you know what human is?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes! Easy! Iron enough to make a nail!" said the Wintersmith promptly. He beamed, as if he'd done a trick successfully. "And now, please, we dance…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He took a step forward. Tiffany backed away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If you dance now, her Third Thoughts warned, that will be the end of it. You'll be believing in yourself and trusting in your star, and big twinkly things thousands of miles up in the sky don't care if they twinkle on everlasting snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm…not ready," Tiffany said, hardly above a whisper.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But time is passing," said the Wintersmith. "I am human, I know these things. Are you not a goddess in human form?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The eyes bored into her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No, I'm not, she thought. I'll always be just…Tiffany Aching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith drew closer, his hand still outstretched.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Time to dance, Lady. Time to finish the Dance."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thoughts leaked out away from Tiffany's grasp. The eyes of the Wintersmith filled her mind with nothing but whiteness, like a field of pure snow….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aaaiiiiieeeee!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The door of old Miss Treason's cottage flew open and…something came out, staggering through the snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a witch. You could not mistake it. She—it was probably a she, but some things are so horrible that worrying about how to address a letter to them is silly—had a hat with a point that curled like a snake. It was on top of dripping strands of mad, greasy hair, which were perched on a nightmare of a face. It was green, like the hands that waved black fingernails that were really terrible claws.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany stared. The Wintersmith stared. The people stared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As the horrible screaming, lurching thing drew nearer, the details got clearer, like the brown rotting teeth and the warts. Lots of warts. Even the warts on the warts had warts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma had sent off for everything. Part of Tiffany wanted to laugh, even now, but the Wintersmith snatched at her hand—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">—and the witch grabbed his shoulder.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't you take hold of her like that! How dare you! I'm a witch, you know!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma's voice wasn't easy on the ear at the best of times, but when she was frightened or angry, it had a whine that bored right into the head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Let go of her, I say," screamed Annagramma. The Wintersmith looked stunned. Having to listen to Annagramma in a rage was hard for someone who hadn't had ears for very long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Let her go," she yelled. Then she threw a fireball.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She missed. Possibly she meant to. A ball of flaming gas whizzing nearby usually makes most people stop what they are doing. But most people don't melt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith's leg dropped off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Later, on the journey through the blizzard, Tiffany wondered how the Wintersmith worked. He was made of snow, but he could make it walk and talk. That must mean he had to think about it all the time. He had to. Humans didn't have to think about their bodies all the time, because their bodies knew what to do. But snow doesn't even know how to stand up straight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma was glaring at him as if he'd done something really annoying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He looked around, as if puzzled, cracks appearing across his chest, and then he was just crumbling snow, collapsing into glittery crystals.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The snow began to pour down now, as if the clouds were being squeezed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Annagramma pulled the mask to one side and stared first at the heap and then at Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right," she said, "what just happened? Was he supposed to do that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I was coming to see you and…that's the Wintersmith!" was all that Tiffany could manage at that point.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You mean like…the Wintersmith?" said Annagramma. "Isn't he just a story? What is he after you for?" she added accusingly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's…he…I…" Tiffany began, but there was nowhere to start. "He's real! I've got to get away from him!" she said. "I've got to get away! It takes too long to explain!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For a horrible moment she thought Annagramma was still going to demand the whole story, but she reached out and grabbed Tiffany's hand with a black rubber claw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then get out of here right now! Oh, no, you've still got Miss Treason's old broom? Totally useless! Use mine!" She dragged Tiffany toward the cottage, as the snowflakes thickened.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"‘Iron enough to make a nail'!" said Tiffany, trying to keep up. She couldn't think of anything else to say, and it was suddenly very important. "He thought he was human—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've only knocked over his snowman, you fool. He'll be back!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, but iron enough, you see, to—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A green hand slapped her face, but this hurt less than it might because of the rubber.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't babble! I thought you were clever! I really don't know what this is about, but if I had that thing after me, I wouldn't stand around babbling!" Annagramma pulled across the Wicked Witch De-Luxe Mask With Free Dangling Booger, adjusted the hang of the booger, and turned to the villagers, who'd been rooted to the spot all this time. "What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a witch before?" she shouted. "Go back home! Oh, and I'll be down tomorrow with some physic for your little boy, Mrs. Carter!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They stared at the green face, the rotted teeth, the stinking hair, and the huge booger, made in fact of glass, and fled.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Still drunk with terror and relief, Tiffany rocked gently, muttering "Iron enough to make a nail!" until Annagramma shook her. The thick flakes were dropping so fast that it was hard to see her face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tiffany, broomstick. Broomstick fly," said Annagramma. "Fly a long way! Do you hear me! Somewhere safe!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But he…the poor thing thinks that…"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, yes, I'm sure it's all very important," said Annagramma, dragging her toward the cottage wall, where her broomstick leaned. She half pushed, half lifted Tiffany onto it and looked up. Snow was pouring out of the sky like a waterfall now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's coming back!" she snapped, and said a few words under her breath. The broomstick shot straight up and disappeared into the fading, snow-filled light.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax looked up from the saucer of ink, in which a tiny Tiffany was disappearing into the whiteness of the blizzard. She was smiling, but with Granny Weatherwax this did not necessarily mean that something nice was happening.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We could ha' taken him doon easy," said Rob Anybody reproachfully. "Ye should ha' let us."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Perhaps. Or perhaps he'd have frozen you solid?" said Granny. "Besides, there's a bigger task ahead of the Nac Mac Feegles. Your big wee hag needs you to do two things. One of them is hard, the other one is very hard."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Feegles cheered up when they heard this. They were everywhere in Mrs. Ogg's kitchen. Some were perched on Nanny Ogg herself, and Miss Tick looked very uncomfortable surrounded by them. Unlike Miss Tick, Feegles rarely had an opportunity for a bath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Firstly," said Granny, "she will need you to go into the…Underworld, to fetch the Summer Lady."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The significant pause did not seem to bother the Feegles at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh aye, we can do that," said Rob Anybody. "We can get into anywhere. An' that's the verra hard bit, is it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And out again?" said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye," said Rob firmly. "Mostly we get thrown oot!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The very hard part," said Granny, "will be finding a Hero."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's no' hard," said Rob. "We're a' heroes here!" A cheer went up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Really?" said Granny. "Are you frightened to go into the Underworld, Rob Anybody?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Me? No!" Rob Anybody looked around at his brothers and grinned hugely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Spell the word ‘marmalade,' then." Granny Weatherwax pushed a pencil across Nanny Ogg's table and sat back in her chair. "Go on. Right now. And no one is to help you!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob backed away. Granny Weatherwax was the hag o' all hags—he knew that. There was no telling what she might do to an errant Feegle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He picked up the pencil nervously, and placed the pointy end against the wood of the table. Other Feegles clustered around, but under Granny's frown no one dared to even cheer him on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob stared upward, his lips moving and sweat beading his forehead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mmmmaa…" he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"One," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob blinked. "Hey? Who's countin'?" he protested.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Me," said Granny. The kitten You leaped onto her lap and curled up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens, ye never said there wuz gonna be countin'!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Didn't I? The rules can change at any time! Two!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob scribbled a passable M, hesitated, and then drew an R just as Granny said "Three!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There's gonna have tae be a ‘A' in there, Rob," said Billy Bigchin. He looked up defiantly at Granny and added: "I heard tell the rules can change at any time, right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Certainly. Five!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob scratched in an A and added another M in a burst of creativity.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Six and a half," said Granny, calmly stroking the kitten.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Whut? Ach, crivens," muttered Rob, and wiped a sweaty hand on his kilt. Then he gripped the pencil again and drew an L. It had a rather wavy foot because the pencil skidded out of his hands and the point broke.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He growled and drew his sword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Eight," said Granny. Wood shavings flew as Rob hacked a rather ragged fresh point out of the pencil.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nine." An A and a D were scribbled by a Rob, whose eyes were now bulging and whose cheeks were red.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ten." Rob stood to attention, looking mostly nervous but slightly proud, beside MRAMLAD. The Feegles cheered, and those nearest to him fanned him with their kilts.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Eleven!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Whut? Crivens!" Rob scurried back to the end of the word and plonked down a small e.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Twelve!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ye can count all ye want tae, mistress," said Rob, flinging down the pencil, "but that's all the marmalade there is!" This got another cheer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An heroic effort, Mr. Anybody," said Granny. "The first thing a hero must conquer is his fear, and when it comes to fightin', the Nac Mac Feegles don't know the meanin' of the word."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, true enough," Rob grunted. "We dinna ken the meanin' o' thousands o' wurds!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Can you fight a dragon?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye, bring it on!" He was still angry about the marmalade.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Run up a high mountain?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Nae problemo!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Read a book to the very end to save your big wee hag?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye." Rob stopped. He looked cornered. He licked his lips. "How many o' them pagey things would that be?" he said hoarsely.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hundreds," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wi' wurds on both sides?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, indeed. In quite small writing!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob crouched. He always did that when he was cornered, the better to come up fighting. The mass of Feegles held their breath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll do it!" he announced grimly, clenching his fists.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good," said Granny. "Of course you would. That would be heroic—for you. But someone must go into the Underworld to find the real Summer Lady. That is a Story. It has happened before. It works. And he must do it in fear and terror like a real Hero should, because a lot of the monsters he must overcome are the ones in his head, the ones he brings in with him. It's time for spring, and winter and its snow is still with us, so you must find him now. You've got to find him and set his feet on the path. The Path That Goes Down, Rob Anybody."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, we ken that path," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"His name is Roland," said Granny. "I reckon you should leave as soon as it is light."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The broomstick barreled through the black blizzard. Sticks usually went where the witches wanted them to go, and Tiffany lay along the broom, tried not to freeze to death, and hoped it was taking her home. She couldn't see anything except darkness and rushing snow that stung her eyes, so she lay with the hat pulled down to streamline the stick. Even so, snowflakes struck her like stones and piled up on the stick. She had to flail around every few minutes to stop things from icing up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She did hear the roar of the falls below and felt the sudden depth of air as the stick glided out over the plains and began to sink. She felt cold to the bone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She couldn't fight the Wintersmith, not like Annagramma could. Oh, she could plan to do it, and go to bed determined, but when she saw him…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…iron enough to make a nail…. The words hung around in her head as the stick flew on and she remembered the old rhyme she'd heard years ago, when the wandering teachers came to the village. Everyone seemed to know it:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Iron enough to make a nail,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lime enough to paint a wall,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Water enough to drown a dog,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sulfur enough to stop the fleas,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Poison enough to kill a cow,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Potash enough to wash a shirt,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Gold enough to buy a bean,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Silver enough to coat a pin,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Lead enough to ballast a bird,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Phosphor enough to light the town,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And on, and on…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a kind of nonsense, the sort that you never remember being taught but always seem to have known. Girls skipped to it, kids dib-dibbed it to see who was O-U-T out.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then one day a traveling teacher, who like all the others would teach for eggs, fresh vegetables, and clean used clothing, found he got more to eat by teaching things that were interesting rather than useful. He talked about how some wizards had once, using very skillful magic, worked out exactly what a human being was made of. It was mostly water, but there were iron and brimstone and soot and a pinch of just about everything else, even a tiny amount of gold, but all cooked up together somehow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It made as much sense to Tiffany as anything else did. But she was certain of this: If you took all that stuff and put it in a big bowl, it wouldn't turn into a human no matter how much you shouted at it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You couldn't make a picture by pouring a lot of paint into a bucket. If you were human, you knew that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith wasn't. The Wintersmith didn't….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He didn't know how the song ended, either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The words went around and around her mind as the borrowed broom plunged onward. At one point Dr. Bustle turned up, with his reedy, self-satisfied voice, and gave her a lecture on the Lesser Elements and how, indeed, humans were made up of nearly all of them but also contained a lot of narrativium, the basic element of stories, which you could detect only by watching the way all the others behaved….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You run, you flee. How do you like this, sheep girl? You stole him from me. Is he all that you hoped for? The voice came out of the air right beside her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't care who you are," muttered Tiffany, too cold to think straight. "Go away…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hours went by. The air down here was a bit warmer, and the snow not so fierce, but the cold still got through, no matter how much clothing you wore. Tiffany fought to stay awake. Some witches could sleep on a broomstick, but she didn't dare try in case she dreamed she was falling and woke up to find that it was true but soon wouldn't be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But now there were lights below, fitful and yellow. It was probably the inn at Twoshirts, an important navigation point.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Witches never stayed at inns if they could help it, because in some areas that could be dangerous, and in any case most of them inconveniently required you to pay them money. But Mrs. Umbridge, who ran the souvenir shop opposite the inn, had an old barn around the back and was what Miss Tick called FTW, or Friendly To Witches. There was even a witch sign, scratched on the barn wall where no one who wasn't looking for it would find it: a spoon, a pointy hat, and one big schoolmistressy checkmark.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A pile of straw had never seemed more wonderful, and inside two minutes Tiffany was inside the straw. At the other end of the little barn Mrs. Umbridge's pair of cows kept the air warm and smelling of fermented grass.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a dark sleep. She dreamed of Annagramma taking off the De-Luxe Mask and revealing her face, and then taking her face off to show Granny Weatherwax's face underneath….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then: Was it worth a dance, sheep girl? You have taken my power and I am weak. The world will become frost. Was it worth a dance?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She sat up in the pitch-black barn and thought she saw a writhing glow in the air, like a snake. Then she fell back into the darkness and dreamed of the Wintersmith's eyes.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
    
    
     
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">Clang-clonk!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany sat bolt upright, straw tumbling off her. But it was only the sound of a handle clanging on the side of a metal pail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Mrs. Umbridge was milking her cows. Pale daylight shone through the cracks in the walls. She looked up when she heard Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, I thought one of my ladies must've arrived in the night," she said. "Want some breakfast, dear?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Please!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany helped the old woman with her buckets, helped make some butter, patted her very old dog, had beans on toast, and then—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I think I've got something here for you," said Mrs. Umbridge, heading for the little counter that was Twoshirts's entire post office. "Now where did I—oh yes…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She handed Tiffany a small bundle of letters and a flat parcel, all held together by an elastic band and covered with dog hairs. She went on talking, but Tiffany barely noticed. There was something about how the carter had broken his leg, poor man, or maybe it was his horse that had broken a leg, poor creature, and one of the blizzards had brought down a lot of trees onto the track, and then the snow had set in so cruelly, dear, that not even a man on foot could get through, and so what with one thing and another the mail to and from the Chalk had been delayed and really there was hardly any of it anyway—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All this was a kind of background buzzing to Tiffany, because the letters were all addressed to her—three from Roland and one from her mother—and so was the parcel. It had a businesslike air, and when opened revealed a sleek black box, which itself opened to reveal—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany had never seen a box of watercolor paints before. She hadn't known that so many colors existed in one place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, a paint box," said Mrs. Umbridge, looking over her shoulder. "That's nice. I had one when I was a girl. Ah, and it's got turquoise in it. That's very expensive, turquoise. That's from your young man, is it?" she added, because old women like to know everything, or a little bit more.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany cleared her throat. In her letters she'd kept right off the whole painful subject of painting. He must have thought she'd like to try it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The colors in her hands gleamed like a trapped rainbow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's a lovely morning," she said, "and I think I'd better go home…."</div>

      <div class="paragraph">On the chilly river just above the thundering Lancre 
        Falls, a tree trunk was moored. Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg stood on a huge, water-worn stone in the middle of the torrent and watched it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The log was covered in Feegles. They all looked cheerful. Admittedly, certain death awaited them, but it did not involve—and this is important—having to spell anything.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know, no man has ever gone over these falls and lived to tell the tale," said Nanny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mr. Parkinson did," said Granny. "Don't you remember? Three years ago?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, yes, he lived, certainly, but he was left with a very bad stutter," said Nanny Ogg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But he wrote it down," said Granny. "He called it ‘My Fall Over the Falls.' It was quite interestin'."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No one actually told a tale," said Nanny. "That is my point."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, weel, we're as light as wee feathers," said Big Yan. "An' the wind blowin' through the kilt keeps a man well aloft, ye ken."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm sure that's a sight to see," said Nanny Ogg.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Are ye all ready?" said Rob Anybody. "Fine! Would ye be so good as to untie yon rope, Mrs. Ogg?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Nanny Ogg undid the knot and gave the log a shove with her foot. It drifted a little way and then got caught by the current.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"‘Row, Row, Row Yer Boat'?" Daft Wullie suggested.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Whut aboot it?" said Rob Anybody as the log began to speed up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why don't we all sing it?" said Daft Wullie. The walls of the canyon were closing in fast now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Okay," said Rob. "After all, it is a pleasin' naut-ickal ditty. And Wullie, ye're tae keep yon cheese away fra' me. I dinna like the way it's lookin' at me."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It hasna got any eyes, Rob," said Wullie meekly, holding on to Horace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, that's whut I mean," said Rob sourly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Horace didna mean tae try an' eat ye, Rob," said Daft Wullie meekly. "An' ye wuz sae nice an' clean when he spat ye oot."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' hoo come ye ken whut name a cheese has?" Rob demanded, as white water began to splash over the log.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He told me, Rob."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye?" said Rob, and shrugged. "Oh, okay. I wouldna argue wi' a cheese."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Bits of ice were bobbing on the river. Nanny Ogg pointed them out to Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All this snow is making the ice rivers move again," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I know."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hope you can trust the stories, Esme," said Nanny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They are ancient stories. They have a life of their own. They long to be repeated. Summer rescued from a cave? Very old," said Granny Weatherwax.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The Wintersmith will chase our girl, though."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny watched the Feegles' log drift around the bend.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes, he will," she said. "And, you know, I almost feel sorry for him."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">And so the Feegles sailed home. Apart from Billy Bigchin they couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, but that minor problem was dwarfed by the major problem, which was that they didn't bother with the idea of singing at the same pitch, or speed, or even with the same words. Also, minor fights soon broke out, as always happened even when Feegles were having fun, and so the sound that echoed among the rocks as the log sped toward the lip of the waterfall went something like:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Rowaarghgently boat ouchgentlydoon boat boat boatiddley boat stream boatlymerrily boatarrgh…CRIVENnnnnns!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And with its cargo of Feegles, the log tipped and disappeared, along with the accompanying song, into the mists.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Tiffany flew over the long whaleback of the Chalk. It was a white whale now, but the snow didn't look too deep here. The bitter winds that blew the snow onto the downs also blew it away. There were no trees and few walls to make it drift.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As she drew nearer to home, she looked down onto the lower, sheltered fields. The lambing pens were already being set up. There was a lot of snow for this time of year—and whose fault was that?—but the ewes were on their own timetable, snow or not. Shepherds knew how bitter the weather could be at lambing; winter never gave in without a fight.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She landed in the farmyard and said a few words to the broomstick. It wasn't hers, after all. It rose again and shot off back to the mountains. A stick can always find its way home, if you know the trick.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were reunions, lots of laughter, a few tears, a general claiming that she had grown like a beanstalk and was already as tall as her mother and all the other things that get said at a time like this.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Apart from the tiny Cornucopia in her pocket, she'd left everything behind—her diary, her clothes, everything. It didn't matter. She hadn't run away, she'd run to, and here she was, waiting for herself. She could feel her own ground under her boots again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She hung the pointy hat behind the door and went and helped the men setting up the pens.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a good day. A bit of sun had managed to leak through the murk. Against the whiteness of the snow all colors seemed bright, as if the fact that they were here gave them some special brilliance. Old harnesses on the stable wall gleamed like silver; even the browns and grays that might once have appeared so drab seemed, now, to have a life of their own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She got out the box of paints and some precious paper and tried to paint what she was seeing, and there was a kind of magic there, too. It was all about light and dark. If you could get down on paper the shadow and the shine, the shape that any creature left in the world, then you could get the thing itself.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She'd only ever drawn with colored chalks before. Paint was so much better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a good day. It was a day just for her. She could feel bits of herself opening up and coming out of hiding again. Tomorrow there would be the chores, and people very nervously coming up to the farm for the help of a witch. If the pain was strong enough, no one worried that the witch who was making it go away was someone you last remembered being two years old and running around with only her undershirt on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tomorrow…might become anything. But today the winter world was full of color.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <div class="paragraph">There was talk of strangeness all across the plains. There was the rowing boat belonging to the old man who lived in a shack just below the waterfall. It rowed itself away so fast, people said, that it skipped over the water like a dragonfly—but there was no one inside it. It was found tied up at Twoshirts, where the river ran under the coach road. But then the overnight mail coach that had been waiting outside the inn ran away by itself, with all the mailbags left behind. The coachman borrowed a horse to give chase and found the coach in the shadow of the Chalk with all the doors open and one horse missing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The horse was returned a couple of days later by a well-dressed young man who said he'd found it wandering. Surprisingly, then, it looked well fed and groomed.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Very, very thick would be the best way to describe the walls of the castle. There were no guards at night, because they locked up at eight o'clock and went home. Instead, there was Old Robbins, who'd once been a guard and was now officially the night watchman, but everyone knew he fell asleep in front of the fire by nine. He had an old trumpet that he was supposed to blow if there was an attack, although no one was entirely sure what this would achieve.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland slept in the Heron 
        Tower because it was up a long flight of steps that his aunts didn't much like climbing. It also had very, very thick walls, and this is just as well, because at eleven o'clock someone stuck a trumpet against his ear and blew on it hard.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He leaped out of bed, got caught in the eiderdown, slipped on a mat that covered the freezing stone floor, banged his head on a cupboard, and managed to light a candle with the third desperately struck match.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">On the little table by his bed was a pair of huge bellows with Old Robbins's trumpet stuck in the business end. The room was empty, except for the shadows.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've got a sword, you know," he said. "And I know how to use it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, ye're deid already," said a voice from the ceiling. "Chopped tae tiny wee pieces in yer bed while ye snored like a hog. Only jokin', ye ken. None of us mean ye any harm." There was some hurried whispering in the darkness of the rafters, and then the voice continued: "Wee correction there, most o' us dinna mean ye any harm. But dinna fash yersel' aboot Big Yan, he disna like anybody verra much."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Who are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, there ye go again, gettin' it all wrong," said the voice conversationally. "I'm up here an' heavily armed, ye ken, while ye're doon there in yer wee nightie, makin' a bonny target, an' ye think ye are the one who asks the questions. So ye know how to fight, do ye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"So you'll fight monsters tae save the big wee hag? Will ye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The big wee hag?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's Tiffany tae ye."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You mean Tiffany Aching? What's happened to her?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You'll be ready for when she needs ye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes! Of course! Who are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And ye know how tae fight?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've read the Manual of Swordsmanship all the way through!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a few seconds the voice from the high shadows said: "Ah, I think I've put ma finger on a wee flaw in this plan…."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">There was an armory across the castle courtyard. It wasn't much of one. There was a suit of armor made of various nonmatching pieces, a few swords, a battle-axe that no one had ever been able to lift, and a chain-mail suit that appeared to have been attacked by extremely strong moths. And there were some wooden dummies on big springs for sword practice. Right now the Feegles were watching Roland attack one with a great deal of enthusiasm.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach weel," said Big Yan despondently as Roland leaped about. "If he never meets anythin' other than bits o'wood that dinna fight back, he might be okay."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's willin'," Rob Anybody pointed out as Roland put his foot against the dummy and tried to tug the sword point out of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye." Big Yan looked glum.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"He's got a bonny action, ye must admit," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland succeeded in pulling the sword out of the dummy, which sprang back on its ancient spring and hit him on the head.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Blinking a little, the boy looked down at the Feegles. He remembered them from the time he was rescued from the Queen of the Elves. No one who met the Nac Mac Feegles ever forgot them, even if they tried hard. But it was all vague. He'd been near crazy part of the time, and unconscious, and had seen so many strange things that it was hard to know what was real and what wasn't.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Now he knew: They were real. Who'd make up a thing like this? Okay, one of them was a cheese that rolled around of its own accord, but nobody was perfect.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What am I going to have to do, Mr. Anybody?" he asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody had been worried about this bit. Words like "Underworld" can give people the wrong idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ye must rescue a…lady," he said. "Not the big wee hag. Another…lady. We can take ye to the place where she bides. It's like…undergroound, ye ken. She's like…sleepin'. An' all ye ha' tae do is bring her up tae the surface, kind o' thing."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, you mean like Orpheo rescuing Euniphon from the Underworld?" said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody just stared.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's a myth from Ephebe," Roland went on. "It's supposed to be a love story, but it's really a metaphor for the annual return of summer. There's a lot of versions of that story."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They still stared. Feegles have very worrying stares. They're even worse than chickens in that respect.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
     
     
      <div class="paragraph">That was then. This is now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, crivens," moaned Wee Dangerous Spike, on the roof of the cart shed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The fire went out. The snow that had filled the sky began to thin. Wee Dangerous Spike heard a scream high overhead and knew exactly what to do. He raised his arms in the air and shut his eyes just as the buzzard swooped out of the white sky and snatched him up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He liked this bit. When he opened his eyes, the world was swinging beneath him and a voice nearby said, "Get up here quick, laddie!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He grabbed the thin leather harness above him and pulled, and the talons gently released their grip. Then, hand over hand in the wind of the flight, he dragged himself across the bird's feathers until he could grab the belt of Hamish the aviator.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Rob says ye're old enough tae come doon intae the Underworld," said Hamish over his shoulder. "Rob's gone tae fetch the Hero. Ye are a lucky wee laddie!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The bird banked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Below, the snow…fled. There was no more melting, it simply drew back from the lambing pen like the tide going out or a deep breath being taken, with no more sound than a sigh.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Morag skimmed over the lambing field, where men were looking around in puzzlement. "One deid ship and a dozen deid lambs," said Hamish, "but no big wee hag! He's taken her."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Where to?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Hamish steered Morag up in a big wide circle. Around the farm the snow had stopped falling. But up on the downs it was still dropping like hammers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then it took a shape.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Up there," he said.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">All right, I'm alive. I'm pretty sure about that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Yes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I can feel the cold all around me, but I don't feel cold, which would be pretty hard to explain to anyone else.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And I can't move. Not at all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">White all around me. And inside my head, all white.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who am I?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I can remember the name Tiffany. I hope that was me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">White all around me. That happened before. It was a kind of dream or memory or something else I don't have a word for. And all around me, whiteness falling. And building up around me, and lifting me up. It was…the chalk lands being built, silently, under ancient seas.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">That's what my name means.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It means Land Under Wave.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And, like a wave, color came flooding back into her mind. It was mostly the redness of rage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">How dare he!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">To kill the lambs!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Aching wouldn't have allowed that. She never lost a lamb. She could bring them back to life.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I should never have left here in the first place, Tiffany thought. Perhaps I should have stayed and tried to learn things by myself. But if I hadn't gone, would I still be me? Know what I know? Would I have been as strong as my grandmother, or would I just be a cackler? Well, I'll be strong now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the killing weather was blind nature, you could only cuss; but if it was walking about on two legs…then it was war. And there would be a reckoning!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She tried to move, and now the whiteness gave way. It felt like hard snow, but it wasn't cold to her touch; it fell away, leaving a hole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A smooth, slightly transparent floor stretched away in front of her. There were big pillars rising up to a ceiling that was hidden by some sort of fog.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were walls made of the same stuff as the floor. They looked like ice—she could even see little bubbles inside them—but were no more than cool when she touched them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was a very large room. There was no furniture of any sort. It was just the sort of room a king would build to say "Look, I can afford to waste all this space!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her footsteps echoed as she explored. No, not even a chair. And how comfortable would it be if she found one?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She did, eventually, find a staircase that went up (unless, of course, you started at the top). It led to another hall that at least had furniture. They were the sort of couches that rich ladies were supposed to lounge on, looking tired but beautiful. Oh, and there were urns, quite big urns, and statues, too, all in the same warm ice. The statues showed athletes and gods, very much like the pictures in Chaffinch's Mythology, doing ancient things like hurling javelins or killing huge snakes with their bare hands. They didn't have a stitch of clothing between them, but all the men wore fig leaves, which Tiffany, in a spirit of enquiry, found would not come off.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And there was a fire. The first strange thing about it was that the logs were also of the same ice. The other strange thing was that the flames were blue—and cold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">This level had tall pointed windows, but they began a long way from the floor and showed nothing but the sky, where the pale sun was a ghost among the clouds.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another staircase, very grand this time, led up to yet another floor with more statues and couches and urns. Who could live in a place like this? Someone who didn't need to eat or sleep, that's who. Someone who didn't need to be comfortable.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wintersmith!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Her voice bounced from wall to wall, sending back "ITH…Ith…ith…" until it died away.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Another staircase, then, and this time there was something new. On a plinth, where there might have been a statue, was a crown. It floated in the air a few feet above the base, turning gently, and glittered with frost. A little bit farther on was another statue, smaller than most, but around this one, blue and green and gold lights danced and shimmered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They looked just like the Hublights that could sometimes be seen in the depths of winter floating over the mountains at the center of the world. Some people thought they were alive.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The statue was the same height as Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wintersmith!" There was still no reply. A nice palace with no kitchen, no bed…. He didn't need to eat or sleep, so who was it for?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She knew the answer already: me.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She reached out to touch the dancing lights, and they swarmed up her arm and spread across her body, making a dress that glittered like moonlight on snowfields. She was shocked, then angry. Then she wished she had a mirror, felt guilty about that, and went back to being angry again, and resolved that if by chance she did find a mirror, the only reason she'd look in it would be to check how angry she was.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After searching for a while, she found a mirror, which was nothing more than a wall of ice of such a dark green that it was almost black.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She did look angry. And immensely, beautifully sparkly. There were little glints of gold on the blue and green, just like there were in the sky on wintry nights.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Wintersmith!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He must be watching her. He could be anywhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right! I'm here! You know that!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes. I do," said the Wintersmith behind her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany spun around and slapped him across the face, then slapped him again with her other hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was like hitting rock. He was learning very quickly now.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's for the lambs," she said, trying to shake some life back into her fingers. "How dare you! You didn't have to!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He looked much more human. Either he was wearing real clothes or he had worked hard on making them look real. He'd actually managed to look…well, handsome. Not cold anymore, just…cool.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He's nothing but a snowman, her Second Thoughts protested. Remember that. He's just too smart to have coal for eyes or a carrot for a nose.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ouch," said the Wintersmith, as if he'd just remembered to say it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I demand that you let me go!" Tiffany snapped. "Right now!" That's right, her Second Thoughts said. You want him to end up cowering behind the saucepans on top of the kitchen dresser. As it were…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"At this moment," said the Wintersmith very calmly, "I am a gale wrecking ships a thousand miles away. I am freezing water pipes in a snowbound town. I am freezing the sweat on a dying man, lost in a terrible blizzard. I creep silently under doors. I hang from gutters. I stroke the fur of the sleeping bear, deep in her cave, and course in the blood of the fishes under the ice."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't care!" said Tiffany. "I don't want to be here! And you shouldn't be here either!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Child, will you walk with me?" said the Wintersmith. "I will not harm you. You are safe here."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What from?" said Tiffany, and then, because too much time around Miss Tick does something to your conversation, even in times of stress, she changed this to: "From what?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Death," said the Wintersmith. "Here you will never die."</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">At the back of the Feegles' chalk pit, more chalk had been carved out of the wall to make a tunnel about five feet high and perhaps as long.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In front of it stood Roland de Chumsfanleigh (it wasn't his fault). His ancestors had been knights, and they had come to own the Chalk by killing the kings who thought they did. Swords, that's what it had all been about. Swords and cutting off heads. That was how you got land in the old days, and then the rules were changed so that you didn't need a sword to own land anymore, you just needed the right piece of paper. But his ancestors had still hung on to their swords, just in case people thought that the whole thing with the bits of paper was unfair, it being a fact that you can't please everybody.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He'd always wanted to be good with a sword, and it had come as a shock to find they were so heavy. He was great at air sword. In front of a mirror he could fence against his reflection and win nearly all the time. Real swords didn't allow that. You tried to swing them and they ended up swinging you. He'd realized that maybe he was more cut out for bits of paper. Besides, he needed glasses, which could be a bit tricky under a helmet, especially if someone was hitting you with a sword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He wore a helmet now, and held a sword that was—although he wouldn't admit it—far too heavy for him. He was also wearing a suit of chain mail that made it very hard to walk. The Feegles had done their best to make it fit, but the crotch hung down to his knees and flapped amusingly when he moved.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'm not a hero, he thought. I've got a sword, which I need two hands to lift, and I've got a shield that is also really heavy, and I've got a horse with curtains around it that I've had to leave at home (and my aunts will go mad when they go into the drawing room), but inside I'm a kid who would quite like to know where the privy is….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But she rescued me from the Queen of the Elves. If she hadn't, I'd still be a stupid kid instead of…um…a young man hoping he isn't too stupid.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Nac Mac Feegles had exploded back into his room, fighting their way through the storm that had arrived overnight, and now, they said, it was time for him to be a Hero for Tiffany…. Well, he would be. He was sure of that. Fairly sure. But right now the scenery wasn't what he'd expected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You know, this doesn't look like the entrance to the Underworld," he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, any cave can be the way in," said Rob Anybody, who was sitting on Roland's helmet. "But ye must ha' the knowin' o' the crawstep. Okay, Big Yan, ye go first…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Big Yan strutted up to the chalk hole. He stuck out his arms behind him, bent at the elbows. He leaned backward, sticking out one leg to keep his balance. Then he wiggled the foot in the air a few times, leaned forward, and vanished as soon as the foot touched the ground.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody banged on Roland's helmet with his fist.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Okay, big Hero," he shouted. "Off ye go!"</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>

      <div class="paragraph">There was no way out. Tiffany didn't even know if there was a way in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"If you were the Summer Lady, then we would dance," said the Wintersmith. "But I know now that you are not her, even though you seem to be. But for the sake of you I am now human, and I must have company."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany's racing mind showed her pictures: the sprouting acorn, the fertile feet, the Cornucopia. I'm just enough of a goddess to fool a few floorboards and an acorn and a handful of seeds, she thought. I'm just like him. Iron enough to make a nail doesn't make a snowman human, and a couple of oak leaves don't make me a goddess.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Come," said the Wintersmith, "let me show you my world. Our world."</div>

      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">When Roland opened his eyes, all he could see were shadows. Not shadows of things—just shadows, drifting like cobwebs.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I was expecting somewhere…hotter," he said, trying to keep the relief out of his voice. Around him, Feegles popped out of nowhere.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, you're thinkin' o' hells," said Rob Anybody. "They tends to be on the toasty side, it's true. Underworlds are more o' the gloomy sort. It's where folks end up when they's lost, ye ken."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What? You mean if it's a dark night and you take the wrong turning—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, no! Like mebbe deid when they shouldn't be an' there's nae place for 'em tae go, or they fall doon a gap in the worlds an' dinna ken the way. Some o' them don't even ken where they are, poor souls. There's an awful lot o' that kind o' thing. There's no' a lot o' laughs in a underworld. This one used tae be called Limbo, ye ken, 'cuz the door was verra low. Looks like it's gone way downhill since we wuz last here." He raised his voice. "An' a big hand, lads, for young Wee Dangerous Spike, oot wi' us for the first time!" There was a ragged cheer, and Wee Dangerous Spike waved his sword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland pushed his way through the shadows, which actually offered some resistance. The very air was gray down here. Sometimes he heard groans, or someone coughing in the distance…and then there were footsteps, shuffling toward him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He drew his sword and peered through the gloom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Shadows parted and a very old woman in tattered, threadbare clothes shuffled past, dragging a large cardboard box behind her. It bounced awkwardly as she tugged at it. She didn't even glance at Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He lowered the sword.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I thought there'd be monsters," he said as the old woman disappeared into the gloom.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye," said Rob Anybody grimly. "There are. Think o' somethin' solid, will ye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Something solid?!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm nae jokin'! Think o' a nice big mountain, or a hammer! Whatever ye do, dinna wish or regret or hope!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland closed his eyes and then reached up to touch them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can still see! But my eyes are shut!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye! And ye'll see more wi' yer een shut. Look aroond ye, if ye dare!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland, his eyes shut, took a few steps forward and looked around. Nothing seemed to have changed. Perhaps things were slightly more gloomy. And then he saw it—a flash of bright orange, a line in the dark that came and went.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What was that?" he asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We dinna ken whut they call themselves. We call 'em bogles," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They are flashes of light?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, that one was a long way away," said Rob. "If ye want tae see one close up, it's standin' right beside ye…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland spun around.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, ye see, ye made a classic mistake right there," said Rob, conversationally. "Ye opened yer eyes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland shut his eyes. The bogle was standing six inches away from him.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He didn't flinch. He didn't scream. Hundreds of Feegles were watching him, he knew.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">At first he thought: It's a skeleton. When it flashed again, it looked like a bird, a tall bird like a heron. Then it was a stick figure, like a kid would draw. Over and over again it scribbled itself against the darkness in thin, burning lines.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It scribbled itself a mouth and leaned forward for a moment, showing hundreds of needle teeth. Then it vanished.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a murmur from the Feegles.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, ye done weel," said Rob Anybody. "Ye stared it in the mouth and ye didna take so much as a step back."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mr. Anybody, I was too scared to run," Roland muttered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody leaned down until he was level with the boy's ear.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye," he whispered, "I ken that well enough! There be a lot o' men who became heroes 'cuz they wuz too scared tae run! But ye didna yell nor cack yer kecks, an' that's good. There'll be more o' them as we go on. Dinna let them intae yer heid! Keep 'em oot!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why, what do they—? No, don't tell me!" said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He walked on through the shadows, blinking so he wouldn't miss anything. The old woman had gone, but the gloom began to fill up with people. Mostly they stood by themselves, or sat on chairs. Some wandered around quietly. They passed a man in ancient clothing who was staring at his own hand as though he were seeing it for the first time.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a woman swaying gently and singing a nonsense song in a quiet, little-girl voice. She gave Roland a strange, mad smile as he walked past. Right behind her stood a bogle.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"All right," said Roland grimly. "Now tell me what they do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"They eat yer memories," said Rob Anybody. "Yer thoughts is real tae them. Wishes an' hope are like food! They're vermin, really. This is whut happens when these places are no' looked after."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And how can I kill them?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, that was a verra nasty voice ye just used. Hark at the big wee hero! Dinna bother aboot them, laddie. They won't attack ye yet, and we've got a job tae do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hate this place!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, hells is a lot more lively," said Rob Anybody. "Slow doon now—we're at the river."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A river ran through the Underworld. It was as dark as the soil, and lapped at its banks in a slow, oily way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, I think I've heard of this," said Roland. "There's a ferryman, right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">YES.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He was there, suddenly, standing in a long, low boat. He was all in black, of course in black, with a deep hood that entirely concealed his face and gave a definite feeling that this was just as well.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Hi, pal," said Rob Anybody cheerfully. "How're ye doin'?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">OH NO, NOT YOU PEOPLE AGAIN, said the dark figure in a voice that was not so much heard as felt. I THOUGHT YOU WERE BANNED.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Just a wee misunderstandin', ye ken," said Rob, sliding down Roland's armor. "Ye have tae let us in, 'cuz we's deid already."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The figure extended an arm. The black robe fell away, and what pointed at Roland looked, to him, very much like a bony finger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">BUT 
       HE
        
       
       MUST PAY THE FERRYMAN, he said accusingly, in a voice of crypts and graveyards.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not until I'm on the other side," Roland said firmly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, c'mon!" said Daft Wullie to the ferryman. "Ye can see he's a Hero! If ye canna trust a Hero, who can ye trust?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The cowl regarded Roland for what seemed like a hundred years.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">OH, VERY WELL THEN.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Feegles swarmed aboard the rotting boat with their usual enthusiasm and cries of "Crivens!" "Where's the booze on this cruise?" and "We're right oot in the Styx noo!" and Roland climbed in with care, watching the ferryman suspiciously.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The figure pulled on the big oar, and they set off with a creak and then, regrettably, and to the ferryman's disgust, to the sound of singing. More or less singing, that is, at every possible speed and tempo and with no regard at all for the tune:</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Row row yer row boat boat boaty boat down boat stream boat merrily stream like a bird on the boa—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">WILL YOU SHUT UP?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"—bonny boat row stream stream boat boat row yer boat down the merrily stream row merrily merrily boat—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">THIS IS HARDLY APPROPRIATE!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Down the boat boat down the merrily stream stream stream merrily merrily merrily merrily merrily merrily boat!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mr. Anybody?" said Roland as they glided jerkily along.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Why am I sitting next to a blue cheese with a bit of tartan wrapped around it?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, that'd be Horace," said Rob Anybody. "He's Daft Wullie's pal. He's no' bein' a nuisance, is he?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. But he's trying to sing!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, all blue cheeses hum a bit."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mnamnam mnam mnamnam," sang Horace.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The boat bumped against the far bank, and the ferryman stepped ashore quickly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody scrambled up Roland's ragged chain-mail sleeve and whispered: "When I gi'e ye the word, run for it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But I can pay the ferryman. I have the money," said Roland, patting his pocket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You whut?" said the Feegle, as if this were some strange and dangerous idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have the money," Roland repeated. "Two pennies is the rate to cross the River of the Dead. It's an old tradition. Two pennies to put on the eyes of the dead, to pay the ferryman."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Whut a clever man ye are, to be sure," said Rob as Roland dropped two copper coins into the ferryman's bony hand. "An' did ye no' think tae bring four pennies?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The book just said the dead take two," said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, mebbe they do," Rob agreed, "but that's 'cuz the deid dinna expect tae be comin' back!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland looked back across the dark river. Flashes of orange light were thick on the bank they'd left.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mr. Anybody, I was once a prisoner of the Queen of Fairyland."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, I ken that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It was for a year in this world, but it only seemed like a few days there…except that the weeks passed like centuries. It was so…dull, I could hardly remember anything after a while. Not my name, not the feel of sunshine, not the taste of real food."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, we ken that—we helped tae rescue ye. Ye niver say thanks, but ye wuz oot o' yer skull the whole time, so we didna take offense."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then allow me to thank you now, Mr. Anybody."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Dinna mention it. Anytime. Happy tae oblige."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She had pets that fed you dreams until you died of hunger. I hate things that try to take away what you are. I want to kill those things, Mr. Anybody. I want to kill all of them. When you take away memories, you take away the person. Everything they are."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"'Tis a fine ambition ye've got there," said Rob. "But we ha' got a wee job tae do, ye ken. Aw crivens, this is whut happens when things get sloppy an' bogles take over."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a big pile of bones on the path. They were certainly animal bones, and the rotting collars and lengths of rusted chain were another clue.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Three big dogs?" said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"One verra big dog wi' three heads," said Rob Anybody. "Verra popular in underworlds, that breed. Can bite right through a man's throat. Three times!" he added with relish. "But put three doggy biscuits in a row on the groond, an' the puir wee thing sits there strainin' an' whinin' all day. It's a wee laff, I'm tellin' ye!" He kicked at the bones. "Aye, time wuz when places like this had some pers'nality. Look, see what they've done here, too."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Farther along the path was what was probably a demon. It had a horrible face, with so many fangs that some of them must have been just for show. There were wings, too, but they couldn't possibly have lifted it. It had found a piece of mirror, and every few seconds it took a peep into it and shuddered.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mr. Anybody," said Roland, "is there anything down here that this sword I'm carrying could kill?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, no. No' kill," said Rob Anybody. "No' bogles. No' as such. It's no' a magic sword, see?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then why am I dragging it along?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"'Cuz ye are a Hero. Who ever heard o'a Hero wi'oot a sword?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland tugged the sword out of its scabbard. It was heavy and not at all like the flying, darting silver thing that he'd imagined in front of the mirror. It was more like a metal club with an edge.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He gripped it in both hands and managed to hurl it out into the middle of the slow, dark river.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Just before it hit the water, a white arm rose and caught it. The hand waved the sword a couple of times and then disappeared with it under the water.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Was that supposed to happen?" he asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A man throwin' his sword awa'?" yelled Rob. "No! Ye're no' supposed tae bung a guid sword intae the drinkie!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, I mean the hand," said Roland. "It just—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, they turn up sometimes." Rob Anybody waved a hand as if midstream underwater sword jugglers were an everyday occurrence. "But ye've got no weapon noo!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You said swords can't hurt bogles!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, but it's the look o' the thing, okay?" said Rob, hurrying on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But not having a sword should make me more heroic, right?" said Roland, as the rest of the Feegles trotted after them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Technic'ly, aye," said Rob Anybody reluctantly. "But mebbe also more deid."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Besides, I have a Plan," said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ye have a Plan?" said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes. I mean aye."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Writted doon?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've only just thought of—" Roland stopped. The ever-shifting shadows had parted, and a big cave lay ahead.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the center of it, surrounding what looked like a rock slab, was a dim yellow glow. There was a small figure lying on the slab.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Here we are," said Rob Anybody. "That wasna so bad, aye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland blinked. Hundreds of bogles were clustered around the slab, but at a distance, as if they were not keen on going any closer.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I can see…someone lying down," he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's Summer herself," said Rob. "We have tae be canny aboot this."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Canny?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Like…careful," said Rob helpfully. "Goddesses can be a wee bit tricky. Verra image conscious."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Don't we just…you know, grab her and run?" said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, aye, we'll end up doin' somethin' like that," said Rob. "But you, mister, will have tae be the one tae kiss her first. You okay wi' that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland looked a bit strained, but he said: "Yes…er, fine."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The ladies expect it, ye ken," Rob went on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And then we run for it?" said Roland hopefully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye, 'cuz probably that's when the bogles will try an' stop us gettin' awa.' It's people leavin' that they don't like. Off ye go, laddie."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I've got a Plan, thought Roland, walking toward the slab. And I'll concentrate on it so that I don't think about the fact that I'm walking through a crowd of scribbly monsters that are only there if I blink and my eyes are watering. What's in my head is real to them, right?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'm going to blink, I'm going to blink, I'm going to…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…blink. It was over in a moment, but the shudder went on for a lot longer. They had been everywhere, and every toothy mouth was looking at him. It should not be possible to look with teeth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He ran forward, eyes streaming with the effort of not closing, and looked down at the figure lying in the yellow glow. It was female, it was breathing, it was asleep, and it looked like Tiffany Aching.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">From the top of the ice palace Tiffany could see for miles, and they were miles of snow. Only on the Chalk was there any sign of green. It was an island.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You see how I learn?" said the Wintersmith. "The Chalk is yours. So there summer will come, and you will be happy. And you will be my bride and I will be happy. And everything will be happy. Happiness is when things are correct. Now I am human, I understand these things."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Don't scream, don't shout, said her Third Thoughts. Don't freeze up, either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh…I see," she said. "And the rest of the world will stay in winter?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No, there are some latitudes that never feel my frost," said the Wintersmith. "But the mountains, the plains as far as the circle sea…oh, yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Millions of people will die!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But only once, you see. That is what makes it wonderful. And after that, no more death!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And Tiffany saw it, like a Hogswatch card: birds frozen to their twigs, horses and cows standing still in the fields, frozen grass like daggers, no smoke from any chimney; a world without death because there was nothing left to die, and everything glittering like tinsel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She nodded carefully. "Very…sensible," she said. "But it would be a shame if nothing moved at all."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That would be easy. Snow people," said the Wintersmith. "I can make them human!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Iron enough to make a nail?" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes! It is easy. I have eaten sausage! And I can think! I never thought before. I was a part. Now I am apart. Only when you are apart do you know who you are."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You made me roses of ice," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes! Already I was becoming!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the roses melted at dawn, Tiffany added to herself, and glanced at the pale-yellow sun. It had just enough strength to make the Wintersmith sparkle. He does think like a human, she thought, looking into the odd smile. He thinks like a human who's never met another human. He's cackling. He's so mad, he will never understand how mad he is.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He just doesn't have a clue what "human" means, he doesn't know what horrors he's planning, he just doesn't…understand. And he's so happy he's almost sweet….</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody banged on Roland's helmet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Get on wi' it, laddie," he demanded.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland stared at the glowing figure. "This can't be Tiffany!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, she's a goddess, she can look like anythin'," said Rob Anybody. "Just a wee peck on the cheek, okay? Dinna get enthusiastic, we havena got all day. A wee peck an' we're offski."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something butted Roland on the ankle. It was a blue cheese.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Dinna fash yerself aboot Horace—he just wants ye tae do the right thing," said the mad Feegle whom Roland had come to know as Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He went closer, with the glow crackling around him, because no man wants to be a coward in front of a cheese.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This is kind of…embarrassing," he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens, get on wi' it, will ye?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland leaned forward and pecked the sleeping cheek.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The sleeper opened her eyes, and he took a step back very quickly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"That's not Tiffany Aching!" he said, and blinked. Bogles were as thick around him as grass stems.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Now take her by the hand an' run," said Rob Anybody. "The bogles will turn nasty when they see we're leavin'." He banged cheerfully on the side of the helmet and added: "But that's okay, right? 'Cuz ye have a Plan!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hope I've got it right, though," said Roland. "My aunts say I'm too clever by half."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Glad tae hear it," said Rob Anybody, "'cuz that's much better than bein' too stupid by three quarters! Now grab the lady an' run!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland tried to avoid the stare of the girl as he took her hand and pulled her gently off the slab. She said something in a language he couldn't understand, except that it sounded as though there were a question mark on the end of it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm here to rescue you," he said. She looked at him with the golden eyes of a snake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The sheep girl is in trouble," she said, in a voice full of unpleasant echoes and hisses. "So sad, so sad."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, er, we'd better run," he managed, "whoever you are…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The not-Tiffany gave him a smile. It was an uncomfortable one, with a bit of a smirk in it. They ran.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How do you fight the bogles?" he panted when the Feegle army jogged through the caves.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, they dinna like the taste o' us overmuch," said Rob Anybody as the shadows parted. "It may be 'cuz we think aboot the drinkin' a lot—it makes 'em squiffy. Keep movin'!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And it was at this point that the bogles struck, although that was hardly the right word. It was more like running into a wall of whispers. Nothing grabbed; there were no claws. If thousands of tiny weak things like shrimps or flies were trying to stop someone, this would be how it felt.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But the ferryman was waiting. He raised a hand as Roland staggered toward the boat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">THAT WILL BE SIX PENNIES, he said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Six?" said Roland.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah, we wasna doon here more'n two hour, an' bang went sixpence!" said Daft Wullie.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">ONE ONE-DAY ROUND TRIP, ONE ONE-WAY, said the ferryman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I don't have that much!" Roland shouted. He was beginning to feel little tugs in his head now. Thoughts had to push hard to get as far as his mouth.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Leave this tae me," said Rob Anybody. He turned to look down on his fellow Feegles and banged on Roland's helmet for silence.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Okay, lads," he announced. "We're no' leavin'!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">WHAT? said the ferryman. OH NO, YOU 
       LEAVE! I'M NOT HAVING YOU DOWN HERE AGAIN! WE'RE STILL FINDING THE BOTTLES FROM LAST TIME! COME ON, GET ON THE BOAT THIS MINUTE!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Crivens, we canna do that, pal," said Rob Anybody. "We're under a geas to help this lad, ye ken. Where he disna go, we dinna go!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT TO STAY HERE! snapped the ferryman.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ach, we'll soon ha' the old place jumpin' again," said Rob Anybody, grinning.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The ferryman drummed his fingers on the pole. They made a clicking sound, like dice.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">OH, ALL RIGHT THEN. BUT—AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THIS—THERE IS TO BE NO SINGING!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland dragged the girl onto the boat. The bogles kept clear of that, at least, but as the ferryman pushed away from the shore, Big Yan kicked Roland on the boot and pointed upward. Scribbles of orange light, hundreds of them, were moving across the roof of the cavern. There were more of them on the opposite shore.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How's the Plan goin', Mister Hero?" asked Rob Anybody quietly as he climbed down from the boy's helmet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm waiting for the opportune moment," said Roland haughtily. He turned to look at the not-Tiffany. "I'm here to get you out," he said, trying not to look directly at her eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You?" said the not-Tiffany, as if the idea were amusing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, us," Roland corrected himself. "Everything is—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a bump as the boat grounded on the farther shore, where the bogles were as thick as standing corn.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Off ye go, then," said Big Yan.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland pulled the not-Tiffany along the path for a few steps, and stopped. When he blinked, the path ahead was a writhing orange mass. He could feel the little pulls on him, no stronger than a breeze. But they were in his brain, too. Cold, and nibbling. This was stupid. It couldn't work. He wouldn't be able to do it. He wasn't any good at this sort of thing. He was wayward and inconsiderate and disobedient, just like his…aunts…said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Behind him, Daft Wullie shouted, in his cheerful way, "Make yer aunties proud of ye!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland half turned, suddenly angry. "My aunts? Let me tell you about my aunts—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No time, laddie!" shouted Rob Anybody. "Get on wi' it!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland looked around, his mind on fire.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Our memories are real, he thought. And I will not stand for this!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He turned to the not-Tiffany and said: "Don't be afraid." Then he held out his left hand and whispered, under his breath: "I remember…a sword…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When he shut his eyes, there it was—so light he could barely feel it, so thin he could hardly see it, a line in the air that was made up mostly of sharpness. He'd killed a thousand enemies with it, in the mirror. It was never too heavy, it moved like part of him, and here it was. A weapon that chopped away everything that clung and lied and stole.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Mebbe ye can make a Hero all in one go," said Rob Anybody thoughtfully, as bogles scribbled themselves into existence and died. He turned to Daft Wullie. "Daft Wullie?" he said. "Can ye bring to mind when it was I told ye that sometimes ye say exactly the right thing?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Daft Wullie looked baffled. "Noo that ye mention it, Rob, I dinna recall ye ever sayin' that, ever."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye?" said Rob. "Weel, if I had done, just now would ha' been one o' those times."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Daft Wullie looked worried. "That's all right though, aye? I said somethin' right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye. Ye did, Daft Wullie. A First. I'm proud o' ye," said Rob.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Daft Wullie's face split in an enormous grin. "Crivens! Hey, lads, I said—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But dinna get carried awa'," Rob added.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">As Roland swung the airy blade, the bogles parted like spiderwebs. There were more, always more, but the silver line always found them, cutting him free. They backed away, tried new shapes, recoiled from the heat of the anger in his head. The sword hummed. Bogles curled around the blade and squealed, and sizzled into nothingness on the floor—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">—and someone was banging on his helmet. They'd been doing so for quite a while.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Huh?" he said, opening his eyes.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ye've run oot," said Rob Anybody. His chest heaving, Roland looked around. Eyes open or shut, the caves were empty of orange streaks. The not-Tiffany was watching him with a strange smile on her face.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Either we get oot noo," said Rob, "or ye can hang aroond and wait for some more, mebbe?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' here they come," said Billy Bigchin. He pointed across the river. A pure mass of orange was pouring into the cave, so many bogles that there was no space between them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland hesitated, still fighting for breath.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'll tell ye whut," said Rob Anybody soothingly. "If ye are a guid boy an' rescue the lady, we'll bring ye doon here another time, wi' some sandwiches so's we can make a day o' it."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Roland blinked. "Er, yes," he said. "Um…sorry. I don't know what happened just then…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Offski time!" yelled Big Yan. Roland grabbed the hand of the not-Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' don't look back until we're well oot o' here," said Rob Anybody. "It's kind of traditional."</div>

      <div class="paragraph">On the top of the tower, the ice crown appeared in the Wintersmith's pale hands. It shone more than diamonds could, even in the pale sunlight. It was purest ice, without bubbles, lines, or flaw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I made this for you," he said. "The Summer Lady will never wear it," he added sadly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It fit perfectly. It didn't feel cold.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He stepped back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And now it is done," said the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There is something I have to do, too," said Tiffany. "But first there's something I have to know. You found the things that make a man?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How did you find out what they were?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Wintersmith proudly told her about the children, while Tiffany breathed carefully, forcing herself to relax. His logic was very…logical. After all, if a carrot and two pieces of coal can make a heap of snow a snowman, then a big bucket of salts and gases and metal should certainly make him a human. It made…sense. At least, sense to the Wintersmith.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But, you see, you need to know the whole song," said Tiffany. "It is mostly only about what humans are made of. It isn't about what humans are."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"There were some things that I could not find," said the Wintersmith. "They made no sense. They had no substance."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes," said Tiffany, nodding sadly. "The last three lines, I expect, which are the whole point. I'm really sorry about that."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But I will find them," said the Wintersmith. "I will!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hope you do, one day," said Tiffany. "Now, have you ever heard of Boffo?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What is this Boffo? It was not in the song!" said the Wintersmith, looking uneasy.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, Boffo is how humans change the world by fooling themselves," said Tiffany. "It's wonderful. And Boffo says that things have no power that humans don't put there. You can make things magical, but you can't magically make a human out of things. It's just a nail in your heart. Only a nail."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And the time has come and I know what to do, she thought dreamily. I know how the Story has to end. I must end it in the right kind of way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She pulled the Wintersmith toward her and saw the look of astonishment on his face. She felt light-headed, as though her feet weren't touching the floor. The world became…simpler. It was a tunnel, leading to the future. There was nothing to see but the Wintersmith's cold face, nothing to hear but her own breathing, nothing to feel but the warmth of the sun on her hair.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't the fiery globe of summer, but it was still much bigger than any bonfire could ever be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Where this takes me, there I choose to go, she told herself, letting the warmth pour into her. I choose. This I choose to do. And I'm going to have to stand on tiptoe, she added.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Thunder on my right hand. Lightning in my left hand.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Fire above me….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Please," she said, "take the winter away. Go back to your mountains. Please."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Frost in front of me….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No. I am Winter. I cannot be anything else."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then you cannot be human," said Tiffany. "The last three lines are: ‘Strength enough to build a home, Time enough to hold a child, Love enough to break a heart.'"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Balance…and it came quickly, out of nowhere, lifting her up inside.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The center of the seesaw does not move. It feels neither upness nor downness. It is balanced.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Balance…and his lips were like blue ice. She'd cry, later, for the Wintersmith who wanted to be human.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Balance…and the old kelda had once told her: "There's a little bitty bit inside ye that willna melt and flow."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Time to thaw.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She shut her eyes and kissed the Wintersmith…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…and drew down the sun.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Frost to fire.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">The entire top of the ice palace melted in a flash of white light that cast shadows on walls a hundred miles away. A pillar of steam roared up, stitched with lightning, and spread out above the world like an umbrella, covering the sun. Then it began to fall back as a soft, warm rain that punched little wormholes in the snow.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany, her head usually so full of thoughts, hadn't got a thought to spare. She lay on a slab of ice in the soft rain and listened to the palace collapse around her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There are times when everything that you can do has been done and there's nothing for it now but to curl up and wait for the thunder to die down.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was something else in the air, too, a golden glint that vanished when she tried to look at it and then turned up again in the corner of her eye.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The palace was melting like a waterfall. The slab she lay on half slid and half floated down a staircase that was turning into a river. Above her, huge pillars fell but went from ice to a gush of warm water in midair, so that what crashed down was spray.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Good-bye to the glittering crown, Tiffany thought with a touch of regret. Good-bye to the dress made of dancing light, and good-bye to the ice roses and the snowflakes. Such a shame. Such a shame.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then there was grass under her, and so much water pouring past her that it was a case of get up or drown. She managed to get to her knees, at least, and waited until it was possible to stand up without being knocked over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You have something of mine, child," said a voice behind her. She turned, and golden light rushed into a shape. It was her own shape, but her eyes were… odd, like a snake's. Right here and now, with the roaring of the heat of the sun still filling her ears, this didn't seem very amazing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Slowly, Tiffany took the Cornucopia out of her pocket and handed it over.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You are the Summer Lady, aren't you?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And you are the sheep-girl who would be me?" There was a hiss to the words.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I didn't want to be!" said Tiffany hurriedly. "Why do you look like me?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Summer Lady sat down on the turf. It is very strange to watch yourself, and Tiffany noticed she had a small mole on the back of her neck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's called resonance," she said. "Do you know what that is?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It means ‘vibrating with,'" said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"How does a sheep-girl know that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I have a dictionary," said Tiffany. "And I'm a witch, thank you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, while you were picking up things from me, I've been picking up things from you, clever sheep-witch," said the Summer Lady. She was beginning to remind Tiffany a lot of Annagramma. That was actually a relief. She didn't sound wise, or nice…she was just another person, who happened to be very powerful but not frighteningly smart and was, frankly, a bit annoying.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What's your real shape?" Tiffany asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The shape of heat on a road, the shape of the smell of apples." Nice reply, Tiffany thought, but not helpful, as such.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany sat down next to the goddess. "Am I in trouble?" she asked.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Because of what you did to the Wintersmith? No. He has to die every year, as do I. We die, and sleep and wake. Besides…you were entertaining."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh? I was entertaining, was I?" said Tiffany, her eyes narrowing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What is it you want?" asked the Summer Lady. Yes, thought Tiffany, just like Annagramma. Wouldn't spot a hint a mile high.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Want?" said Tiffany. "Nothing. Just the summer, thank you."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Summer Lady looked puzzled. "But humans always want something from gods."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But witches don't accept payment. Green grass and blue skies will do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What? You'll get those anyway!" The Summer Lady sounded both confused and angry, and Tiffany was quite happy about this, in a small and spiteful way.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Good," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You saved the world from the Wintersmith!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Actually, I saved it from a silly girl, Miss Summer. I put right what I put wrong."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"One simple mistake? You'd be a silly girl not to accept a reward."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'd be a sensible young woman to refuse one," said Tiffany, and it felt good to say that. "Winter is over. I know. I've seen it through. Where it took me, there I chose to go. I chose when I danced with the Wintersmith."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Summer Lady stood up. "Remarkable," she said. "And strange. And now we part. But first, some more things must be taken. Stand up, young woman."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany did so, and when she looked into the face of Summer, golden eyes became pits that drew her in.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And then the summer filled her up. It must have been for only a few seconds, but inside them it went on for much longer. She felt what it was like to be the breeze through green corn on a spring day, to ripen an apple, to make the salmon leap the rapids—the sensations came all at once and merged into one great big, glistening, golden-yellow feeling of summer…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…that grew hotter. Now the sun turned red in a burning sky. Tiffany drifted through air like warm oil into the searing calm of deep deserts, where even camels die. There was no living thing. Nothing moved except ash.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She drifted down a dried-up riverbed, with pure white animal bones on the banks. There was no mud, not one drop of moisture in this oven of a land. This was a river of stones—agates banded like a cat's eye, garnets lying loose, thunder eggs with their rings of color, stones of brown, orange, creamy white, some with black veins, all polished by the heat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Here is the heart of the summer," hissed the voice of the Summer Lady. "Fear me as much as the Wintersmith. We are not yours, though you give us shapes and names. Fire and ice we are, in balance. Do not come between us again…."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And now, at last, there was movement. From out of gaps between the stones they came like stones brought alive: bronze and red, umber and yellow, black and white, with harlequin patterns and deadly gleaming scales.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The snakes tested the boiling air with their forked tongues and hissed triumphantly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The vision vanished. The world came back.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The water had poured away. The everlasting wind had teased the fogs and steams into long streamers of cloud, but the unconquered sun was finding its way through. And, as always happens, and happens far too soon, the strange and wonderful becomes a memory and a memory becomes a dream. Tomorrow it's gone.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany walked across the grass where the palace had been. There were a few pieces of ice left, but they would be gone in an hour. There were the clouds, but clouds drifted away. The normal world pressed in on her, with its dull little songs. She was walking on a stage after the play was over, and who now could say it had ever happened?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Something sizzled on the grass. Tiffany reached down and picked up a piece of metal. It was still warm with the last of the heat that had twisted it out of shape, but you could see that it had once been a nail.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No, I won't take a gift to make the giver feel better, she thought. Why should I? I'll find my own gifts. I was…"entertaining" to her, that's all.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">But him—he made me roses and icebergs and frost and never understood….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She turned suddenly at the sound of voices. The Feegles came bounding over the slope of the downs, at a speed just fast enough for a human to keep up. And Roland was keeping up, panting a little, his overlarge chain mail making him run like a duck.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">She laughed.</div>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <br class="calibre7"/>
      <div class="paragraph">Two weeks later Tiffany went back to Lancre. Roland took her as far as Twoshirts, and the pointy hat took her the rest of the way. That was a bit of luck. The driver remembered Miss Tick, and since there was a spare space on the roof of the coach, he wasn't prepared to go through all that again. The roads were flooded, the ditches gurgled, the swollen rivers sucked at the bridges.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">First she visited Nanny Ogg, who had to be told everything. That saved some time, because once you've told Nanny Ogg, you've more or less told everyone else. When she heard exactly what Tiffany had done to the Wintersmith, she laughed and laughed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany borrowed Nanny's broomstick and flew slowly across the forests to Miss Treason's cottage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Things were going on. In the clearing, several men were digging the vegetable area, and lots of people were hanging around the door, so she landed back in the woods, shoved the broom into a rabbit hole and her hat under a bush, and walked back on foot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Stuck in a birch tree where the track entered the clearing was…a doll, maybe, made out of lots of twigs bound together. It was new, and a bit worrying. That was probably the idea.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">No one saw her raise the catch on the scullery door or slip inside the cottage. She leaned against the kitchen wall and went quiet.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">From the next room came the unmistakable voice of Annagramma at her most typically Annagrammatical.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"—only a tree, do you understand? Cut it up and share the wood. Agreed? And now shake hands. Go on. I mean it. Properly, or else I'll get angry! Good. That feels better, doesn't it? Let's have no more of this silliness—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After ten minutes of listening to people being scolded, grumbled at, and generally prodded, Tiffany crept out again, cut through the woods, and walked into the clearing via the track. There was a woman hurrying toward her, but she stopped when Tiffany said: "Excuse me, is there a witch near here?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ooooh, yes," said the woman, and gave Tiffany a hard stare. "You're not from around here, are you?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"No," said Tiffany, and thought: I lived here for months, Mrs. Carter, and I saw you most days. But I always wore the hat. People always talk to the hat. Without the hat, I'm in disguise.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, there's Miss Hawkin," said Mrs. Carter, as if reluctant to give away a secret. "Be careful, though." She leaned forward and lowered her voice. "She turns into a terrible monster when she's angry! I've seen her! She's all right with us, of course," she added. "Lots of young witches have been coming to learn things from her!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Gosh, she must be good!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's amazing," Mrs. Carter went on. "She'd only been here five minutes and she seemed to know all about us!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Amazing," said Tiffany. You'd think that somebody wrote it all down. Twice. But that wouldn't be interesting enough, would it? And who would believe that a real witch bought her face from Boffo?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And she's got a cauldron that bubbles green," Mrs. Carter said with great pride. "All down the sides. That's proper witching, that is."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It sounds like it," said Tiffany. No witch she'd met had done anything with a cauldron apart from make stew, but somehow people believed in their hearts that a witch's cauldron should bubble green. And that must be why Mr. Boffo sold Item #61 Bubbling Green Cauldron Kit, $14, extra sachets of Green, $1 each.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Well, it worked. It probably shouldn't, but people were people. She didn't think Annagramma would be particularly interested in a visit right now, especially from someone who'd read all the way through the Boffo catalogue, so she retrieved her broom and headed on to Granny Weatherwax's cottage.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a chicken run out in the back garden now. It had been carefully woven out of pliable hazel, and contented werks were coming from the other side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax was coming out of the back door. She looked at Tiffany as if the girl had just come back from a ten-minute stroll.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I've got business down in the town right now," she said. "It wouldn't worry me if you came, too." That was, from Granny, as good as a brass band and an illuminated scroll of welcome. Tiffany fell in alongside her as she strode off along the track.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I hope I find you well, Mistress Weatherwax?" she said, hurrying to keep up.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I'm still here after another winter, that's all I know," said Granny. "You look well, girl."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Oh, yes."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"We saw the steam from up here," said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany said nothing. That was it? Well, yes. From Granny, that would be it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">After a while Granny said: "Come back to see your young friends, eh?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany took a deep breath. She'd been through this in her head dozens of times: what she would say, what Granny would say, what she would shout, what Granny would shout…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You planned it, didn't you?" she said. "If you'd suggested one of the others, they'd probably have got the cottage, so you suggested me. And you knew, you just knew that I'd help her. And it's all worked out, hasn't it? I bet every witch in the mountains knows what happened by now. I bet Mrs. Earwig is seething. And the best bit is, no one got hurt. Annagramma's picked up where Miss Treason left off, all the villagers are happy, and you've won! Oh, I expect you'll say it was to keep me busy and teach me important things and keep my mind off the Wintersmith, but you still won!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny Weatherwax walked on calmly. Then she said: "I see you got your little trinket back."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was like having a bolt of lightning and then not getting any thunder, or throwing a pebble into a pool and not getting a splash.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What? Oh. The horse. Yes! Look, I—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"What kind of fish?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Er…pike," said Tiffany.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah? Some likes 'em, but they are too muddy for my taste."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And that was it. Against Granny's calm she had nowhere to go. She could nag, she could whine, and it wouldn't make any difference. Tiffany consoled herself with the fact that at least Granny knew that she knew. It wasn't much, but it was all she was going to get.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And the horse ain't the only trinket I see," Granny continued. "Magick, is it?" She always stuck a K on the end of any magic she disapproved of.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany glanced down at the ring on her finger. It had a dull shine. It'd never rust while she wore it, the blacksmith had told her, because of the oils in her skin. He'd even taken the time to cut little snowflakes in it with a tiny chisel.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's just a ring I had made out of a nail," she said.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Iron enough to make a ring," said Granny, and Tiffany stopped dead. Did she really get into people's minds? It had to be something like that.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"And why did you decide you wanted a ring?" said Granny.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">For all sorts of reasons that never quite managed to be clear in Tiffany's head, she knew. All she could think of to say was: "It seemed like a good idea at the time." She waited for the explosion.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Then it probably was," said Granny mildly. She stopped, pointed away from the path—in the direction of the town and Nanny Ogg's house—and said: "I put the fence around it. It's got other things protectin' it, you may be sure of that, but some beasts is just too stupid to scare."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was the oak tree sapling, already five feet high. A fence of poles and woven branches surrounded it.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Growing fast, for oak," said Granny. "I'm keeping an eye on it. But come on, I don't want to miss it." She set off again, covering the ground fast. Bewildered, Tiffany ran after her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Miss what?" she panted.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"The dance, of course!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Isn't it too early for that?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Not up here. They starts up here!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny hurried along little paths and behind gardens and came out into the town square, which was thronged with people. Small stalls had been set up. A lot of people were standing around in the slightly hopeless why-are-we-here? way of crowds who're doing what their hearts want to do but their heads feel embarrassed about, but at least there were hot things on sticks to eat. There were lots of white chickens, too. Very good eggs, Nanny had said, so it would have been a shame to kill them.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Granny walked to the front of the crowd. There was no need to push people out of the way. They just moved sideways, without noticing.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They'd arrived just in time. Children came running along the road to the bridge, only just ahead of the dancers who, as they trudged along, seemed like quite homely and ordinary men—men Tiffany'd seen often, working in forges or driving carts. They all wore white clothes, or at least clothes that had been white once, and like the audience they looked a bit sheepish, their expressions suggesting that this was all just a bit of fun, really, not to be taken seriously. They were even waving to people in the crowd. Tiffany looked around and saw Miss Tick, and Nanny, and even Mrs. Earwig…nearly every witch she knew. Oh, and there was Annagramma, minus Mr. Boffo's little devices, and looking very proud.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't like this last autumn, she thought. It was dark and quiet and solemn and hidden, everything that this isn't. Who watched it from the shadows?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Who is watching now from the light? Who is here in secret?</div>
  <div class="paragraph">A drummer and a man with an accordion pushed their way through the crowd, along with the local pub owner carrying eight pints of beer on a tray (because no grown man is going to dance in front of his friends with ribbons around his hat and bells on his trousers without the clear prospect of a large drink).</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When the noise had died down a bit, the drummer beat the drum a few times and the accordionist played a long-drawn-out chord, the legal signal that a Morris dance is about to begin, and people who hang around after this have only got themselves to blame.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The two-man band struck up. The men, in two lines of three facing each other, counted the beat and then leaped…. Tiffany turned to Granny as twelve hobnailed boots crashed to the ground, throwing up sparks.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Tell me how to take away pain," she said, above the noise of the dance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crash!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It's hard," said Granny, not taking her eyes off the dancers. Crash went the boots again.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You can move it out of the body?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crash!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Sometimes. Or hide it. Or make a cage for it and carry it away. And all of it's dangerous, and it will kill you if you don't respect it, young woman. It is all price and no profit. You are asking me to tell you how to put your hand in the lion's mouth."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crash!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"I must know, to help the Baron. It's bad. There is a lot I have to do."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This you choose to do?" said Granny, still watching.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Yes!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crash!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This is your Baron who doesn't like witches?" said Granny, her gaze going from face to face in the crowd.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"But who does like witches until they need one, Mistress Weatherwax?" said Tiffany sweetly.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Crash!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"This is a reckoning, Mistress Weatherwax," Tiffany added. After all, once you've kissed the Wintersmith, you're in the mood to dare. And Granny Weatherwax smiled, as if she'd done all that was expected of her.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ha! Is it now?" she said. "Very well. Come and see me again before you go, and we'll see what you may take back with you. And I hopes you can close the doors you are opening. Now watch the people! Sometimes you see her!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany paid attention to the dance. The Fool had turned up without her noticing, wandering around collecting money in his greasy top hat. If a girl looked as though she'd squeal if he kissed her, he gave her a kiss. And sometimes, without any warning, he'd spring off into the dance, spinning through the men with never a foot in the wrong place.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Then Tiffany saw it. The eyes of a woman on the other side of the dance flashed gold, just for a moment. Once she'd seen it, she saw it again—in the eyes of a boy, a girl, the man holding the beer, moving around to watch the Fool—</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Summer's here!" said Tiffany, and realized that she was tapping her foot to the beat; she realized it because a heavier boot had just trodden on it and pinned it gently but firmly to the ground. Beside it, You looked up at her in blue-eyed innocence that became, for the briefest fragment of a second, the lazy golden eyes of a snake.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"She's meant to be," said Granny Weatherwax, removing her boot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"A few coppers for luck, miss?" said a voice close by, and there was the sound of money being shaken in an ancient hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Tiffany turned and looked into purple-gray eyes. The face around them was lined and tanned and grinning. He had a gold earring. "A copper or two from the lovely lady?" he wheedled. "Silver or gold, maybe?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Sometimes, Tiffany thought, you just know how it all should go….</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Iron?" she said, taking the ring off her finger and dropping it into the hat.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The Fool picked it out, delicately, and flipped it into the air. Tiffany's eye followed it, but somehow it wasn't in the air anymore but was glistening on the man's finger.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Iron's enough," he said, and gave her a sudden kiss on the cheek.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was only slightly chilly.</div>

      <div class="paragraph">The galleries inside the Feegle mound were crowded but hushed. This was important. The honor of the clan was at stake here.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">In the middle was a large book, taller than Rob and filled with colorful pictures. It was quite muddy from its journey down into the mound. Rob had been challenged. For years he'd thought himself to be a hero, and then the hag o' hags had said he wasna, no' really. Weel, you couldn't argue wi' the hag o' hags, but he wuz goin' to rise tae the challenge, oh aye, so he wuz, or his name wasna Rob Anybody.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Where's mah coo?" he read. "Is that mah coo? It gaes cluck! It is a…a…chicken! It is no' mah coo! An' then there's this wee paintin' o' a couple o' chickens. That's another page, right?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"It is indeed, Rob," said Billy Bigchin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was a cheer from the assembled Feegles as Rob ran around the book, waving his hands in the air.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' this one is a lot harder than Abker, right?" he said, when he'd done the circuit. "That one was easy! An' a very predictable plot. Whoever writted that book didna stretch himself, in ma opinion."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"You mean The ABC?" said Billy Bigchin.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye." Rob Anybody jumped up and down and punched the air a few times. "Got somethin' a wee bit tougher?"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The gonnagle looked at the stack of battered books the Feegles had, in various ways, collected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Somethin' I can get ma teeth intae," Rob added. "A big book."</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Well, this one's called Principles of Modern Accountancy," said Billy doubtfully.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"An' is that a big heroic book to read?" said Rob, running on the spot.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Aye. Probably, but—"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Rob Anybody held up a hand for silence and looked across at Jeannie, who had a crowd of little Feegles surrounding her. She was smiling at him, and his sons were staring at their father in silent astonishment. One day, Rob thought, they'll be able to walk up to even the longest words and give them a good kicking. Not even commas and those tricksie semicolonses will stop them!</div>
  <div class="paragraph">He had to be a hero.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">"Ah'm feelin' guid about this readin'," said Rob Anybody. "Bring it on!"</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And he read Principles of Modern Accountancy all morning, but just to make it interesting, he put lots of dragons in it.</div>

       he Morris dance…</div>
  <div class="paragraph">…is traditionally danced on May 1, to welcome in the summer. Its history is a bit confused, possibly because it's often danced near pubs, but it is now the English folk dance. The dancers usually wear white, and have bells sewn on their clothes. It is danced by both men and women, and is certainly now danced in the United States too.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I know this because I saw the Dark Morris danced in a bookshop in Chicago some years ago.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I'd invented the Dark Morris for another book called Reaper Man (at least I think I invented it), and a Morris team (officially known as a side) turned up in all black, just for me. They danced it in silence and perfect time, without the music and bells of the "summer" dance.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was beautifully done. But it was also a bit creepy. So it might not be a good idea to try it at home….</div>
